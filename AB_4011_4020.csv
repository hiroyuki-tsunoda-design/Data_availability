"backgroundhaemoglobin sc (hbsc) is a common form of sickle cell disease (scd), especially among individuals of west african ancestry. persons with hbsc disease suffer from the same clinical complications and reduced quality of life that affect those with sickle cell anaemia (hbss/s beta 0). retrospective anecdotal data suggest short-term safety and benefits of hydroxyurea for treating hbsc, yet rigorous prospective data are lacking regarding optimal dosing, clinical and laboratory effects, long-term safety and benefits, and appropriate endpoints to monitor. prospective investigation of variables as outcomes for treatment (pivot) was designed with three aims: (1) to measure the toxicities of hydroxyurea treatment on laboratory parameters, (2) to assess the effects of hydroxyurea treatment on sickle-related clinical and laboratory parameters, and (3) to identify study endpoints suitable for a future definitive phase iii trial of hydroxyurea treatment of hbsc disease.methodspivot is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical trial of hydroxyurea. approximately 120 children and 120 adults ages 5-50 years with hbsc disease will be enrolled, screened for 2 months, and then randomised 1:1 to once-daily oral hydroxyurea or placebo. study treatment will be prescribed initially at 20 +/- 5 mg/kg/day with an opportunity to escalate the dose twice over the first 6 months. after 12 months of blinded study treatment, all participants will be offered open-label hydroxyurea for up to 4 years. safety outcomes include treatment-related cytopenias, whole blood viscosity, and adverse events. efficacy outcomes include a variety of laboratory and clinical parameters over the first 12 months of randomised treatment, including changes in haemoglobin and fetal haemoglobin, intracranial arterial velocities measured by transcranial doppler ultrasound, cerebral oxygenation using near infrared spectrometry, spleen volume and kidney size by ultrasound, proteinuria, and retinal imaging. exploratory outcomes include functional erythrocyte analyses with ektacytometry for red blood cell deformability and point-of-sickling, patient-reported outcomes using the promis questionnaire, and 6-min walk test.discussionfor children and adults with hbsc disease, pivot will determine the safety of hydroxyurea and identify measurable changes in laboratory and clinical parameters, suitable for future prospective testing in a definitive multi-centre phase iii clinical trial.trial registrationpactr, pactr202108893981080. registered 24 august 2021, https://pactr.samrc.ac.za",AB_0402
"motivation genome-wide association studies (gwas) present several computational and statistical challenges for their data analysis, including knowledge discovery, interpretability, and translation to clinical practice.results we develop, apply, and comparatively evaluate an automated machine learning (automl) approach, customized for genomic data that delivers reliable predictive and diagnostic models, the set of genetic variants that are important for predictions (called a biosignature), and an estimate of the out-of-sample predictive power. this automl approach discovers variants with higher predictive performance compared to standard gwas methods, computes an individual risk prediction score, generalizes to new, unseen data, is shown to better differentiate causal variants from other highly correlated variants, and enhances knowledge discovery and interpretability by reporting multiple equivalent biosignatures.availability and implementation code for this study is available at: https://github.com/mensxmachina/automl-gwas. jadbio offers a free version at: https://jadbio.com/sign-up/. snp data can be downloaded from the ega repository (https://ega-archive.org/). prs data are found at: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/opensnp-height-prediction. simulation data to study population structure can be found at: https://easygwas.ethz.ch/data/public/dataset/view/1/.",AB_0402
"analysis of eukaryotic genomes requires the detection and classification of transposable elements (tes), a crucial but complex and time-consuming task. to improve the performance of tools that accomplish these tasks, machine learning approaches (ml) that leverage computer resources, such as gpus (graphical processing unit) and multiple cpu (central processing unit) cores, have been adopted. however, until now, the use of ml techniques has mostly been limited to classification of tes. herein, a detection-classification strategy (named yoro) based on convolutional neural networks is adapted from computer vision (yolo) to genomics. this approach enables the detection of genomic objects through the prediction of the position, length, and classification in large dna sequences such as fully sequenced genomes. as a proof of concept, the internal protein-coding domains of ltr-retrotransposons are used to train the proposed neural network. precision, recall, accuracy, f1-score, execution times and time ratios, as well as several graphical representations were used as metrics to measure performance. these promising results open the door for a new generation of deep learning tools for genomics. yoro architecture is available at https://github.com/simonorozcoarias/yoro.",AB_0402
"background: previous studies comparing percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) with coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) in patients with multivessel coronary disease not involving the left main have shown significantly lower rates of death, myocardial infarction (mi), or stroke after cabg. these studies did not routinely use current-generation drug-eluting stents or fractional flow reserve (ffr) to guide pci. methods: fame 3 (fractional flow reserve versus angiography for multivessel evaluation) is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, international, randomized trial involving patients with 3-vessel coronary artery disease (not involving the left main coronary artery) in 48 centers worldwide. patients were randomly assigned to receive ffr-guided pci using zotarolimus drug-eluting stents or cabg. the prespecified key secondary end point of the trial reported here is the 3-year incidence of the composite of death, mi, or stroke. results: a total of 1500 patients were randomized to ffr-guided pci or cabg. follow-up was achieved in >96% of patients in both groups. there was no difference in the incidence of the composite of death, mi, or stroke after ffr-guided pci compared with cabg (12.0% versus 9.2%; hazard ratio [hr], 1.3 [95% ci, 0.98-1.83]; p=0.07). the rates of death (4.1% versus 3.9%; hr, 1.0 [95% ci, 0.6-1.7]; p=0.88) and stroke (1.6% versus 2.0%; hr, 0.8 [95% ci, 0.4-1.7]; p=0.56) were not different. mi occurred more frequently after pci (7.0% versus 4.2%; hr, 1.7 [95% ci, 1.1-2.7]; p=0.02). conclusions: at 3-year follow-up, there was no difference in the incidence of the composite of death, mi, or stroke after ffr-guided pci with current-generation drug-eluting stents compared with cabg. there was a higher incidence of mi after pci compared with cabg, with no difference in death or stroke. these results provide contemporary data to allow improved shared decision-making between physicians and patients with 3-vessel coronary artery disease. registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct02100722.",AB_0402
"next-generation sequencing (ngs)-based clonality analysis allows in-depth assessment of the clonal composition of a sample with high sensitivity for detecting small clones. within the euroclonality-ngs working group, a protocol for ngs ig clonality analysis was developed and validated previously. this ngs-based approach was designed to generate small amplicons, making it suitable for samples with suboptimal dna quality, especially material derived from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. using expert assessment of ngs ig clonality results as a reference, a structured algorithmic approach to the assessment of ngs-amplicon-based b-cell clonality analysis was developed. a structured approach with the detection of clonality through evaluation of sample quality and assessment of pattern, abundance and ratio (depart) algorithm was proposed, which consecutively evaluates sample quality, the pattern of the clonotypes present, the abundance of the most dominant clonotypes, and the ratio between the dominant clonotypes and the background to evaluate the different ig gene targets. specific issues with respect to evaluation of the various ig targets as well as the integration of results of individual targets into a molecular clonality conclusion are discussed and illustrated with case examples. finally, the importance of interpretation of ngs-based clonality results in clinical and histopathologic contexts is discussed. it is expected that these recommendations will have clinical utility to facilitate proper evaluation of clonality assessment.

"background:ventricular arrhythmia is an important cause of mortality in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. revascularization with coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous coronary intervention is often recommended for these patients before implantation of a cardiac defibrillator because it is assumed that this may reduce the incidence of fatal and potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias, although this premise has not been evaluated in a randomized trial to date.methods:patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, extensive coronary disease, and viable myocardium were randomly assigned to receive either percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) plus optimal medical and device therapy (omt) or omt alone. the composite primary outcome was all-cause death or aborted sudden death (defined as an appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy or a resuscitated cardiac arrest) at a minimum of 24 months, analyzed as time to first event on an intention-to-treat basis. secondary outcomes included cardiovascular death or aborted sudden death, appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (icd) therapy or sustained ventricular arrhythmia, and number of appropriate icd therapies.results:between august 28, 2013, and march 19, 2020, 700 patients were enrolled across 40 centers in the united kingdom. a total of 347 patients were assigned to the pci+omt group and 353 to the omt alone group. the mean age of participants was 69 years; 88% were male; 56% had hypertension; 41% had diabetes; and 53% had a clinical history of myocardial infarction. the median left ventricular ejection fraction was 28%; 53.1% had an implantable defibrillator inserted before randomization or during follow-up. all-cause death or aborted sudden death occurred in 144 patients (41.6%) in the pci group and 142 patients (40.2%) in the omt group (hazard ratio, 1.03 [95% ci, 0.82-1.30]; p=0.80). there was no between-group difference in the occurrence of any of the secondary outcomes.conclusions:pci was not associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality or aborted sudden death. in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, pci is not beneficial solely for the purpose of reducing potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias.registration:url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct01920048.",AB_0402
"precise cell nucleus segmentation is very critical in many biologically related analyses and disease diagnoses. however, the variability in nuclei structure, color, and modalities of histopathology images make the automatic computer-aided nuclei segmentation task very difficult. traditional encoder-decoder based deep learning schemes mainly utilize the spatial domain information that may limit the performance of recognizing small nuclei regions in subsequent downsampling operations. in this paper, a boundary aware wavelet guided network (bawgnet) is proposed by incorporating a boundary aware unit along with an attention mechanism based on a wavelet domain guidance in each stage of the encoder-decoder output. here the high-frequency 2 dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2d-dwt) coefficients are utilized in the attention mechanism to guide the spatial information obtained from the encoder-decoder output stages to leverage the nuclei segmentation task. on the other hand, the boundary aware unit (bau) captures the nuclei's boundary information, ensuring accurate prediction of the nuclei pixels in the edge region. furthermore, the preprocessing steps used in our methodology confirm the data's uniformity by converting it to similar color statistics. extensive experimentations conducted on three benchmark histopathology datasets (dsb, monuseg and tnbc) exhibit the outstanding segmentation performance of the proposed method (with dice scores 90.82%, 85.74%, and 78.57%, respectively). implementation of the proposed architecture is available at https://github.com/tamjidimtiaz/bawgnet.",AB_0402
"demand for coconut is expected to rise, but the global distribution of coconut palm has been studied little, which hinders the discussion of its impacts. here, we produced the first 20 m global coconut palm layer using a u-net model that was trained on annual sentinel-1 and sentinel-2 composites for the year 2020. the overall accuracy was 99.04 +/- 0.21 %, which was significantly higher than the no-information rate. the producer's accuracy for coconut palm was 71.51 +/- 23.11 % when only closed-canopy coconut palm was considered in the validation, but this decreased to 11.30 +/- 2.33 % when sparse and dense open-canopy coconut palm was also taken into account. this indicates that sparse and dense open-canopy coconut palm remains difficult to map with accuracy. we report a global coconut palm area of 12.66 +/- 3.96 x 10(6) ha for dense open- and closed-canopy coconut palm, but the estimate is 3 times larger (38.93 +/- 7.89 x 10(6) ha) when sparse coconut palm is included in the area estimation. the large area of sparse coconut palm is important as it indicates that production increases can likely be achieved on the existing lands allocated to coconut. the philippines, indonesia, and india account for most of the global coconut palm area, representing approximately 82 % of the total mapped area. our study provides the high-resolution, quantitative, and precise data necessary for assessing the relationships between coconut production and the synergies and trade-offs between various sustainable development goal indicators. the global coconut palm layer is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8128183 (descals, 2023).",AB_0402
"escherichia coli significantly causes nosocomial infections and rampant spread of antimicrobial resistance (amr). there is limited data on genomic characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing e. coli from african clinical settings. this hospital-based longitudinal study unraveled the genetic resistance elements in esbl e. coli isolates from uganda and tanzania using whole-genome sequencing (wgs). a total of 142 esbl multi-drug resistant e. coli bacterial isolates from both tanzania and uganda were sequenced and out of these, 36/57 (63.1%) and 67/85 (78.8%) originated from uganda and tanzania respectively. mutations in rard, yaaa and ybgl conferring resistances to chloramphenicol, peroxidase and quinolones were observed from ugandan and tanzanian isolates. we reported very high frequencies for bla(ctx-m-15) with 11/18(61.1%), and bla(ctx-m-27) with 12/23 (52.1%), bla(tem-1b) with 13/23 (56.5%) of isolates originating from uganda and tanzania respectively all conferring resistance to beta-lactam-penicillin inhibitors. we observed chloramphenicol resistance-conferring gene mdfa in 21/23 (91.3%) of tanzanian isolates. extraintestinal e. coli sequence type (st) 131 accounted for 5/59 (8.4%) of tanzanian isolates while enterotoxigenic e. coli st656 was reported in 9/34 (26.4%) of ugandan isolates. virulence factors originating from shigella dysenteriae sd197 (gspc, gspd, gspe, gspf, gspg, gspf, gsph, gspi), yersinia pestis co92 (irp1, ybtu, ybtx, iuca), salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium str. lt2 (csgf and csgg), and pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 (flha, flig, flim) were identified in these isolates. overall, this study highlights a concerning prevalence and diversity of amr-conferring elements shaping the genomic structure of multi-drug resistant e. coli in clinical settings in east africa. it underscores the urgent need to strengthen infection-prevention controls and advocate for the routine use of wgs in national amr surveillance and monitoring programs. availability of wgs analysis pipeline: the rmap source codes, installation, and implementation manual can free be accessed via https://github.com/gunzivan28/rmap.",AB_0402
"backgroundthere is ongoing debate regarding the treatment of severe and multiple traumatized children and adolescents with post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). many clinicians favor a phase-based treatment approach (i.e., a stabilization phase prior to trauma-focused therapy) over immediate trauma-focused psychological treatment, despite the lack of scientific evidence. research on the effects of different treatment approaches is needed for children and adolescents with (symptoms of complex) ptsd resulting from repeated sexual and/or physical abuse during childhood.objectivethis paper describes the rationale, study design, and methods of the mars-study, a two-arm randomized controlled trial (rct) that aims to compare the results of phase-based treatment with those of immediate trauma-focused treatment and determine whether immediate trauma-focused treatment is not worse than phase-based treatment in reducing ptsd symptoms.methodsparticipants are individuals between 12 and 18 years who meet the diagnostic criteria for ptsd due to repeated sexual abuse, physical abuse, or domestic violence during childhood. participants will be blindly allocated to either the phase-based or immediate trauma-focused treatment condition. in the phase-based treatment condition, participants receive 12 sessions of the dutch version of skill training in affective and interpersonal regulation (stair-a), followed by 12 sessions of emdr therapy. in the immediate trauma-focused condition, the participants receive 12 sessions of emdr therapy. the two groups are compared for several outcome variables before treatment, mid-treatment (only in the phase-based treatment condition), after 12 trauma-focused treatment sessions (post-treatment), and six months post-treatment (follow-up). the main parameter is the presence and severity of ptsd symptoms (clinician-administered ptsd scale for children and adolescents, caps-ca). the secondary outcome variables are the severity of complex ptsd symptoms (interpersonal problems as measured by the experiences in close relationship-revised, ecr-rc; emotion regulation as measured by the difficulties in emotion regulation scale, ders; self esteem as measured by the rosenberg self esteem scale, rses), changes in anxiety and mood symptoms (revised anxiety and depression scale; rcads), changes in posttraumatic cognitions (child posttraumatic cognitions inventory, cptci), changes in general psychopathology symptoms (child behavior checklist, cbcl), and quality of life (youth outcome questionnaire, y-oq-30). furthermore, parental stress (opvoedingsvragenlijst, obvl) and patient-therapist relationship (feedback informed treatment, fit) will be measured, whereas ptsd symptoms will be monitored in each session during both treatment conditions (children's revised impact of event scale, cries-13).discussiontreating (symptoms of complex) ptsd in children and adolescents with a history of repeated sexual and/or physical abuse during childhood is of great importance. however, there is a lack of consensus among trauma experts regarding the optimal treatment approach. the results of the current study may have important implications for selecting effective treatment options for clinicians working with children and adolescents who experience the effects of exposure to multiple interpersonal traumatic events during childhood.trial registrationsthe study was registered on the national trial register (ntr) with the number ntr7024. this registry was obtained from the international clinical trial registry platform (ictrp) and can be accessed through the ictrp search portal (https://trialsearch.who.int/).",AB_0402
