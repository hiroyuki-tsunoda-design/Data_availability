"we present a novel approach for solving the time-dependent schrodinger equation (tdse). the method we propose converts the tdse to an equivalent volterra integral equation; introducing a global lagrange interpolation of the integrand transforms the equation to a linear system, which is then solved iteratively. in this paper, we derive the method, explore its performance on several examples, and discuss the corresponding numerical details.program summaryprogram title: iterative volterra propagator (itvolt)cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /jzd5xpv6t7.1developer's repository link: https://github .com /ry-schneider /iterative _volterra _propagator.gitlicensing provisions: mitprogramming language: modern fortrannature of problem: itvolt is a solver for the time-dependent schrodinger equation (tdse). more broadly, it can be applied to any problem that can be written as a volterra integral equation.solution method: itvolt solves a volterra integral equation representation of the tdse by reducing it to a linear system via lagrange interpolation of the integrand. it then solves the system iteratively with one of several iteration schemes.additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: general subroutines assume that the hamiltonian for the tdse being solved can be represented by a symmetric banded matrix whose time -dependent component is some scalar function of time (for example a pulse) multiplied by a fixed matrix.& copy; 2023 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ( .org /licenses /by /4 .0/).",AB_0580
"epistasis, commonly defined as the interaction between genetic loci, is known to play an important role in the phenotypic variation of complex traits. as a result, many statistical methods have been developed to identify genetic variants that are involved in epistasis, and nearly all of these approaches carry out this task by focusing on analyzing one trait at a time. previous studies have shown that jointly modeling multiple phenotypes can often dramatically increase statistical power for association mapping. in this study, we present the multivariate marginal epistasis test (mvmapit)-a multioutcome generalization of a recently proposed epistatic detection method which seeks to detect marginal epistasis or the combined pairwise interaction effects between a given variant and all other variants. by searching for marginal epistatic effects, one can identify genetic variants that are involved in epistasis without the need to identify the exact partners with which the variants interact-thus, potentially alleviating much of the statistical and computational burden associated with conventional explicit search-based methods. our proposed mvmapit builds upon this strategy by taking advantage of correlation structure between traits to improve the identification of variants involved in epistasis. we formulate mvmapit as a multivariate linear mixed model and develop a multitrait variance component estimation algorithm for efficient parameter inference and p-value computation. together with reasonable model approximations, our proposed approach is scalable to moderately sized genomewide association studies. with simulations, we illustrate the benefits of mvmapit over univariate (or single-trait) epistatic mapping strategies. we also apply mvmapit framework to protein sequence data from two broadly neutralizing anti-influenza antibodies and approximately 2,000 heterogeneous stock of mice from the wellcome trust centre for human genetics. the mvmapit r package can be downloaded at https://github.com/lcrawlab/mvmapit.",AB_0580
"recent studies on traffic congestion prediction have paved a promising path towards the reduction of potential economic and environmental loss. however, at the city-wide scale, current approaches face substantial hurdles, such as being unable to support the multiple sensors modalities, insufficient congestion fluctuation and propagation modeling, and weak generalization to heterogeneous traffic network structures. to address these pitfalls, this paper investigates how to integrate the missing urban science domain priors into a general sequential prediction model, and proposes the customized traffic-informed transformer (tint). to prevent receptive field bias, a novel mixture of long and short range information routing mechanism is proposed with the traffic-informed tokenization. to capture the unbalanced traffic flow propagation, an original anisotropic graph aggregation is developed to differentiate the traffic fluctuation based on orientations. extensive results demonstrated tint's outstanding performance over other twelve state-of-the-art models and its broad applicability to multiple data modalities in six well-known cities throughout the world. we released our implementations at: https://github.com/vita-group/tint.",AB_0580
"the alpha jet atmospheric experiment (ajax) flew scientific flights between 2011 and 2018 providing measurements of trace gas species and meteorological parameters over california and nevada, usa. this paper describes the observations made by the ajax program over 229 flights and approximately 450 h of flying. ajax was a multi-year, multi-objective, multi-instrument program with a variety of sampling strategies resulting in an extensive dataset of interest to a wide variety of users. some of the more common flight objectives include satellite calibration/validation (gosat, oco-2, tropomi) at railroad valley and other locations and long-term observations of free-tropospheric and boundary layer ozone allowing for studies of stratosphereto-troposphere transport and long-range transport to the western united states. ajax also performed topical studies such as sampling wildfire emissions, urban outflow and atmospheric rivers. airborne measurements of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, formaldehyde, water vapor, temperature, pressure and 3-d winds made by the ajax program have been published at nasa's airborne science data center (https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/project/ ajaxts9 (last access: 1 november 2022), https://doi.org/10.5067/asdc/suborbital/ajax/data001, iraci et al., 2021a).",AB_0580
"time-dependent ginzburg-landau (tdgl) theory is a phenomenological model for the dynamics of superconducting systems. due to its simplicity in comparison to microscopic theories and its effectiveness in describing the observed properties of the superconducting state, tdgl is widely used to interpret or explain measurements of superconducting devices. here, we introduce pytdgl, a python package that solves a generalized tdgl model for superconducting thin films of arbitrary geometry, enabling simulations of vortex and phase dynamics in mesoscopic superconducting devices. pytdgl can model the nonlinear magnetic response and dynamics of multiply connected films, films with multiple current bias terminals, and films with a spatially inhomogeneous critical temperature. we demonstrate these capabilities by modeling quasi-equilibrium vortex distributions in irregularly shaped films, and the dynamics and current-voltage-field characteristics of nanoscale superconducting quantum interference devices (nanosquids). program summary program title: pytdgl cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /t6z7szt9bj .1 developer's repository link: http://www.github .com /loganbvh /py-tdgl code ocean capsule: https://codeocean .com /capsule /2460583 licensing provisions: mit license programming language: python nature of problem: pytdgl solves a generalized time-dependent ginzburg-landau (tdgl) equation for two-dimensional superconductors of arbitrary geometry, enabling simulations of vortex and phase slip dynamics in thin film superconducting devices. solution method:: the package uses a finite volume adaptive euler method to solve a coupled tdgl and poisson equation in two dimensions.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0580

"antibiotic administration during early life has been shown to have lasting effects on the gut microbiota, which have been linked to sustained alterations in liver metabolism and adiposity. recent investigations have discerned that the gut microbiota continues to develop toward an adult-like profile during adolescence. however, the impact of antibiotic exposure during adolescence on metabolism and adiposity is unclear. herein, a retrospective analysis of medicaid claims data was performed, which indicated that tetracycline class antibiotics are commonly prescribed for the systemic treatment of adolescent acne. the purpose of this was to discern the impact of a prolonged tetracycline antibiotic exposure during adolescence on the gut microbiota, liver metabolism, and adiposity. male c57bl/6t specific pathogen-free mice were administered a tetracycline antibiotic during the pubertal/postpubertal adolescent growth phase. groups were euthanized at different time points to assess immediate and sustained antibiotic treatment effects. antibiotic exposure during adolescence caused lasting genera-level shifts in the intestinal bacteriome and persistent dysregulation of metabolic pathways in the liver. dysregulated hepatic metabolism was linked to sustained disruption of the intestinal farnesoid x receptor-fibroblast growth factor 15 axis, a gut-liver endocrine axis that supports metabolic homeostasis. antibiotic exposure during adolescence increased subcutaneous, visceral, and marrow adiposity, which intriguingly manifested following antibiotic therapy. this preclinical work highlights that prolonged antibiotic courses for the clinical treatment of adolescent acne may have unintended deleterious effects on liver metabolism and adiposity.

"field-of-view (fov) tissue truncation beyond the lungs is common in routine lung screening computed tomography (ct). this poses limitations for opportunistic ct-based body composition (bc) assessment as key anatomical structures are missing. traditionally, extending the fov of ct is considered as a ct reconstruction problem using limited data. however, this approach relies on the projection domain data which might not be available in application. in this work, we formulate the problem from the semantic image extension perspective which only requires image data as inputs. the proposed two-stage method identifies a new fov border based on the estimated extent of the complete body and imputes missing tissues in the truncated region. the training samples are simulated using ct slices with complete body in fov, making the model development self -supervised. we evaluate the validity of the proposed method in automatic bc assessment using lung screening ct with limited fov. the proposed method effectively restores the missing tissues and reduces bc assessment error introduced by fov tissue truncation. in the bc assessment for large-scale lung screening ct datasets, this correction improves both the intra-subject consistency and the correlation with anthropometric approximations. the developed method is available at https://github.com/masilab/s-efov.",AB_0580
"this paper introduces jax-fem, an open-source differentiable finite element method (fem) library. constructed on top of google jax, a rising machine learning library focusing on high-performance numerical computing, jax-fem is implemented with pure python while scalable to efficiently solve problems with moderate to large sizes. for example, in a 3d tensile loading problem with 7.7 million degrees of freedom, jax-fem with gpu achieves around 10x acceleration compared to a commercial fem code depending on platform. beyond efficiently solving forward problems, jax-fem employs the automatic differentiation technique so that inverse problems are solved in a fully automatic manner without the need to manually derive sensitivities. examples of 3d topology optimization of nonlinear materials are shown to achieve optimal compliance. finally, jax-fem is an integrated platform for machine learning-aided computational mechanics. we show an example of data-driven multi-scale computations of a composite material where jax-fem provides an all-in-one solution from microscopic data generation and model training to macroscopic fe computations. the source code of the library and these examples are shared with the community to facilitate computational mechanics research.program summaryprogram title: jax-femcpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /hgwshjbcw6 .1developer's repository link: https://github .com /tianjuxue /jax -am /tree /main /jax _am /femlicensing provisions: gplv3programming language: pythonnature of problem: implementation of the finite element method (fem) with several appealing features that classic fem software typically does not have: realized with pure python; running on cpu/gpu; differentiable for solving pde-constrained optimization problems; seamless integration with machine learning.solution method: our framework jax-fem is based on google jax, a high-performance numerical computing library with automatic differentiation features and supporting both cpu/gpu. unlike classic fem software written in fortran or c/c++, jax-fem is implemented with pure python and can easily be installed as a python package. we demonstrate our software by solving problems including forward pde prediction, inverse design/optimization, and data-driven analysis.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0580
"background and objective: histopathology is the gold standard for diagnosis of many cancers. recent advances in computer vision, specifically deep learning, have facilitated the analysis of histopathology images for many tasks, including the detection of immune cells and microsatellite instability. however, it remains difficult to identify optimal models and training configurations for different histopathology classification tasks due to the abundance of available architectures and the lack of systematic evaluations. our objective in this work is to present a software tool that addresses this need and enables robust, systematic evaluation of neural network models for patch classification in histology in a light-weight, easy-to-use package for both algorithm developers and biomedical researchers.methods: here we present champkit (comprehensive histopathology assessment of model predictions toolkit): an extensible, fully reproducible evaluation toolkit that is a one-stop-shop to train and evalu-ate deep neural networks for patch classification. champkit curates a broad range of public datasets. it enables training and evaluation of models supported by timm directly from the command line, with-out the need for users to write any code. external models are enabled through a straightforward api and minimal coding. as a result, champkit facilitates the evaluation of existing and new models and deep learning architectures on pathology datasets, making it more accessible to the broader scientific community. to demonstrate the utility of champkit, we establish baseline performance for a subset of possible models that could be employed with champkit, focusing on several popular deep learning mod -els, namely resnet18, resnet50, and r26-vit, a hybrid vision transformer. in addition, we compare each model trained either from random weight initialization or with transfer learning from imagenet pre-trained models. for resnet18, we also consider transfer learning from a self-supervised pretrained model. results: the main result of this paper is the champkit software. using champkit, we were able to sys-temically evaluate multiple neural networks across six datasets. we observed mixed results when evalu-ating the benefits of pretraining versus random intialization, with no clear benefit except in the low data regime, where transfer learning was found to be beneficial. surprisingly, we found that transfer learning from self-supervised weights rarely improved performance, which is counter to other areas of computer vision.conclusions: choosing the right model for a given digital pathology dataset is nontrivial. champkit pro-vides a valuable tool to fill this gap by enabling the evaluation of hundreds of existing (or user-defined) deep learning models across a variety of pathology tasks. source code and data for the tool are freely accessible at https://github.com/sbu-bmi/champkit .& copy; 2023 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (  )",AB_0580
