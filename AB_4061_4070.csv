"we present the program suspect3 that calculates the masses and couplings of the higgs and supersymmetric particles predicted by the minimal supersymmetric standard model (mssm). the model is implemented in both its non-constrained version, the mssm, and its constrained versions, such as the minimal supergravity and the gauge or anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking models, in which the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters obey certain universal boundary conditions at the high energy scale. the low energy parameters are then obtained using renormalization group equations and electroweak symmetry breaking, and all the dominant radiative corrections have been consistently implemented. suspect3 is a major rewrite, in c++ object oriented programming, of the fortran code suspect. it includes all the features of the earlier code in an improved and updated manner, and involves new options such as compressed susy scenarios, an mssm-inflation model and the possibility of using the observed higgs mass as an input. the main features and the use of the program are explained.program summary program title: suspect3cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /55jv4kdrm8 .1developer's repository link: http://suspect .in2p3 .frlicensing provisions: gplv3programming language: c++, compatible c++98, c++11, c++14, c++17 nature of problem: supersymmetric models such as the mssm, msugra, gmsb, amsb and others have specific parameter sets and boundary conditions. suspect3 translates the parameter sets of the models into predictions of the higgs and supersymmetric particles masses. the mixing matrices of the physical states as well as the mixing angles are calculated in addition to the scale dependent parameters.solution method: the spectrum of the higgs and supersymmetric particles depends on the model, its supersymmetric parameter set and the standard model parameters. the evolution of the parameters as function of the energy scale is calculated by solving numerically the renormalization group equations. model dependent boundary conditions are applied at the appropriate scale. electroweak symmetry breaking is calculated iteratively at the electroweak scale. the application of radiative corrections translate the scale dependent particle masses into the physical pole masses.",AB_0407
"in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the utilization of tourism recommendation systems (trs) to enhance tourist satisfaction. however, planning a trip can be a daunting and time-consuming process, leading to concerns for travelers. this paper focuses on developing a highly personalized trs that considers the complexities and limitations of tour itinerary planning. to achieve this, we propose an extension of the constrained orienteering problem that selects the most suitable attractions based on various constraints, such as maximum tour duration, mandatory visits, and start and end locations. in addition, we introduce the use of tier constraints to limit the time spent on similar attractions. in this study, we also propose a novel personalization approach that considers the individual preferences of tourists and generates personalized ratings for points of interest. next, we focus on developing a new greedy genetic algorithm to address the np-hard problem of finding optimal or near-optimal solutions. to assess the performance of the developed algorithm, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of the input parameters. using different user profiles, we demonstrated its effectiveness on a real-world london city dataset. moreover, we conducted a comparative experimental analysis of the algorithm with four baseline algorithms, and the results were statistically analyzed using non-parametric tests such as wilcoxon and friedman. our algorithm achieved the best-known solutions for 100% of the instances tested, demonstrating its efficiency for large-scale problems with 200-300 points of interest. furthermore, our trs provides highly personalized tourist trips, making it a valuable tool for tourists. the new greedy genetic algorithm and unique personalization approach are significant features of the new globetrott tourist recommendation system, which is accessible on popular mobile operating systems and through the website at https://www.globetrott.com/.",AB_0407
"the family inversiulidae, and its only genus inversiula, are unique among cheilostome bryozoans owing to the reverse orientation of the operculum, which hinges distally instead of proximally. inversiula currently includes four extant and one fossil species almost exclusively distributed in the southern hemisphere. a phylogenetic analysis of the inversiulidae based on morphological characters was performed, showing the existence of two clades with contrasting development of the frontal shield. as a result of this analysis, parainversiula gen. nov. is erected to contain inversiulid species with an umbonuloid frontal shield structure and fewer than 30 central spoked pores. two poorly known fossil species from the early miocene of patagonia (argentina), originally assigned to the genus microporella, are here redescribed as parainversiula sp. and p. chubutiana (canu) comb. nov. the historical, time-calibrated biogeography of inversiulidae was estimated using an event-based, multi-model quantitative analysis. the analyses estimated that australasia was the ancestral area of parainversiula and a dispersion of the genus into south america occurred between the late eocene and oligocene (c. 23-42 ma), an event that could have been helped by the origin of the antarctic circumpolar current.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:a2cff6ce-9bc4-4d07-aa4a-890cc1f372d3",AB_0407
"objective high-grade gliomas (hggs) are among the rarest yet most aggressive tumor types in neurosurgical practice. in the current literature, few studies have assessed the drivers of early outcomes following resection of these tumors and investigated their association with quality of care. the authors aimed to identify the clinical predictors for 30-day readmission and reoperation following hgg surgery using the american college of surgeons (acs) national surgical quality improvement project (nsqip) database and sought to create web-based applications predicting each outcome. methods using the acs nsqip database, the authors conducted a retrospective, multicenter cohort analysis of patients who underwent resection of supratentorial hggs between january 1, 2016, and december 31, 2020. demographics and comorbidities were extracted. the primary outcomes were 30-day unplanned readmission and reoperation. a stratified 80:20 split of the available data was carried out. supervised machine learning algorithms were trained to predict 30-day outcomes. results a total of 9418 patients were included in our cohort. the observed rate of unplanned readmission within 30 days of surgery was 13.0% (n = 1221). in terms of predictors, weight, chronic steroid use, preoperative blood urea nitrogen level, and white blood cell count were associated with a higher risk of readmission. the observed rate of unplanned reoperation within 30 days of surgery was 5.2% (n = 489). in terms of predictors, increased weight, longer operative time, and more days between hospital admission and operation were associated with an increased risk of early reoperation. the random forest algorithm showed the highest predictive performance for early readmission (area under the curve [auc] = 0.967), while the xgboost algorithm showed the highest predictive performance for early reoperation (auc = 0.985). web-based tools for both outcomes were deployed (https://glioma-readmission.herokuapp.com/ and https://glioma-reoperation.herokuapp.com/). conclusions in this study, the authors provide the first nationwide analysis for short-term outcomes in patients undergoing resection of supratentorial hggs. multiple patient, hospital, and admission factors were associated with readmission and reoperation, confirmed by machine learning predicting patients' prognosis, leading to better planning preoperatively and subsequently improved personalized patient care.",AB_0407
"introductionwe previously assessed the effect of an onsite sanitation intervention in informal neighbourhoods of urban maputo, mozambique on enteric pathogen detection in children after 2 years of follow-up (maputo sanitation (mapsan) trial, clinicaltrials.gov: nct02362932). we found significant reductions in shigella and trichuris prevalence but only among children born after the intervention was delivered. in this study, we assess the health impacts of the sanitation intervention after 5 years among children born into study households postintervention.methods and analysiswe are conducting a cross-sectional household study of enteric pathogen detection in child stool and the environment at compounds (household clusters sharing sanitation and outdoor living space) that received the pour-flush toilet and septic tank intervention at least 5 years prior or meet the original criteria for trial control sites. we are enrolling at least 400 children (ages 29 days to 60 months) in each treatment arm. our primary outcome is the prevalence of 22 bacterial, protozoan, and soil transmitted helminth enteric pathogens in child stool using the pooled prevalence ratio across the outcome set to assess the overall intervention effect. secondary outcomes include the individual pathogen detection prevalence and gene copy density of 27 enteric pathogens (including viruses); mean height-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-height z-scores; prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting; and the 7-day period prevalence of caregiver-reported diarrhoea. all analyses are adjusted for prespecified covariates and examined for effect measure modification by age. environmental samples from study households and the public domain are assessed for pathogens and faecal indicators to explore environmental exposures and monitor disease transmission.ethics and disseminationstudy protocols have been reviewed and approved by human subjects review boards at the ministry of health, republic of mozambique and the university of north carolina at chapel hill. deidentified study data will be deposited at https://osf.io/e7pvk/.trial registration numberisrctn86084138.",AB_0407
"this study aims toinvestigate the potential benefits of adaptingthe ablating grid in two-dimensional (2d) and three-dimensional (3d)laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in a singlepulse mapping mode. the goals include enhancing the accuracy of surfacesampling of element distributions, improving the control of depth-relatedsampling, smoothing the post-ablation surface for layer-by-layer sampling,and increasing the image quality. to emulate the capabilities of currentlyunavailable laser ablation stages, a computational approach usinggeometrical modeling was employed to compound square or round experimentallyobtained 3d crater profiles on variable orthogonal or hexagonal ablationgrids. these grids were optimized by minimizing surface roughnessas a function of average ablation depth, followed by simulating thepost-ablation surface and related image quality. an online application(https://laicpms-apps.ki.si/webapps/home/) is available for users to virtually experiment with contracting/expandingorthogonal and hexagonal ablation grids for generic 3d super-gaussianlaser crater profiles, allowing for exploration of the resulting post-ablationsurface layer roughness and depth.",AB_0407
"background: using tailored mobile health interventions to improve global vascular risk awareness and control is yet to be investigated for primary stroke prevention in africa. methods: this 2-arm pilot randomized controlled trial involved 100 stroke-free adults with at least 2 vascular risk factors for stroke. eligible participants were assigned randomly to a control arm offering 1-time counseling (n=50) or a 2-month educational intervention arm (n=50) comprising a stroke video and riskometer app aimed at improving stroke risk factor awareness and health-seeking behavioral modification to control total vascular risk. reduction in total stroke risk score was the primary outcome while feasibility and process measures were secondary outcomes. results: all enrolled participants completed the 2-month follow-up (retention rate=100%). the mean (sd) age of participants was 59.5 (+/- 12.5) years, 38% were males. the mean change in stroke risk score at 2 months was -11.9% (+/- 14.2) in the intervention arm versus -1.2% (+/- 9.1) in the control arm, p=0.0001. stroke risk awareness improved by 16.1% (+/- 24.7) in the intervention arm versus 8.9% (+/- 24.7) in the control arm, p=0.08. the intervention arm had 11.1 mm hg reduction in systolic blood pressure compared with 4.8 mm hg reduction in the control arm. conclusions: the intervention demonstrated a positive signal of effect over a 2-month period. a definitive clinical trial with a longer duration of follow-up is warranted on the premise of these promising findings from this pilot randomized clinical trial. registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct05619406.",AB_0407
"objective radiological progression occurs in 50%-60% of residual nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (nfpas). stereotactic radiosurgery (srs) is a safe and effective management option for residual nfpas, but there is no consen-sus on its optimal timing. this study aims to define the optimal timing of srs for residual nfpas. methods this retrospective, multicenter study involved 375 patients with residual nfpas managed with srs. the patients were divided into adjuvant (adj; treated for stable residual nfpa within 6 months of resection) and progression (prg) cohorts (treated for residual nfpa progression). factors associated with tumor progression and clinical deteriora-tion were analyzed.results following propensity-score matching, each cohort consisted of 130 patients. at last follow-up, tumor con-trol was achieved in 93.1% of patients in the adj cohort and in 96.2% of patients in the prg cohort (hr 1.6, 95% ci 0.55-4.9, p = 0.37). hypopituitarism was associated with a maximum point dose of > 8 gy to the pituitary stalk (hr 4.5, 95% ci 1.6-12.6, p = 0.004). no statistically significant difference was noted in crude new-onset hypopituitarism rates (risk difference [rd] = -0.8%, p > 0.99) or visual deficits (rd = -2.3%, p = 0.21) between the two cohorts at the last follow-up. the median time from resection to new hypopituitarism was longer in the prg cohort (58.9 vs 29.7 months, p = 0.01).conclusions srs at residual nfpa progression does not appear to alter the probability of tumor control or hormon-al/visual deficits compared with adjuvant srs. deferral of radiosurgical management to the time of radiological progres- sion could significantly prolong the time to radiosurgically induced pituitary dysfunction. a lower maximum point dose (< 8 gy) to the pituitary stalk portended a more favorable chance of preserving pituitary function after srs. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.10.jns221873",AB_0407
"objectives allele counts of sequence variants obtained by whole genome sequencing (wgs) often play a central role in interpreting the results of genetic and genomic research. however, such variant counts are not readily available for individuals in the danish population. here, we present a dataset with allele counts for sequence variants (single nucleotide variants (snvs) and indels) identified from wgs of 8,671 (5,418 females) individuals from the danish population. the data resource is based on wgs data from three independent research projects aimed at assessing genetic risk factors for cardiovascular, psychiatric, and headache disorders. to enable the sharing of information on sequence variation in danish individuals, we created summarized statistics on allele counts from anonymized data and made them available through the european genome-phenome archive (ega, https://identifiers.org/ega.dataset:egad0 0001009756) and in a dedicated browser, danmac5 (available at www.danmac5.dk). the summary level data and the danmac5 browser provide insight into the allelic spectrum of sequence variants segregating in the danish population, which is important in variant interpretation.data description three wgs datasets with an average coverage of 30x were processed independently using the same quality control pipeline. subsequently, we summarized, filtered, and merged allele counts to create a high -quality summary level dataset of sequence variants.",AB_0407
"two species of teiichispira yochelson and jones reported from the early/middle ordovician marine deposits of the san juan formation in the argentine precordillera are described. the new species teiichispira teresae n. sp. is a component of the early/middle ordovician marine gastropod assemblage in the studied region; teiichispira argentina (kayser), previously known from the san juan formation, is described with a complete teleoconch and associated operculum. the opercula of both teiichispira species are complete and preserved in life position associated with the shell of t. argentina. the unguiculate morphology of the operculum is here interpreted as a mechanism for increasing the shell weight and ensuring anchoring to the substrate in a more or less fixed mode of life for teiichispira, and as protection. the new occurrence of teiichispira provides new taxonomic data on early paleozoic marine gastropods in argentina and testifies to a wide paleobiogeographical distribution for the genus, restricted to tropical and subtropical regions during the early/middle ordovician.uuid: http://zoobank.org/8ee48319-b17a-4d15-a7d4-99cc9bb1dc42",AB_0407
