"fragment-based drug design uses data about where, andhow strongly,small chemical fragments bind to proteins, to assemble new drug molecules.over the past decade, we have been successfully using fragment data,derived from thermodynamically rigorous monte carlo fragment-proteinbinding simulations, in dozens of preclinical drug programs. however,this approach has not been available to the broader research communitybecause of the cost and complexity of doing simulations and usingdesign tools. we have developed a web application, called bmaps, tomake fragment-based drug design widely available with greatly simplifieduser interfaces. bmaps provides access to a large repository (>550)of proteins with 100s of precomputed fragment maps, druggable hotspots, and high-quality water maps. users can also employ their ownstructures or those from the protein data bank and alphafold db. multigigabytedata sets are searched to find fragments in bondable orientations,ranked by a binding-free energy metric. the designers use this toselect modifications that improve affinity and other properties. bmapsis unique in combining conventional tools such as docking and energyminimization with fragment-based design, in a very easy to use andautomated web application. the service is available at https://www.boltzmannmaps.com.",AB_0515
"motivation: transformation products (tps) of man-made chemicals, formed through microbially mediated transformation in the environment, can have serious adverse environmental effects, yet the analytical identification of tps is challenging. rule-based prediction tools are successful in predicting tps, especially in environmental chemistry applications that typically have to rely on small datasets, by imparting the existing knowledge on enzyme-mediated biotransformation reactions. however, the rules extracted from biotransformation reaction databases usually face the issue of being over/under-generalized and are not flexible to be updated with new reactions. results: we developed an automatic rule extraction tool called envirule. it clusters biotransformation reactions into different groups based on the similarities of reaction fingerprints, and then automatically extracts and generalizes rules for each reaction group in smarts format. it optimizes the genericity of automatic rules against the downstream tp prediction task. models trained with automatic rules outperformed the models trained with manually curated rules by 30% in the area under curve (auc) scores. moreover, automatic rules can be easily updated with new reactions, highlighting envirule's strengths for both automatic extraction of optimized reactions rules and automated updating thereof. availability and implementation: envirule code is freely available at https://github.com/zhangky12/envirule.",AB_0515
"eutriconodonta is a diverse group of crown mammals that are known from the jurassic and cretaceous, mainly on the northern landmasses. here we report a single lower molariform from the intertrappean deposits exposed near anjar, in the kutch district of the state of gujarat, india that date to the last 259,000 years of the cretaceous. the lower molariform of this new genus of eutriconodontan is relatively large, has three subequal, erect, lanceolated cusps, and lacks both a buccal and lingual cingulum, accessory cusps (d, e), and a vertical groove mesial to cusp b. it represents the first eutriconodontan mammal from the cretaceous of india and the late cretaceous of gondwana, and is the globally youngest record of this group. the results of a cladistic analysis support placement of the new indian taxon among the eutriconodonta, possibly more closely allied to triconodontids than to other groups. this new genus of eutriconodontan is the tenth named mammalian species known from the late cretaceous of india and the first relatively large-bodied faunivore. this record shows that the eutriconodonta had a broader temporal and geographic distribution than previously thought and highlights the importance of continued paleontological exploration on the indian subcontinent.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:84d96471-e733-420b-9fa2-f41bc4b62e4b",AB_0515
"in many parts of the globe, heart disease or cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality. it is a group of conditions that includes heart failure and other cardiac problems. in the usa, there are an estimated 356,000 cases of hospital cardiac arrest every year, 90% of which are fatal, as reported by the american heart association (tsao et al. in circulation https:// doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000001052, 2022). however, the survival rate may be improved by routine monitoring of cardiac function in order to detect the illness at an early stage. many formerly intractable medical issues have made significant progress because of the combination of computer technology and biomedical research. automatic prediction is made possible by the examination of previously learned data in machine learning. in this research, we utilize the physionet cinc/c challenge 2016 phonocardiogram dataset. classification models like k-nearest neighbour (knn), support vector machine (svm), and alexnet are used with the features retrieved using wavelet scattering transform and continuous wavelet transform. the primary objective of this work is to provide a very effective method for early diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders, which will help clinical professionals better spot heart issues in their patients. sensitivity, specificity and other performance metrics are used to assess the effectiveness of the various categorization models. knn, svm, and alexnet classifiers all achieve good accuracy with alexnet outperforms the former two giving an accuracy of 98.11%, with a sensitivity of 96.20% and a specificity of 98.73%. our suggested model's output has the potential to contribute significantly to the categorization of cardiac sounds.",AB_0515
"continuity, correctness, and completeness of genome assemblies are important for many biological projects. long reads represent a major driver towards delivering high-quality genomes, but not everybody can achieve the necessary coverage for good long read-only assemblies. therefore, improving existing assemblies with low-coverage long reads is a promising alternative. the improvements include correction, scaffolding, and gap filling. however, most tools perform only one of these tasks and the useful information of reads that supported the scaffolding is lost when running separate programs successively. therefore, we propose a new tool for combined execution of all three tasks using pacbio or oxford nanopore reads. gapless is available at: https://github.com/schmeing/gapless.",AB_0515

"amaranth (amaranthus l.) is native to mexico and north america, where it was cultivated thousands of years ago, but now amaranth is grown worldwide. amaranth is one of the most promising food crops with high nutritional value and belongs to the family amaranthaceae. the high-quality genome assembly of cultivated amaranth species (a. hypochondriacus, a. cruentus) and wild/weedy species (a. tuberculatus, a. hybridus, and a. palmeri) has already been reported; therefore, we developed an amaranth genomic resource database (agrdb) to provide access to all the genomic information such as genes, ssrs, snps, tfs, mirnas, and transporters in one place. the agrdb database contains functionally annotated gene information with their sequence details, genic as well as genomic ssrs with their three sets of primers, transcription factors classified into different families with their sequence information and annotation details, putative mirnas with their family, sequences, and targeted gene details, transporter genes with their superfamily, trans-membrane domain details, and details of genic as well as nongenic snps with 3' and 5' flanking sequence information of five amaranth species. a database search can be performed using the gene id, sequence id, sequence motif, motif repeat, family name, annotation keyword, scaffold or chromosome numbers, etc. this resource also includes some useful tools, including jbrowse for the visualization of genes, ssrs, snps, and tfs on the respective amaranth genomes and blast search to perform a blast search of the user's query sequence against the amaranth genome as well as protein sequences. the agrdb database will serve as a potential platform for genetic improvement and characterization of this futuristic crop. the agrdb database will be accessible via the link: http://www.nbpgr.ernet.in:8080/amaranthgrd/.",AB_0515
"operons are groups of consecutive genes that transcribe together under the regulation of a common promoter. they influence protein regulation and various physiological pathways, making their accurate detection desirable. the detection of operons through experimental means is a laborious and financially intensive process. therefore, human experts predict potential operons utilizing their prior knowledge of the genetic organization and functional correlation of the genes. however, with the rise in the number of completely sequenced genomes, the development of automated algorithms, tools, and web servers is highly preferred over manual detection for operon prediction. currently available state-of-the-art algorithms use a deep learning-based model to predict if the adjacent genes belong to the same operons in the given genome. however, these require an understanding of programming knowledge and computational skills, making them not-very user friendly. in this study, we developed a user-friendly web service, operon finder, for on-the-fly prediction of operons using the deep learning method. the interface provides a facility for genome search, operon live-filtering, viewing operonic dna sequences, downloading predicted results, and links for data retrieval from the ncbi (national center for biotechnology information) database. the web server is available at https://www.iitg.ac.in/spkanaujia/operonfinder.html. the experimental methods and the implementation details are publicly available at https://github.com/ spklab/operon-finder.(c) 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0515
"biofilms are one of the leading causes of antibiotic resistance. it acts as a physical barrier against the human immune system and drugs. the use of anti-biofilm agents helps in tackling the menace of antibiotic resistance. the identification of efficient anti-biofilm chemicals remains a challenge. therefore, in this study, we developed 'anti-biofilm', a machine learning technique (mlt) based predictive algorithm for identifying and analyzing the biofilm inhibition of small molecules. the algorithm is developed using exper-imentally validated anti-biofilm compounds with half maximal inhibitory concentration (ic50) values extracted from abiofilm resource. out of the five mlts, the support vector machine performed best with pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.75 on the training/testing data set. the robustness of the developed model was further checked using an independent validation dataset. while analyzing the chemical diver-sity of the anti-biofilm compounds, we observed that they occupy diverse chemical spaces with parent molecules like furanone, urea, phenolic acids, quinolines, and many more. use of diverse chemicals as input further signifies the robustness of our predictive models. the three best-performing machine learn-ing models were implemented as a user-friendly 'anti-biofilm' web server (https://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/ma-nojk/antibiofilm/) with different other modules which make 'anti-biofilm' a comprehensive platform. therefore, we hope that our initiative will be helpful for the scientific community engaged in identifying effective anti-biofilm agents to target the problem of antimicrobial resistance.& copy; 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0515
"membrane protein complexes are crucial for a large variety of biological functions which are mainly dictated by their binding affinity. due to the intricate nature of their structure, however, the binding affinity of membrane proteins is less explored compared to globular proteins. mutations in these complexes affect their binding affinity, as well as impair critical functions, and may lead to diseases. although experimental binding affinity data have expanded in the literature, they are dispersed and it is necessary to compile them into a reliable and comprehensive database. hence, we developed mpad (membrane protein complex binding affinity database), which contains experimental binding affinities of membrane protein- protein complexes and their mutants along with sequence, structure, and functional information, membrane-specific features, experimental conditions, as well as literature information. mpad has an easy-to-use interface and options to build search queries, display, sort, download, and upload the data are among the other features available to users. this database can be used to understand the factors influencing the binding affinity in membrane proteins when compared to globular proteins as well as the impact of mutations on binding affinity, which may have potential applications to structure-based drug design. mpad can be freely accessed at https://web.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo2/mpad. & copy; 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0515
