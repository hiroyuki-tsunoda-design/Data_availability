"hypnotizability is a stable trait that moderates the benefit of hypnosis for treating pain, but limited availability of hypnotizability testing deters widespread use of hypnosis. inexpensive genotyping of four single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the catechol-o-methyltransferase (comt) gene was performed using giant magnetoresistive biosensors to determine if hypnotizable individuals can be identified for targeted hypnosis referrals. for individuals with the proposed optimal comt diplotypes, 89.5% score highly on the hypnotic induction profile (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% ci, 1.26-28.75), which identified 40.5% of the treatable population. mean hypnotizability scores of the optimal group were significantly higher than the total population (p = 0.015; effect size = 0.60), an effect that was present in women (p = 0.0015; effect size = 0.83), but not in men (p = 0.28). in an exploratory cohort, optimal individuals also reported significantly higher postoperative pain scores (p = 0.00030; effect size = 1.93), indicating a greater need for treatment.

"background: chronic stress alters reward sensitivity and contributes to the emergence of anhedonia. in clinical samples, the perception of stress is a strong predictor of anhedonia. while there is substantial evidence demonstrating psychotherapy reduces perceived stress, little is known regarding the effects of treatment-related decreases in perceived stress on anhedonia. methods: the current study investigated reciprocal relations between perceived stress and anhedonia using a cross-lagged panel model approach in a 15-week clinical trial examining the effects of behavioral activation treatment for anhedonia (bata), a novel psychotherapy to treat anhedonia, compared to a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (mbct) comparison intervention (clinicaltrials.gov identifiers nct02874534 and nct04036136). results: treatment completers (n = 72) experienced significant reductions in anhedonia (m=-8.94, sd = 5.66) on the snaith-hamilton pleasure scale (t(71) = 13.39, p < .0001), and significant reductions in perceived stress (m =-3.71, sd = 3.88) on the perceived stress scale (t(71) = 8.11, p < .0001) following treatment. across all treatment-seeking participants (n = 87), a longitudinal autoregressive cross-lagged model revealed significant paths showing that higher levels of perceived stress at treatment week 1 predicted reductions in anhedonia at treatment week 4; lower levels of perceived stress at week 8 predicted reductions in anhedonia at week 12. anhedonia did not significantly predict perceived stress at any stage of treatment. conclusions: this study showed specific timing and directional effects of perceived stress on anhedonia during psychotherapy treatment. individuals with relatively high perceived stress at the start of treatment were more likely to report relatively lower anhedonia a few weeks into treatment. at mid-treatment, individuals with low perceived stress were more likely to report lower anhedonia towards the end of treatment. these results demonstrate that early treatment components reduce perceived stress, thus allowing for downstream changes in hedonic functioning during mid-late treatment. the findings presented here suggest it will be critically important for future clinical trials evaluating novel interventions for anhedonia to measure stress levels repeatedly, as an important mechanism of change. trial name: development of a novel transdiagnostic intervention for anhedonia -r61 phase. trial url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct02874534. trial registration number: nct02874534.",AB_0587
"introduction: reasoning is a complex form of human cognition whose nature has long been debated. while a number of neurocognitive mechanisms for deductive reasoning have been offered, one of the most prominent accounts is mental model theory (mmt). according to mmt, humans are able to manipulate and represent information for reasoning and problem solving by leveraging the brain's evolved visuospatial resources. thus, when solving deductive reasoning problems, reasoners build mental models of the essential pieces of information conveyed in the premises, with their relations to each other represented spatially-even when the information contained within a reasoning problem is not intrinsically spatial. crucially, taking a spatially-based approach, such as building mental models, supports higher accuracy on deductive reasoning problems. however, no study has empirically tested whether explicitly training this mental modeling ability leads to improved deductive reasoning performance.method: therefore, we designed the mental models training app, a cognitive training mobile application which requires participants to complete increasingly difficult reasoning problems while using an external mental modeling tool. in this preregistered study (https://osf.io/4b7kn), we conducted a between-subjects experiment (n = 301) which compared the mental models training app to 3 distinct control conditions in order to examine which specific components (if any) of the training were causally responsible for improved reasoning performance.results: results demonstrate that, when compared to a passive control condition, the mental models training app led to improvements in adults' verbal deductive reasoning performance both during and after the training intervention. however, contrary to our preregistered hypotheses, the training-induced improvements were not significantly larger than the effects of the active control conditions- one which included adaptive practice of the reasoning problems, and one which included adaptive practice as well as a spatial alphabetization control task.discussion: therefore, while the present results demonstrate the ability of the mental models training app to enhance verbal deductive reasoning, they do not support the hypothesis that directly training participants mental modeling ability yields improved performance beyond the effects of adaptive practice of reasoning. future research should examine the long-term effects of repeated usage of the mental models training app, as well as transfer effects to other forms of reasoning. finally, we present the mental models training app as a free mobile application available on the apple app store (https://apps.apple.com/us/ app/mental-models-training/id1664939931), in the hope that this translational research may be utilized by the general public to improve their reasoning ability.",AB_0587
"correlations in observational studies are commonly misinterpreted as causation. although correlation is necessary to establish a causal relationship between two variables, correlations may also arise due to chance, reverse causality, or confounding. there are several methods available to orthopaedic researchers to determine whether the observed correlations are causal. these methods depend on the key components of the study including, but not limited to, study design and data availability on confounders. in this article, we illustrate the main concepts surrounding correlation and causation using intuitive real-world examples from the orthopaedic literature. please visit the following https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=ww7pfudzbha&t=52s for a video that explains the highlights of the paper in practical terms.

"many studies in arthroplasty research are based on nonrandomized, retrospective, registry-based co-horts. in these types of studies, patients belonging to different treatment or exposure groups often differ with respect to patient characteristics, medical histories, surgical indications, or other factors. conse-quently, comparisons of nonrandomized groups are often subject to treatment selection bias and con-founding. propensity scores can be used to balance cohort characteristics, thus helping to minimize potential bias and confounding. this article explains how propensity scores are created and describes multiple ways in which they can be applied in the analysis of nonrandomized studies. please visit the following (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqgxl_nzws4&t=3s) for a video that explains the highlights of the paper in practical terms.(c) 2022 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.",AB_0587
"prediction models are common in medicine for predicting outcomes such as mortality, complications, or response to treatment. despite the growing interest in these models in arthroplasty (and orthopaedics in general), few have been adopted in clinical practice. if robustly built and validated, prediction models can be excellent tools to support surgical decision making. in this paper, we provide an overview of the statistical concepts surrounding prediction models and outline practical steps for prediction model development and validation in arthroplasty research. please visit the following https://www.youtube. com/watch?v1/49yrit23rkic for a video that explains the highlights of the paper in practical terms.(c) 2022 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.",AB_0587
"recent advances in deep learning have greatly improved the ability to generate analysis models from medical images. in particular, great attention is focused on quickly generating models of the left ventricle from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cmri) to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of millions of patients. however, even state-of-the art frameworks present challenges, such as discontinuities of the cardiac tissue and excessive jaggedness along the myocardial walls. these geometrical features are often anatomically incorrect and may lead to unrealistic results once the geometrical models are employed in computational analyses. in this work, we propose an anatomically-guided deep learning model to overcome these limitations while preserving the advantages of state-of-the-art frameworks, such as computational efficiency, robustness, and generalization capabilities. our novel anatomically-guided neural networks are formed by a unet followed by a b-spline head, which acts as a regularization layer during training. the b-spline head aggregates the prediction into a single connected region, removes any undesired tissue islands, and produces a smooth continuous contour. in addition, the introduction of the b-spline head contributes to achieve a robust uncertainty quantification of the left ventricle inner and outer walls. our results show that the proposed model generates anatomically consistent geometries while achieving an agreement with the ground truth images comparable to state-of-the-art frameworks and simultaneously improving the geometry uncertainty quantification in comparison to classic unet models. the examples presented here, as well as source codes, are all open-source under the github repository https://github.com/cbl-ucf/unet_ag.",AB_0587
"optical neural networks (onns) are promising hardware platforms for next-generation artificial intelligence acceleration with ultrafast speed and low-energy consumption. however, previous onn designs are bounded by one multiply-accumulate operation per device, showing unsatisfying scalability. in this work, we propose a scalable onn architecture, dubbed squeezelight. we propose a nonlinear optical neuron based on multioperand ring resonators (morrs) to squeeze vector dot-product into a single device with low wavelength usage and built-in nonlinearity. a block-level squeezing technique with structured sparsity is exploited to support higher scalability. we adopt a robustness-aware training algorithm to guarantee variation tolerance. to enable a truly scalable onn architecture, we extend squeezelight to a separable optical cnn architecture that further squeezes in the layer level. two orthogonal convolutional layers are mapped to one morr array, leading to order-of-magnitude higher software training scalability. we further explore augmented representability for squeezelight by introducing parametric morr neurons with trainable nonlinearity, together with a nonlinearity-aware initialization method to stabilize convergence. experimental results show that squeezelight achieves one-order-of-magnitude better compactness and efficiency than previous designs with high fidelity, trainability, and robustness. our open-source codes are available at https://github.com/jeremiemelo/squeezelight.",AB_0587
"despite the great success of high-level synthesis (hls) tools, we observe several unresolved challenges: 1) the high-level abstraction of hls programming styles sometimes conceals optimization opportunities; 2) the actual quality of resulting rtl designs is hard to predict; and 3) existing hls tools do not provide flexible tradeoff (pareto) solutions among different objectives and constraints. to this end, we propose an end-to-end framework, namely, ironman-pro. the primary goal is to enable a flexible and automated design space exploration (dse), to provide either optimized solutions under user-specified constraints or pareto tradeoffs among different objectives (such as resource types, area, and latency). ironman-pro consists of three components: 1) gpp, a highly accurate graph-neural-network-based performance and resource predictor; 2) rlmd, a reinforcement-learning-based multiobjective design exploration engine for optimal resource allocation strategies, aiming to provide pareto solutions among different objectives; and 3) ct, a code transformer to assist rlmd and gpp, which extracts the data flow graphs from original hls c/c++ and automatically generates synthesizable code with optimized hls directives. experimental results show that, 1) gpp achieves high prediction accuracy, reducing the prediction errors of hls tools by 10.9 x in resource utilization and 5.7x in critical path (cp) timing; 2) compared with meta-heuristic-based techniques, ironman-pro generates superior solutions improving resource utilization by 16.0% similar to 29.5% and cp timing by 7.6%-16.5%; and 3) under user-specified constraints, ironman-pro can find satisfying solutions over 96% of the cases, more than twice as many as that of meta-heuristic-based techniques and with a speedup of up to $400\times $ . this work demonstrates the great potential of applying machine learning algorithms in the electronic design automation domain, especially for the hard-to-solve problems, such as timing estimation and optimization. ironman-pro is available at https://github.com/lydiawunan/ironman.",AB_0587
