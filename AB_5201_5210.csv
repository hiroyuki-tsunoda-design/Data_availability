"human aromatase enzyme is a microsomal cytochrome p450 and catalyzes aromatization of androgens into estrogens during steroidogenesis. for breast cancer therapy, third -generation aromatase inhibitors (ais) have proven to be effective; however patients acquire resistance to current ais. thus there is a need to predict aromatase-related proteins to develop efficacious ais. a machine learning method was established to identify aromatase-related proteins using a five-fold cross validation technique. in this study, different svm approach based models were built using the following approaches like amino acid, dipeptide composition, hybrid and evolutionary profiles in the form of position-specific scoring matrix (pssm); with maximum accuracy of 87.42%, 84.05%, 85.12%, and 92.02% respectively. based on the primary sequence, the developed method is highly accurate to predict the aromataserelated proteins. prediction scores graphs were developed using the known dataset to check the performance of the method. based on the approach described above, a webserver for predicting aromatase-related proteins from primary sequence data was developed and implemented at https://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/servers/muthu/aromatase/home.html. we hope that the developed method will be useful for aromatase protein related research.",AB_0521
"aims/hypothesis while autoantibodies are traditional markers for type 1 diabetes development, we identified gut microbial biomarkers in 1-year-old infants associated with future type 1 diabetes up to 20 years before diagnosis. methods infants enrolled in the longitudinal general population cohort all babies in southeast sweden (abis) provided a stool sample at a mean age of 12.5 months. samples (future type 1 diabetes, n=16; healthy controls, n=268) were subjected to 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) sequencing and quantitative pcr. microbial differences at the taxonomic and core microbiome levels were assessed. picrust was used to predict functional content from the 16s rrna amplicons. sixteen infants, with a future diagnosis of type 1 diabetes at a mean age of 13.3 +/- 5.4 years, and one hundred iterations of 32 matched control infants, who remained healthy up to 20 years of age, were analysed. results parasutterella and eubacterium were more abundant in healthy control infants, while porphyromonas was differentially more abundant in infants with future type 1 diabetes diagnosis. ruminococcus was a strong determinant in differentiating both control infants and those with future type 1 diabetes using random forest analysis and had differing trends of abundance when comparing control infants and those with future type 1 diabetes. flavonifractor and uba1819 were the strongest factors for differentiating control infants, showing higher abundance in control infants compared with those with future type 1 diabetes. alternatively, alistipes (more abundant in control infants) and fusicatenibacter (mixed abundance patterns when comparing case and control infants) were the strongest factors for differentiating future type 1 diabetes. predicted gene content regarding butyrate production and pyruvate fermentation was differentially observed to be higher in healthy control infants. conclusions/interpretation this investigation suggests that microbial biomarkers for type 1 diabetes may be present as early as 1 year of age, as reflected in the taxonomic and functional differences of the microbial communities. the possibility of preventing disease onset by altering or promoting a healthy' gut microbiome is appealing. data availability the forward and reverse 16s raw sequencing data generated in this study are available through the ncbi sequence read archive under bioproject prjna875929. associated sample metadata used for statistical comparison are available in the source data file. r codes used for statistical comparisons and figure generation are available at: https://github.com/pmilletich/t1d_pipeline.",AB_0521
"human actions being diverse in nature cannot be generalized, thus making it quite difficult to train a machine to recognize such diversified actions. this challenge is further compounded by the lack of avail-ability of datasets for aerial surveillance, as collecting and annotating a large dataset is a formidable task. this paper aims to solve the problem of data scarcity by introducing a new dataset, aeriform in-action for recognizing human actions from aerial videos. the proposed dataset consists of 32 high-resolution videos containing 13 action classes with 55,477 frames (without augmentation) and almost 40 0,0 0 0 an-notations. it includes complex and aggressive actions such as kicking and punching, as well as drone signaling actions like waving and handshaking. the dataset also includes human-object interactions like carrying and reading. in addition to the dataset, this paper also presents a two-step deep learning frame-work for recognizing human actions based on the integration of human detection and action recognition module. the action recognition module adopts a modified version of the resnext101 architecture (m-resnext101) to recognize human actions in aerial videos. the performance of the proposed m-resnext101 model is compared with 13 other deep learning models, and it outperforms all of them with an accuracy of 76.44% on the test data. the proposed dataset for human action recognition in aerial videos is available on https://surbhi-31.github.io/aeriform-in-action/.

"phage therapy is a viable alternative to antibiotics for treating microbial infections, particularly managing drug-resistant strains of bacteria. one of the major challenges in designing phage-based therapy is to identify the most appropriate potential phage candidate to treat bacterial infections. in this study, an attempt has been made to predict phage-host interactions with high accuracy to identify the potential bacteriophage that can be used for treating a bacterial infection. the developed models have been created using a training dataset containing 826 phage-host interactions, and have been evaluated on a validation dataset comprising 1,201 phage-host interactions. firstly, alignment-based models have been developed using similarity between phage-phage (blastphage), host-host (blasthost) and phage-crispr (crisprpred), where we achieved accuracy between 42.4-66.2% for blastphage, 55-78.4% for blasthost, and 43.7-80.2% for crisprpred across five taxonomic levels. secondly, alignment free models have been developed using machine learning techniques. thirdly, hybrid models have been developed by integrating the alignment-free models and the similarity-scores where we achieved maximum performance of (60.6-93.5%). finally, an ensemble model has been developed that combines the hybrid and alignment-based models. our ensemble model achieved highest accuracy of 67.9, 80.6, 85.5, 90, and 93.5% at genus, family, order, class, and phylum levels on validation dataset. in order to serve the scientific community, we have also developed a webserver named phagetb and provided a standalone software package (https:// webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/phagetb/) for the same.",AB_0521
"background illumina sequencing platform requires base diversity in the initial 11 cycles for efficient cluster identification and colour matrix estimation. this limitation yields low-quality data for amplicon libraries having homogeneous base composition. spike-in of phix library ensures base diversity but reduces the overall number of sequencing reads for data analysis. to overcome such low diversity issues during amplicon sequencing on illumina platforms, we developed a high throughput single amplicon sequencing method by introducing `n' (0-10) spacers in target gene amplification primers that are pooled for simple handling. result we evaluated the efficiency of 'n' (0-10) spacer-linked primers by targeting bacterial 16s v3-v4 region, demonstrating heterogeneous base library construction. the addition of 'n' (0-10) spacers causes sequencing frameshift at every base that leads to base diversity and produces heterogeneous high quality reads within a single amplicon library. we have written a python based command-line software,metretrim, to trim the 'n' (0-10) spacers from the raw reads (https://github.com/mohak91/metretrim). we further demonstrated the accuracy of this method by comparative mock community analysis with standard illumina v3-v4 primer method. the zymobiomicst microbial community dna standard was used as a control for this study. we performed data analysisusing the dada2 pipeline where taxonomy was assigned using silva database as reference. we observed no difference between the communities represented by our method and standard illumina v3-v4 primer method. conclusion this method eliminates the need for phix spike-in for single amplicon sequencing on illumina miseq platform. this allows for sequencing of more number of samples in a run and a reduction in the overall cost. given that illumina sequencing works on sbs chemistry irrespective of the platform (such as hiseq, miseq, nextseq, novaseq, etc.) we propose that this strategy of using 'n' (0-10) spacer-linked primer design can be adopted for generating high-quality single locus amplicon sequencing in a high throughput manner across the illumina platform subject to further validation.",AB_0521
"in today's era, one of the important applications of artificial intelligence (ai) is human activity recognition (har). it has a wide range of applicability in health monitoring for patients with chronic diseases, gaming consoles for gesture recognition, etc. sensor-based har systems use signals collected over a period of time to label an activity. when we design an efficient sensor-based har system, a model requires learning an optimal association of spatial and temporal features. in this article, we propose a sensor-based har technique using the deep learning approach. we present a deep reverse transformer-based attention mechanism to guide the side residual features unlike the conventional bottom-up approaches for feature fusion, we exploit a top-down feature fusion approach. the reverse attention is self-calibrated throughout the course of learning, which regularizes the attention modules and dynamically adjusts the learning rate. the overall framework outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and is shown to be statistically significant against these methods on five publicly available sensor-based har datasets, namely, mhealth, usc-had, wharf, utd-mhad1, and utd-mhad2. further, we conduct an ablation study to showcase the importance of each of the components of the proposed framework. source code of this work is available at https://github.com/rishavpramanik/ revtransformerattentionhar.",AB_0521
"mass spectrometry is widely used for quantitative proteomics studies, relative protein quantification, and differential expression analysis of proteins. there is a large variety of quantification software and analysis tools. nevertheless, there is a need for a modular, easy-to-use application programming interface in r that transparently supports a variety of well principled statistical procedures to make applying them to proteomics data, comparing and understanding their differences easy. the prolfqua package integrates essential steps of the mass spectrometry-based differential expression analysis workflow: quality control, data normalization, protein aggregation, statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and sample size estimation. the package makes integrating new data formats easy. it can be used to model simple experimental designs with a single explanatory variable and complex experiments with multiple factors and hypothesis testing. the implemented methods allow sensitive and specific differential expression analysis. furthermore, the package implements benchmark functionality that can help to compare data acquisition, data preprocessing, or data modeling methods using a gold standard data set. the application programmer interface of prolfqua strives to be clear, predictable, discoverable, and consistent to make proteomics data analysis application development easy and exciting. finally, the prolfqua r-package is available on github https://github.com/fgcz/ prolfqua, distributed under the mit license. it runs on all platforms supported by the r free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.",AB_0521
"discovering pre-micrornas (mirnas) is the core of mirna discovery. using traditional sequence/structural features, many tools have been published to discover mirnas. however, in practical applications like genomic annotations, their actual performance has been very low. this becomes more grave in plants where unlike animals pre-mirnas are much more complex and difficult to identify. a huge gap exists between animals and plants for the available software for mirna discovery and species-specific mirna information. here, we present miwords, a composite deep learning system of transformers and convolutional neural networks which sees genome as a pool of sentences made of words with specific occurrence preferences and contexts, to accurately identify pre-mirna regions across plant genomes. a comprehensive benchmarking was done involving > 10 software representing different genre and many experimentally validated datasets. miwords emerged as the best one while breaching accuracy of 98% and performance lead of similar to 10%. miwords was also evaluated across arabidopsis genome where also it outperformed the compared tools. as a demonstration, miwords was run across the tea genome, reporting 803 pre-mirna regions, all validated by small rna-seq reads from multiple samples, and most of them were functionally supported by the degradome sequencing data. miwords is freely available as stand-alone source codes at https://scbb.ihbt.res.in/miwords/index.php.",AB_0521
"graph neural networks (gnn) uphold the essence of irregularly structured information embedded in a graph via message passing among the nodes and aggregating the node features at various levels of the graph. in the past, researchers have extensively used the gnn models for several semi-supervised node classification tasks. existing gnn models do not use nodes' information sufficiently. the use of inter-node feature-level correlational information with the existing gnn models might lead to more powerful learning models. here, a weighting scheme has been developed for message passing and aggregation functions. this model has been named vector gnn, or in short, vecgnn, due to its relationship with vector space. vecgnn takes into consideration the relative position of a node with respect to its neighboring nodes in the feature space, which influences the weight of features passed to the information aggregation phase. these weights are assigned using two different statistical measures: jaccard's coefficient and cosine similarity. the proposed weighting scheme uses a generalized approach that can be easily incorporated into several gnn frameworks. vecgnn is evaluated using three citation datasets: citeseer, pubmed, and cora. on these datasets, three sets of experiments have been conducted with varying numbers of training and testing nodes. we have used training, validation, and test set nodes with ratios of 1:1:8, 2:1:7, and 3:1:6. experimenting on these, we observe an improvement of 2%-4% over the baseline models: graph convolution network (gcn), graph attention network (gat), and jumping knowledge networks (jknets). the source code is available at the link https://github.com/sourodeeproy/vecgnn.",AB_0521
"background pancreatic surgery is rapidly transitioning towards minimally invasive methods. positive results have been published regarding the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, but postoperative quality of life after operation remains relatively unexplored. the aim of this study was to assess the long-term quality of life after open versus laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy.methods a long-term analysis of quality-of-life data after laparoscopic and open distal pancreatectomy based on the lapop trial (a single-centre, superiority, parallel, open-label, rct in which patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy were randomized 1 : 1 to either the open or laparoscopic approach). patients received the quality-of-life questionnaires qlq-c30 and pan26 before surgery and at 5-6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after surgery.results between september 2015 and february 2019, a total of 60 patients were randomized, and 54 patients (26 in the open group and 28 in the laparoscopic group) were included in the quality-of-life analysis. a significant difference was observed in six domains in the mixed model analysis, with better results among patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery. at the 2-year measurement, a statistically significant difference between groups was seen in three domains, and a clinically relevant difference of 10 or more was seen in 16 domains, with better results among the patients who underwent laparoscopic resection.conclusion considerable differences were shown in postoperative quality of life after laparoscopic compared with open distal pancreatectomy, with better results among the patients who had undergone laparoscopic resection. of note, some of these differences persisted up to 2 years after surgery. these results strengthen the ongoing transition from open to minimally invasive pancreatic surgery for distal pancreatectomy. registration number: isrctn26912858 (http://www.controlled-trials.com).",AB_0521
