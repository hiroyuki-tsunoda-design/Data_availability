"in precision agriculture, non-invasive remote sensing can be used to observe crops and weeds in visible and non-visible spectra. this paper proposes a novel approach for weed mapping using lightweight vision transformers. the method uses a lightweight transformer architecture to process high-resolution aerial images obtained from drones and performs semantic segmentation to distinguish between crops and weeds. the method also employs specific architectural designs to enable transfer learning from rgb weights in a multispectral setting. for this purpose, the weedmap dataset, acquired by drones equipped with multispectral cameras, was used. the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding the state-of-the-art. our approach also enables more efficient mapping, allowing farmers to quickly and easily identify infested areas and prioritize their control efforts. these results encourage using drones as versatile computer vision flying devices for herbicide management, thereby improving crop yields. the code is available at https://github.com/pasqualedem/lwvits-for-weedmapping.",AB_0546
"background: acute resection for left-sided obstructive colon carcinoma is thought to be associated with a higher mortality risk than a bridge-to-surgery approach using decompressing stoma or self-expandable metal stent, but prediction models are lacking. objective:this study aimed to determine the influence of treatment strategy on mortality within 90 days from the first intervention in patients presenting with left-sided obstructive colon carcinoma. design:this was a national multicenter cohort study that used data from a prospective national audit. settings:the study was performed in 75 dutch hospitals. patients:patients were included if they underwent resection with curative intent for left-sided obstructive colon carcinoma between 2009 and 2016. interventions:first intervention was either acute resection, bridge to surgery with self-expandable metallic stent, or bridge to surgery with decompressing stoma. main outcome measures:the main outcome measure was 90-day mortality after the first intervention. risk factors were identified using multivariable logistic analysis. subsequently, a risk model was developed. results:in total, 2395 patients were included, with the first intervention consisting of acute resection in 1848 patients (77%), stoma as bridge to surgery in 332 patients (14%), and stent as bridge to surgery in 215 patients (9%). overall, 152 patients (6.3%) died within 90 days from the first intervention. a decompressing stoma was independently associated with lower 90-day mortality risk (hr, 0.27; 95% ci, 0.094-0.62). other independent predictors for mortality were age, asa classification, tumor location, and index levels of serum creatinine and c-reactive protein. the constructed risk model had an area under the curve of 0.84 (95% ci, 0.81-0.87). limitations:only patients who underwent surgical resection were included. conclusions:treatment strategy had a significant impact on 90-day mortality. a decompressing stoma considerably lowers the risk of mortality, especially in older and frail patients. the developed risk model needs further external validation. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b975.",AB_0546
"background:evidence of efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) for stroke recovery is hampered by an unexplained variability of reported effect sizes and an insufficient understanding of mechanisms of action. we aimed to (1) briefly summarize evidence of efficacy, (2) identify critical factors to explain the reported variation in effects, and (3) provide mechanism-based recommendations for future trials.methods:we performed a systematic review of the literature according to cochrane and prisma protocols. we included trials with & ge;10 patients per treatment group. we classified outcome measures according to the international classification of functioning, disability, and health. meta-analysis was done when at least 3 trials were reported on the same construct. in case of significant summary effect sizes with significant heterogeneity, we used sensitivity analyses to test for correlations and differences between found individual effect sizes and possible effect modifiers such as patient-, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation-, and trial characteristics.results:we included 57 articles (n=2595). funnel plots showed no publication bias. we found significant effect sizes at the level of body function (upper limb synergies, muscle strength, language functioning, global cognitive functioning, visual/spatial inattention) with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation within or beyond 3 months after stroke. we also found significant effect sizes at the level of activities. we found no subgroup differences or significant correlations between individual summary effect sizes and any tested possible effect modifier.conclusions:repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation holds the potential to benefit a range of motor and cognitive outcomes after stroke, but the evidence of efficacy is challenged by unexplained heterogeneity across many small sampled trials. we propose large trials with the collection of individual patient data on baseline severity and brain network integrity with sufficiently powered subgroup analyses, as well as protocolized time-locked training of the target behavior. additional neurophysiological and biomechanical data may help in understanding mechanisms and identifying biomarkers of treatment efficacy.registration:url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: crd42022300330.",AB_0546
"ct perfusion imaging is important in the imaging workup of acute ischemic stroke for evaluating affected cerebral tissue. ct perfusion analysis software produces cerebral perfusion maps from commonly noisy spatio-temporal ct perfusion data. high levels of noise can influence the results of ct perfusion analysis, necessitating software tuning. this work proposes a novel approach for ct perfusion analysis that uses physics-informed learning, an optimization framework that is robust to noise. in particular, we propose sppinn: spatio-temporal perfusion physics-informed neural network and research spatio-temporal physics-informed learning. sppinn learns implicit neural representations of contrast attenuation in ct perfusion scans using the spatio-temporal coordinates of the data and employs these representations to estimate a continuous representation of the cerebral perfusion parameters. we validate the approach on simulated data to quantify perfusion parameter estimation performance. furthermore, we apply the method to in-house patient data and the public ischemic stroke lesion segmentation 2018 benchmark data to assess the correspondence between the perfusion maps and reference standard infarct core segmentations. our method achieves accurate perfusion parameter estimates even with high noise levels and differentiates healthy tissue from infarcted tissue. moreover, sppinn perfusion maps accurately correspond with reference standard infarct core segmentations. hence, we show that using spatio-temporal physics-informed learning for cerebral perfusion estimation is accurate, even in noisy ct perfusion data. the code for this work is available at https://github.com/lucasdevries/sppinn.",AB_0546
"cancer prevention is one of the most pressing challenges that public health needs to face. in this regard, data-driven research is central to assist medical solutions targeting cancer. to fully harness the power of data-driven research, it is imperative to have well-organized machine-readable facts into a knowledge base (kb). motivated by this urgent need, we introduce the collaborative oriented relation extraction (core) system for building kbs with limited manual annotations. core is based on the combination of distant supervision and active learning paradigms and offers a seamless, transparent, modular architecture equipped for large-scale processing. we focus on precision medicine and build the largest kb on 'fine-grained' gene expression-cancer associations-a key to complement and validate experimental data for cancer research. we show the robustness of core and discuss the usefulness of the provided kb.database url https://zenodo.org/record/7577127",AB_0546
"numerous theories and empirical studies have suggested that parents and their adolescent children reciprocally influence each other. as most studies have focused on group-level patterns, however, it remained unclear whether this was true for every family. to investigate potential heterogeneity in directionality, we applied a novel idiographic approach to examine the effects between parenting and adolescent well-being in each family separately. for 100 days, 159 dutch adolescents (mage = 13.31, 62% female) reported on affective well-being and four parenting dimensions. the family-specific effects of pre-registered (https://osf.io/7n2jx/) dynamic structural equation models indeed revealed that a reciprocal day-to-day association between parenting and adolescent affective well-being was present only in some families, with the proportion of families displaying a reciprocal association varying across the four parenting dimensions (11-55%). in other families, either parenting predicted the adolescent's affective well-being (8-43%) or vice versa (10-27%), or no day-to-day associations were found (16-60%). adolescents with higher trait levels of environmental sensitivity and neuroticism were more strongly affected by parenting. thus, findings suggest that the ways in which parents and adolescents influence each other in everyday life are unique, stressing the need to move towards an idiographic parenting science.",AB_0546
"motivation defining the full domain of protein functions belonging to an organism is a complex challenge that is due to the huge heterogeneity of the taxonomy, where single or small groups of species can bear unique functional characteristics. funtaxis-lite provides a solution to this challenge by determining taxon-based constraints on gene ontology (go) terms, which specify the functions that an organism can or cannot perform. the tool employs a set of rules to generate and spread the constraints across both the taxon hierarchy and the go graph.results the taxon-based constraints produced by funtaxis-lite extend those provided by the gene ontology consortium by an average of 300%. the implementation of these rules significantly reduces errors in function predictions made by automatic algorithms and can assist in correcting inconsistent protein annotations in databases.availability and implementation funtaxis-lite is available on https://www.medcomp.medicina.unipd.it/funtaxis-lite and from https://github.com/medcompunipd/funtaxis-lite.",AB_0546
"dcalign is a new alignment method able to cope with the conservation and the co-evolution signals that characterize the columns of multiple sequence alignments of homologous sequences. however, the pre-processing steps required to align a candidate sequence are computationally demanding. we show in v1.0 how to dramatically reduce the overall computing time by including an empirical prior over an informative set of variables mirroring the presence of insertions and deletions.availability and implementation dcalign v1.0 is implemented in julia and it is fully available at https://github.com/infernet-h2020/dcalign.",AB_0546
"the study of protein folding plays a crucial role in improving our understanding of protein function and of the relationship between genetics and phenotypes. in particular, understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of the folding process is important for uncovering the mechanisms behind human disorders caused by protein misfolding. to address this issue, it is essential to collect and curate experimental kinetic and thermodynamic data on protein folding. k-pro is a new database designed for collecting and storing experimental kinetic data on monomeric proteins, with a two-state folding mechanism. with 1,529 records from 62 proteins corresponding to 65 structures, k-pro contains various kinetic parameters such as the logarithm of the folding and unfolding rates, tanford's b and the / values. when available, the database also includes thermodynamic parameters associated with the kinetic data. k-pro features a user-friendly interface that allows browsing and downloading kinetic data of interest. the graphical inter-face provides a visual representation of the protein and mutants, and it is cross-linked to key databases such as pdb, uniprot, and pubmed. k-pro is open and freely accessible through https://folding.biofold. org/k-pro and supports the latest versions of popular browsers. & copy; 2023 the authors. published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://crea-tivecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0546
"the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ml) methods is becoming increasingly popular in computational toxicology and drug design; it is considered as a promising solution for assessing the safety profile of compounds, particularly in lead optimization and admet studies, and to meet the principles of the 3rs, which calls for the replacement, reduction, and refinement of animal testing. in this context, we herein present the development of venompred 2.0 (http://www.mmvsl.it/wp/venompred2/), the new and improved version of our free of charge web tool for toxicological predictions, which now represents a powerful web-based platform for multifaceted and human-interpretable in silico toxicity profiling of chemicals. venompred 2.0 presents an extended set of toxicity endpoints (androgenicity, skin irritation, eye irritation, and acute oral toxicity, in addition to the already available carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity, and estrogenicity) that can be evaluated through an exhaustive consensus prediction strategy based on multiple ml models. moreover, we also implemented a new utility based on the shapley additive explanations (shap) method that allows human interpretable toxicological profiling of small molecules, highlighting the features that strongly contribute to the toxicological predictions in order to derive structural toxicophores.",AB_0546
