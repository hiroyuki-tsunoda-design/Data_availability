"background: targeted ablation of anal canal high-grade dysplasia results in high recurrence over time. circumferential radiofrequency ablation might decrease recurrence. objective: this study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of circumferential radiofrequency ablation for anal high-grade dysplasia. design: this was a dual-center, prospective trial of circumferential radiofrequency ablation with a 1-year follow-up with longer follow-up data abstracted from medical records of study patients returning after trial for surveillance. ten participants from the identically conducted pilot circumferential radiofrequency ablation trial were included to improve sample size for longer-term analysis. settings: this study included 3 surgeons at 2 sites. patients: the study included 51 patients undergoing circumferential radiofrequency ablation for anal canal high-grade dysplasia. intervention: circumferential radiofrequency ablation of anal canal high-grade dysplasia and targeted radiofrequency ablation of recurrence. main outcome measures: the primary outcome measures were circumferential radiofrequency ablation efficacy and associated morbidity. results: fifty-one participants underwent circumferential radiofrequency ablation but 48 participants returned for 1 or more postprocedure high-resolution anoscopy and were evaluable. the mean age of participants was 43 years, most were male (94%), 33% were living with hiv, and 58% had 3 or more high-grade dysplasias treated. sixty percent had no recurrence, whereas 19% had 1 recurrence, 15% had 2 recurrences, and 6% had 3 recurrences. most recurrences (66%) developed within the first 6 months. kaplan-meier probability of recurrence combining both series was 19% at 3 months, 30% at 6 months, and approximately 40% after 6 months out to 30 months. most common morbidities were pain (85.4%) lasting for a median of 21 (range, 4-91) days and bleeding (91%) lasting for a median of 21 (range, 5-87) days. of those with pain and bleeding, 65% and 85%, respectively, described it as mild. no patients developed fistulas, stricture, or incontinence. no serious adverse events related to circumferential radiofrequency ablation occurred. having a previous recurrence was the only significant predictor of a subsequent recurrence (hr, 28.53) for recurrence at 9 months or before. limitations: enrollment ended prematurely, 10 participants from the pilot study were combined to increase the sample size, and longer-term follow-up was collected retrospectively were the limitations of this study. conclusions: circumferential radiofrequency ablation has improved efficacy over targeted ablation but with increased pain and bleeding. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b973.",AB_0582
"prior studies have extensively shown that the discrete slip-link model (dsm) accurately predicts the linear and nonlinear rheology of various entangled polymer systems. the only publicly available implementation of the dsm algorithm is written in the cuda c++ programming language. in this work we discuss the implementation of the fixed slip-link model and the clustered fixed slip-link model in python. our work shows that python can also utilize gpus for fast quantitative rheological predictions. our simulation code, named pydsm, allows an easy-to-read and beginner-friendly approach for users wanting to utilize the efficiency of gpu computing while also enabling an open-source python package that can easily couple or interact with other simulation or data analysis software. we demonstrate pydsm's versatility by implementing munch, a recently published algorithm that allows estimation of the statistical uncertainty in the autocorrelations for any time series data, properly accounting for the correlation in the data. an on-the-fly version of munch is applied to calculate the uncertainty in the relaxation modulus and the chain center-of-mass mean squared displacement. moreover, the uncertainty quantification in the relaxation modulus allows propagation of error through a multi-mode maxwell fit to determine the uncertainty in the dynamic modulus. lastly, as an example of a novel application of the pydsm code we calculate the re-entanglement dynamics after cessation of flow which are fundamental to the weld quality in fused-filament 3d printing. program summary program title: pydsm - discrete slip-link model (dsm) in python for fast quantitative rheology predictions of entangled polymers cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /v828b9cjp9 .1 developer's repository link: https://github .com /jgethier /pydsm licensing provisions: gplv3 programming language: python nature of problem: predicting stress relaxation in entangled polymer systems is crucial for understanding the macroscopic properties of the material. many existing models do not capture the physics of polymer entanglements in linear, star-branched, and other entangled polymeric systems. the discrete slip-link model has been shown to predict quantitatively the rheological behavior of polymers, but only one version of the model is publicly available using cuda c++ programming. solution method: we implement a less-detailed version of the discrete-slip link model to predict the linear and nonlinear rheology of entangled polymers in python. uncertainty in the predictions is implemented with the munch algorithm. we implement gpu-based calculations for fast and accurate predictions of the linear and nonlinear rheology behavior, as well as re-entanglement dynamics after cessation of flow.

"the nuclear receptor (nr) superfamily includes phylogeneticallyrelated ligand-activated proteins, which play a key role in variouscellular activities. nr proteins are subdivided into seven subfamiliesbased on their function, mechanism, and nature of the interactingligand. developing robust tools to identify nr could give insightsinto their functional relationships and involvement in disease pathways.existing nr prediction tools only use a few types of sequence-basedfeatures and are tested on relatively similar independent datasets;thus, they may suffer from overfitting when extended to new generaof sequences. to address this problem, we developed nuclear receptorprediction tool (nrpreto), a two-level nr prediction tool with a uniquetraining approach where in addition to the sequence-based featuresused by existing nr prediction tools, six additional feature groupsdepicting various physiochemical, structural, and evolutionary featuresof proteins were utilized. the first level of nrpreto allows for thesuccessful prediction of a query protein as nr or non-nr and furthersubclassifies the protein into one of the seven nr subfamilies inthe second level. we developed random forest classifiers to test onbenchmark datasets, as well as the entire human protein datasets fromrefseq and human protein reference database (hprd). we observed thatusing additional feature groups improved the performance. we alsoobserved that nrpreto achieved high performance on the external datasetsand predicted 59 novel nrs in the human proteome. the source codeof nrpreto is publicly available at https://github.com/bozdaglab/nrpreto.",AB_0582
"estimates of the annual emissions of carbon from land use, land-use change, and forestry (lulucf) are important for constructing global, regional, and national carbon budgets, which in turn help predict future rates of climate change and define potential strategies for mitigation. here, we update a long-term (1850-2020) series of annual national carbon emissions resulting from lulucf (https://doi.org/10.7910/dvn/u7ghrh, houghton and castanho, 2023), based largely, after 1960, on statistics of land use from the food and agriculture organization (fao) of the united nations (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/, fao, 2021). those data suggest that rates of deforestation in the tropics (and thus net emissions of carbon) have decreased over the last 10 years (2011-2020). the data also indicate that the net loss of tropical forest area was greater than the net gain in agricultural lands, and we explore four alternative explanations for this apparent forest conversion, one of which is shifting cultivation. we also discuss how opposing trends in recent estimates of tropical deforestation (and emissions) might be reconciled. the calculated emissions of carbon attributable to lulucf approximate the anthropogenic component of terrestrial carbon emissions, but limiting national carbon accounting to the anthropogenic component may also limit the potential for managing carbon on land.",AB_0582
"this paper introduces two new ensemble-based methods to reduce the data and computation costs of image clas-sification. they can be used with any set of classifiers and do not require additional training. in the first approach, data usage is reduced by only analyzing a full-sized image if the model has low confidence in classifying a low-resolution pixelated version. when applied on the best performing classifiers considered here, data usage is re-duced by 61.2% on mnist, 69.6% on kmnist, 56.3% on fashionmnist, 84.6% on svhn, 40.6% on imagenet, and 27.6% on imagenet-v2, all with a less than 5% reduction in accuracy. however, for cifar-10, the pixelated data are not particularly informative, and the ensemble approach increases data usage while reducing accuracy. in the second approach, compute costs are reduced by only using a complex model if a simpler model has low con-fidence in its classification. computation cost is reduced by 82.1% on mnist, 47.6% on kmnist, 72.3% on fashionmnist, 86.9% on svhn, 89.2% on imagenet, and 81.5% on imagenet-v2, all with a less than 5% reduction in accuracy; for cifar-10 the corresponding improvements are smaller at 13.5%. when cost is not an object, choosing the projection from the most confident model for each observation increases validation accuracy to 81.0% from 79.3% for imagenet and to 69.4% from 67.5% for imagenet-v2. code available at:https://github. com/carohlfs/imavis. & copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0582
"myocardial perfusion imaging (mpi) using single-photon emission computed tomography (spect) is widely applied for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. attenuation maps (mu-maps) derived from computed tomography (ct) are utilized for attenuation correction (ac) to improve the diagnostic accuracy of cardiac spect. however, in clinical practice, spect and ct scans are acquired sequentially, potentially inducing misregistration between the two images and further producing ac artifacts. conventional intensity-based registration methods show poor performance in the cross-modality registration of spect and ct-derived mu-maps since the two imaging modalities might present totally different intensity patterns. deep learning has shown great potential in medical imaging registration. however, existing deep learning strategies for medical image registration encoded the input images by simply concatenating the feature maps of different convolutional layers, which might not fully extract or fuse the input information. in addition, deep-learning -based cross-modality registration of cardiac spect and ct-derived mu-maps has not been investigated before. in this paper, we propose a novel dual-channel squeeze-fusion-excitation (dusfe) co-attention module for the cross-modality rigid registration of cardiac spect and ct-derived mu-maps. dusfe is designed based on the co-attention mechanism of two cross-connected input data streams. the channel-wise or spatial features of spect and mu-maps are jointly encoded, fused, and recalibrated in the dusfe module. dusfe can be flexibly embedded at multiple convolutional layers to enable gradual feature fusion in different spatial dimensions. our studies using clinical patient mpi studies demonstrated that the dusfe-embedded neural network generated significantly lower registration errors and more accurate ac spect images than existing methods. we also showed that the dusfe-embedded network did not over-correct or degrade the registration performance of motion-free cases. the source code of this work is available at https://github.com/xiongchaochen/dusfe_ crossregistration.",AB_0582
"the material space for catalyst discovery is expansive. volcano curves are traditionally employed to provide physical insights into optimal catalyst characteristics for new material selection. their generation lies on a single descriptor picked using expert knowledge. here we present descmap, a python-based software, to automate the selection of descriptors, the generation of volcano maps, and the identification of active sites for structure-sensitive reactions. we consider traditional energy-based and geometric descriptors for structure-sensitive reactions. descmap is integrated with the virtual kinetic laboratory (vlab) to provide multiple functionalities. it inputs spreadsheets or template files for flexibility and outputs interactive graphs for post-processing. we demonstrate its features using the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene over (111) closed-packed surfaces and the methane total oxidation over various pt facets. it can be easily applied to other complex chemistries and achieves quick screening of potential catalysts.program summary program title: descmapcpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /g399b3xyfy.1developer's repository link: https://github .com /vlachosgroup /descriptormapcode ocean capsule: https://codeocean .com /capsule /7598436 licensing provisions: mit licenseprogramming language: pythonexternal routines: pmutt, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, plotly, scikit-learn, scipy nature of problem: screening potential catalysts via microkinetic modeling and generating volcano curves is time-consuming. an automated tool to accelerate this process is lacking. solution method: python package with descriptor selection that automates descriptor-based microkinetic modeling. interactive volcano curves generated for post-analysis.(c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0582
"microkinetic modeling is invaluable for coupling microscaleatomistic data with macroscale reactor observables.we introduce an open-source microkinetic modeling (openmkm) multiscale mean-field microkineticsmodeling toolkit targeting mainly heterogeneous catalytic reactionsbut applies equally to homogeneous reactions. openmkm is a modular,object-oriented, c++ software, built on top of the robust open-sourcecantera built mainly for homogeneous reactions. reaction mechanismscan be input from human-readable files or automatic reaction generators,avoiding tedious work and errors. the governing equations are alsobuilt automatically, unlike matlab and python manual implementations,providing speed and error-free models. openmkm has built-in interfaceswith numerical software, sundials, for solving ordinary differentialequations and differential-algebraic equations. users can choose variousideal reactors and energy balance options, such as isothermal, adiabatic,temperature ramp, and an experimentally measured temperature profile.openmkm is tightly integrated with pmutt for thermochemistry inputfile generation from density functional theory (dft), streamliningthe workflow from dft to mkm and eliminating tedious work and humanerrors. it is also seamlessly integrated with the renview softwarefor visualizing the reaction pathways and performing the reactionpath or flux analysis (rpa). openmkm includes local sensitivity analysis(lsa) by solving the augmented system of equations or using the one-at-a-timefinite difference (first or second order) method. lsa can identifynot only kinetically influential reactions but also species. the softwareprovides two techniques for large reaction mechanisms for which lsais too expensive to run. one is the fischer information matrix, whichis approximate but comes at nearly zero cost. the other is a new methodthat we term rpa-guided lsa, which is a finite difference-based methodbut uses rpa to select kinetically relevant reactions instead of exploitingthe entire reaction network. users can quickly set up and conductmicrokinetic simulations without writing code. the user inputs areconveniently divided into reactor setup files and thermodynamic andkinetic definition files to set up different reactors. the sourcecode and documentation are openly available at https://github.com/vlachosgroup/openmkm.",AB_0582
"pleurocystitid echinoderms are known to have consistent plating in the theca or body. however, many specimens with aberrant plating are known among glyptocystitoids (glyptocystella, hadrocystis, tyrridiocystis, and so on) as well as the new ordovician species pleurocystites? scylla, described here from the benbolt formation near thorn hill, tennessee, usa. the presence of an extra plate in the holotype of p? scylla is most likely teratological. while teratology is often misconstrued as parasitism and pathology, it is easily recognized among glyptocystitoid rhombiferans because of the conservative nature of plate arrangements found in these taxa. teratologic features in stemmed echinoderm thecae appear only to alter suture positioning and not significantly change the thecal shape or diminish the diagnosability of a specimen taxonomically.uuid: http://zoobank.org/287bb0b9-2df5-4b9a-b1ea-0d3cd7923826",AB_0582
"background: sit-to-stand and treadmill desks may help sedentary office workers meet the physical activity guideline to move more and sit less, but little is known about their long-term impact on altering the accumulation patterns of physical behaviors. objective: this study explores the impact of sit-to-stand and treadmill desks on physical behavior accumulation patterns during a 12-month multicomponent intervention with an intent-to-treat design in overweight and obese seated office workers. methods: in total, 66 office workers were cluster randomized into a seated desk control (n=21, 32%; 8 clusters), sit-to-stand desk (n=23, 35%; 9 clusters), or treadmill desk (n=22, 33%; 7 clusters) group. participants wore an activpal (pal technologies ltd) accelerometer for 7 days at baseline, 3-month follow-up (m3), 6-month follow-up (m6), and 12-month follow-up (m12) and received periodic feedback on their physical behaviors. analyses of physical behavior patterns included total day and workday number of sedentary, standing, and stepping bouts categorized into durations ranging from 1 to 60 and >60 minutes and usual sedentary, standing, and stepping bout durations. intervention trends were analyzed using random-intercept mixed linear models accounting for repeated measures and clustering effects. results: the treadmill desk group favored prolonged sedentary bouts (>60 min), whereas the sit-to-stand desk group accrued more short-duration sedentary bouts (<20 min). therefore, compared with controls, sit-to-stand desk users had shorter usual sedentary bout durations short-term (total day delta m3: -10.1 min/bout, 95% ci -17.9 to -2.2; p=.01; workday delta m3: -20.3 min/bout, 95% ci -37.7 to -2.9; p=.02), whereas treadmill desk users had longer usual sedentary bout durations long-term (total day delta m12: 9.0 min/bout, 95% ci 1.6-16.4; p=.02). the treadmill desk group favored prolonged standing bouts (30-60 min and >60 min), whereas the sit-to-stand desk group accrued more short-duration standing bouts (<20 min). as such, relative to controls, treadmill desk users had longer usual standing bout durations short-term (total day delta m3: 6.9 min/bout, 95% ci 2.5-11.4; p=.002; workday delta m3: 8.9 min/bout, 95% ci 2.1-15.7; p=.01) and sustained this long-term (total day delta m12: 4.5 min/bout, 95% ci 0.7-8.4; p=.02; workday delta m12: 5.8 min/bout, 95% ci 0.9-10.6; p=.02), whereas sit-to-stand desk users showed this trend only in the long-term (total day delta m12: 4.2 min/bout, 95% ci 0.1-8.3; p=.046). the treadmill desk group accumulated more stepping bouts across various bins of duration (5-50 min), primarily at m3. thus, treadmill desk users had longer usual stepping bout durations in the short-term compared with controls (workday delta m3: 4.8 min/bout, 95% ci 1.3-8.3; p=.007) and in the short-and long-term compared with sit-to-stand desk users (workday delta m3: 4.7 min/bout, 95% ci 1.6-7.8; p=.003; workday delta m12: 3.0 min/bout, 95% ci 0.1-5.9; p=.04). conclusions: sit-to-stand desks exerted potentially more favorable physical behavior accumulation patterns than treadmill desks. future active workstation trials should consider strategies to promote more frequent long-term movement bouts and dissuade prolonged static postural fixity.trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02376504; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct02376504",AB_0582
