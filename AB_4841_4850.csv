"background:endovascular treatment (evt) for acute ischemic stroke (ais) patients presenting with national institutes of health stroke scale score of 0 to 5 is common in clinical practice but has not yet been proven safe and effective. our objective is to assess whether evt on top of best medical treatment (bmt) in ais patients with large-vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation presenting with mild symptoms is beneficial compared with bmt.methods:we searched medline, scopus, and reference lists of retrieved articles published until december 28, 2022. a systematic literature search was conducted to identify clinical trials or observational cohort studies evaluating patients with ais due to anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion and admission national institutes of health stroke scale score & le;5 treated with evt versus bmt alone. the primary outcome was excellent functional outcome (modified rankin scale score 0-1) at 3 months. the protocol had been registered before data collection (prospero).results:eleven observational eligible studies were included in the meta-analysis, comprising a total of 2019 ais patients with national institutes of health stroke scale score & le;5 treated with evt versus 3171 patients treated with bmt. evt was not associated with excellent functional outcome (risk ratio, 1.10 [95% ci, 0.93-1.31]). when stratified for different study design (per-protocol versus intention-to-treat), there were no significant subgroup differences. evt was not associated with good functional outcome (modified rankin scale score 0-2; risk ratio, 1.01 [95% ci, 0.89-1.16]) or reduced disability at 3 months (common odds ratio, 0.92 [95% ci, 0.60-1.41]). symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was more common in the patients receiving evt (risk ratio, 3.53 [95% ci, 2.35-5.31]). no correlation was found between evt and mortality at 3 months (risk ratio, 1.34 [95% ci, 0.83-2.18]). the same overall associations were confirmed in the sensitivity analysis of studies that performed propensity score matching.conclusions:evt appears equivalent to bmt for patients with anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion ais with low baseline national institutes of health stroke scale, despite the increased risk for symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.registration:url: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/; unique identifier: crd42022334417.",AB_0485
"objective: the scarcity of high-quality annotated data is omnipresent in machine learning. especially in biomedical segmentation applications, experts need to spend a lot of their time into annotating due to the complexity. hence, methods to reduce such efforts are desired. methods: self-supervised learning (ssl) is an emerging field that increases performance when unannotated data is present. however, profound studies regarding segmentation tasks and small datasets are still absent. a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation is conducted, examining ssl's applicability with a focus on biomedical imaging. we consider various metrics and introduce multiple novel application-specific measures. all metrics and state-of-the-art methods are provided in a directly applicable software package (https://osf.io/gu2t8/). results: we show that ssl can lead to performance improvements of up to 10%, which is especially notable for methods designed for segmentation tasks. conclusion: ssl is a sensible approach to data-efficient learning, especially for biomedical applications, where generating annotations requires much effort. additionally, our extensive evaluation pipeline is vital since there are significant differences between the various approaches. significance: we provide biomedical practitioners with an overview of innovative data-efficient solutions and a novel toolbox for their own application of new approaches. our pipeline for analyzing ssl methods is provided as a ready-to-use software package.",AB_0485
"distinguishing among different marine benthic habitat characteristics is of key importance in a wide set of seabed operations ranging from installations of oil rigs to laying networks of cables and monitoring the impact of humans on marine ecosystems. the side-scan sonar (sss) is a widely used imaging sensor in this regard. it produces high-resolution seafloor maps by logging the intensities of sound waves reflected back from the seafloor. in this work, we leverage these acoustic intensity maps to produce pixel-wise categorization of different seafloor types. we propose a novel architecture adapted from the vision transformer (vit) in an encoder-decoder framework. further, in doing so, the applicability of vits is evaluated on smaller datasets. to overcome the lack of cnn-like inductive biases, thereby making vits more conducive to applications in low data regimes, we propose a novel feature extraction module to replace the multi-layer perceptron (mlp) block within transformer layers and a novel module to extract multiscale patch embeddings. a lightweight decoder is also proposed to complement this design in order to further enhance multiscale feature extraction. with the modified architecture, we achieve state-of-the-art results and also meet real-time computational requirements. we make our code available at https://github.com/hayatrajani/s3seg-vit.",AB_0485
"conservation gardening (cg) represents a socio-ecological approach to address the decline of native plant species and transform the gardening industry into an innovative conservation tool. however, essential information regarding amenable plants, their ecological requirements for gardening, and commercial availability remains limited and not readily available. in this study, we present a workflow using germany as a case study to bridge this knowledge gap. we synthesized the red lists of all 16 federal states in germany, and text-mined a comprehensive platform for garden plants, as well as multiple german producers of native plants. to provide accessible information, we developed a user-friendly app (https://conservation-gardening.shinyapps.io/app-en/) that offers region-specific lists of cg plants, along with practical guidance for planting and purchasing. our findings reveal that a median of 845 plant species are red-listed across federal states (ranging from 515 to 1123), with 41% of these species amenable to gardening (ranging from 29 to 53%), resulting in a total of 988 cg species. notably, 66% of these species (650) are already available for purchase. additionally, we observed that many cg plants exhibit drought tolerance and require less fertilizer on average, with implications for long-term urban planning and climate adaptation. collaborating with gardening experts, we present a selection of purchasable cg balcony plants for each federal state, highlighting the feasibility of cg even for individuals without gardens. with a multitude of declining plants amenable to gardening and the vital role of gardens as refuges and green corridors, cg holds substantial potential to catalyze transformative change in bending the curve of biodiversity loss.",AB_0485
"in real-life interactions, it is crucial that humans adequately respond to others' emotional expressions. emotion perception so far has mainly been studied in highly controlled laboratory tasks. however, recent research suggests that attention and gaze behaviour significantly differ between watching a person on a controlled laboratory screen compared to in real world interactions. therefore, the current study aimed to investigate effects of emotional expression on participants' gaze in social and non-social situations. we compared looking behaviour towards a confederate showing positive, neutral or negative facial expressions between live social and non-social waiting room situations. participants looked more often and longer to the confederate on the screen, than when physically present in the room. expressions displayed by the confederate and individual traits (social anxiety and autistic traits) of participants did not reliably relate to gaze behaviour. indications of covert attention also occurred more often and longer during the non-social, than during the social condition. findings indicate that social norm is a strong factor modulating gaze behaviour in social contexts.protocol registrationthe stage 1 protocol for this registered report was accepted in principle on september 13, 2021. the protocol, as accepted by the journal, can be found at: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16628290.",AB_0485
"motivation: mixed molecular data combines continuous and categorical features of the same samples, such as omics profiles with genotypes, diagnoses, or patient sex. like all high-dimensional molecular data, it is prone to incorrect values that can stem from various sources for example the technical limitations of the measurement devices, errors in the sample preparation, or contamination. most anomaly detection algorithms identify complete samples as outliers or anomalies. however, in most cases, not all measurements of those samples are erroneous but only a few one-dimensional features within the samples are incorrect. these one-dimensional data errors are continuous measurements that are either located outside or inside the normal ranges of their features but in both cases show atypical values given all other continuous and categorical features in the sample. additionally, categorical anomalies can occur for example when the genotype or diagnosis was submitted wrongly. results: we introduce admire (anomaly detection using mixed graphical models), a novel approach for the detection and correction of anomalies in mixed high-dimensional data. hereby, we focus on the detection of single (one-dimensional) data errors in the categorical and continuous features of a sample. for that the joint distribution of continuous and categorical features is learned by mixed graphical models, anomalies are detected by the difference between measured and model-based estimations and are corrected using imputation. we evaluated admire in simulation and by screening for anomalies in one of our own metabolic datasets. in simulation experiments, admire outperformed the state-of-the-art methods of local outlier factor, stray, and isolation forest. availability and implementation: all data and code is available at https://github.com/spang-lab/adadmire. admire is implemented in a python package called adadmire which can be found at https://pypi.org/project/adadmire.",AB_0485
"self-supervised learning, which is strikingly referred to as the dark matter of intelligence, is gaining more attention in biomedical applications of deep learning. in this work, we introduce a novel self-supervision objective for the analysis of cells in biomedical microscopy images. we propose training deep learning models to pseudo-colorize masked cells. we use a physics-informed pseudo-spectral colormap that is well suited for colorizing cell topology. our experiments reveal that approximating semantic segmentation by pseudo-colorization is beneficial for subsequent fine-tuning on cell detection. inspired by the recent success of masked image modeling, we additionally mask out cell parts and train to reconstruct these parts to further enrich the learned representations. we compare our pre-training method with self-supervised frameworks including contrastive learning (simclr), masked autoencoders (maes), and edge-based self-supervision. we build upon our previous work and train hybrid models for cell detection, which contain both convolutional and vision transformer modules. our pre-training method can outperform simclr, mae-like masked image modeling, and edge-based self-supervision when pre-training on a diverse set of six fluorescence microscopy datasets. code is available at: https://github.com/roydenwa/pseudo-colorize-masked-cells.",AB_0485
"background patients' expectations toward any given treatment are highly important for the effectiveness of such treatment, as has been demonstrated for several disorders. in particular, in major depressive disorder (mdd), one of the most frequent and most serious mental disorders with severe consequences for the affected, the augmentation of available treatment options could mean a ground-breaking success. repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms), a new, non-invasive, and well-tolerated intervention with proven effects in the treatment of mdd, appears particularly suitable in this context as it is assumed to exert its effect via structures implicated in networks relevant for both expectation and depression.methods all patients will receive rtms according to its approval. half of the patients will be randomized to a psychological intervention, which is a comprehensive medical consultation aiming to improve positive treatment expectations; the control group will receive a conventional informed consent discussion (in the sense of a treatment-as-usual condition). as outcome parameters, instruments for both self-assessment and external assessment of depression symptoms will be applied. furthermore, psycho-immunological parameters such as inflammation markers and the cortisol awakening response in saliva will be investigated. resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs fmri) will be performed to analyze functional connectivity, including the cerebellum, and to identify neuronal predictors of expectation effects. in addition, possible cerebellar involvement will be assessed based on a cerebellar-dependent motor learning paradigm (i.e., eyeblink conditioning).discussion in this study, the effects of treatment expectations towards rtms are investigated in patients with mdd. the aim of this study is to identify the mechanisms underlying the expectation effects and, beyond that, to expand the potential of non-invasive and well-tolerated treatments of mdd.trial registrationgerman registry of clinical studies (drks drks00028017. registered on 2022/03/07. url: https://www.drks.de/drks_web/.",AB_0485
"this paper describes a simple method for characterizing global-scale waves in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (mlt), such as tides and traveling planetary waves, using uniformly gridded two-dimensional longitude-time data. the technique involves two steps. in the first step, the fourier transform is performed in space (longitude), and then the time series of the space fourier coefficients are derived. in the second step, the wavelet transform is performed on these time series, and wavelet coefficients are derived. a fourier-wavelet spectrum can be obtained from these wavelet coefficients, which gives the amplitude and phase of the wave as a function of time and wave period. it can be used to identify wave activity that is localized in time, similar to a wavelet spectrum, but the fourier-wavelet spectrum can be obtained separately for eastward- and westward-propagating components and for different zonal wavenumbers. the fourier-wavelet analysis can be easily implemented using existing fourier and wavelet software. matlab and python scripts are created and made available at https://igit.iap-kborn.de/yamazaki/fourierwavelet (last access: 18 august 2023) that compute fourier-wavelet spectra using the wavelet software provided by . some application examples are presented using mlt data from atmospheric models.",AB_0485
"we present a new computer program, feyntrop, which uses the tropical geometric approach to evaluate feynman integrals numerically. in order to apply this approach in the physical regime, we introduce a new parametric representation of feynman integrals that implements the causal ie prescription concretely while retaining projective invariance. feyntrop can efficiently evaluate dimensionally regulated, quasi-finite feynman integrals, with not too exceptional kinematics in the physical regime, with a relatively large number of propagators and with arbitrarily many kinematic scales. we give a systematic classification of all relevant kinematic regimes, review the necessary mathematical details of the tropical monte carlo approach, give fast algorithms to evaluate (deformed) feynman integrands, describe the usage of feyntrop and discuss many explicit examples of evaluated feynman integrals.program summaryprogram title: feyntrop.cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /k6r62hdgvd .1developer's repository link: https://github .com /michibo /feyntrop. licensing provisions: mit license.programming language: the tropical monte carlo code is written in c++. the high-level interface is written in python.supplementary material: the repository includes installation and usage instructions (readme.md), a jupyter notebook tutorial (tutorial_2l_3pt.ipynb), the collection of examples presented in section 6 (see the folder /examples), and a test suite to ensure a successful installation (see the folder /tests).nature of problem: sufficiently fast numerical integration of (dimensionally regularized) feynman integrals (also in the minkowski regime of phase space). solution method: tropical monte carlo integration of a manifestly i6-free parametric representation of feynman integrals.additional comments: the program feyntrop is based on previous code available at https://github .com / michibo /tropical -feynman-quadrature, which was published as a proof-of-concept with, michael borinsky, 'tropical monte carlo quadrature for feynman integrals', ann. inst. henri poincare comb. phys. interact.
