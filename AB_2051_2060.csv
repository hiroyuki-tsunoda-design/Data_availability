"background: to assess the effectiveness of the nurse-led individualised self-care model on myocardial infarction (mi) patients with diabetes. methods: a total of 120 mi patients were enrolled from may 2020 to december 2021. the intervention group received the nurse-led individualised self-care model (n = 60), whereas the control group only received routine health education (n = 60). the myocardial infarction dimensional assessment scale (midas), coronary heart disease self-management behavior scale (csms), self-rated abilities for health practices (srahp) scale, general self-efficacy scale (gses), hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads), blood glucose and nursing satisfaction in both groups were observed and recorded. results: the six midas subscales except for insecurity, and all dimensions of the csms, srahp, gses and hads scores, of the intervention group were significantly improved compared to those of the control group (p < 0.05). compared with the control group (5.69 +/- 1.43 mmol/l), the intervention group showed a decrease in the serum levels of fasting blood glucose (4.83 +/- 1.57 mmol/l; p < 0.01). conclusions: our pilot study provides preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility of implementing nurse-led individualised self-care, suggesting its preliminary effects in improving health-related quality of life, self-care ability, health behaviours, self-efficacy, social support and nursing satisfaction among mi patients with diabetes. however, considering the unblinded and pilot nature of this study, these positive results should be interpreted with caution. clinical trial registration: osf registration number: doi 10.17605/osf.io/dvw95 (https://archive.org/details/osf-r egistrations-dvw95-v1).",AB_0206
"background: as an emerging arrhythmia monitor, ambulatory smartwatch electrocardiogram (ecg) provides an option for home -based monitoring of delayed new-onset arrhythmic events after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (tavr). we aimed to validate the diagnostic efficacy of a consumer smartwatch ecg in tavr recipients, while further explore the occurrence rate of both tachy-and brady-arrhythmia for 30 days after discharge to support risk management. methods: consecutive tavr recipients from february 26th, 2021 to december 13th, 2021 were enrolled prospectively, receiving simultaneous 24-hour holter and 12-lead ecg compared with smartwatch ecg during hospitalization and daily smartwatch ecg collection for 30 days after discharge. results: among 110 patients, the efficacy of smartwatch ecg presented sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing atrial fibrillation (af) as 1.00 and 0.97, left bundle branch block (lbbb) as 0.61 and 0.88, and right bundle branch block (rbbb) as 0.60 and 0.97, respectively, compared with 24-hour holter; presented sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing af as 0.88 and 1.00, lbbb as 0.90 and 0.96, and rbbb as 0.83 and 0.94, respectively, compared with 12-lead ecg. at 30-day follow-up, new-onset arrhythmia included new-onset severe conduction disturbance (scd) (23.6%), new-onset af (21.8%), new-onset permanent lbbb (14.5%) and new-onset permanent rbbb (0.9%); 69.2% (36/52) of early new-onset lbbb recovered at 30-day follow-up. conclusions: the diagnostic efficacy of consumer smartwatch ecg in arrhythmic events among tavr population was acceptable, which provided a recommendable option for home-based management. clinical trial registration: continuously ambulatory rhythm monitoring and predictors of electrocardio-related adverse events in 30 days after transcatheter aortic valve replacement; identifier: chictr2000041244; http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=66324.",AB_0206
"learning a robust object detector in adverse weather with real-time efficiency is of great importance for the visual perception task for autonomous driving systems. in this article, we propose a framework to improve the yolo to a robust detector, denoted as r(obust)-yolo, without the need for annotations in adverse weather. considering the distribution gap between the normal weather images and the adverse weather images, our framework consists of an image quasi-translation network (qtnet) and a feature calibration network (fcnet) for adapting the normal weather domain to the adverse weather domain gradually. specifically, we use the simple yet effective qtnet for generating images that inherit the annotations in the normal weather domain and interpolate the gap between the two domains. then, in fcnet, we propose two kinds of adversarial-learning-based feature calibration modules to effectively align the feature representations in two domains in a local-to-global manner. with such a learning framework, our r-yolo does not change the original yolo structure, and thus it is applicable to all the yolo-series detectors. extensive experimental results of our r-yolov3, r-yolov5, and r-yolox on both the hazy and rainy datasets show that our method outperforms other detectors with dehaze/derain as the preprocessing step and other unsupervised domain adaptation (uda)-based detectors, which confirms the effectiveness of our method on improving the robustness by only leveraging the unlabeled adverse weather images. our code and pretrained models are available at: https://github.com/qinhongda8/r-yolo.",AB_0206
"background: in contrast to the large and increasing number of patients with stroke, clinical rehabilitation resources cannot meet their rehabilitation needs. especially for those discharged, ways to carry out effective rehabilitation training without the supervision of physicians and receive guidance from physicians remain urgent problems to be solved in clinical rehabilitation and have become a research hot spot at home and abroad. at present, there are many studies on home rehabilitation training based on wearable devices, kinect, among others, but these have disadvantages (eg, complex systems, high price, and unsatisfactory rehabilitation effects). objective: this study aims to design a remote intelligent rehabilitation training system based on wearable devices and human-computer interaction training tasks, and to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the remote rehabilitation training system for nonphysician-supervised motor rehabilitation training of patients with stroke through a clinical trial study.methods: a total of 120 inpatients with stroke having limb motor dysfunction were enrolled via a randomized, parallel-controlled method in the rehabilitation institutions, and a 3-week clinical trial was conducted in the rehabilitation hall with 60 patients in the experimental group and 60 in the control group. the patients in the experimental group used the remote rehabilitation training system for rehabilitation training and routine clinical physical therapy (pt) training and received routine drug treatment every day. the patients in the control group received routine clinical occupational therapy (ot) training and routine clinical pt training and routine drug treatment every day. at the beginning of the training (baseline) and after 3 weeks, the fugl-meyer motor function rating scale was scored by rehabilitation physicians, and the results were compared and analyzed.results: statistics were performed using sas software (version 9.4). the total mean fugl-meyer score improved by 11.98 (sd 8.46; 95% ci 9.69-14.27) in the control group and 17.56 (sd 11.65; 95% ci 14.37-20.74) in the experimental group, and the difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant (p=.005). among them, the mean fugl-meyer upper extremity score improved by 7.45 (sd 7.24; 95% ci 5.50-9.41) in the control group and 11.28 (sd 8.59; 95% ci 8.93-13.62) in the experimental group, and the difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant (p=.01). the mean fugl-meyer lower extremity score improved by 4.53 (sd 4.42; 95% ci 3.33-5.72) in the control group and 6.28 (sd 5.28; 95% ci 4.84-7.72) in the experimental group, and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (p=.06). the test results showed that the experimental group was better than the control group, and that the patients' motor ability was improved.conclusions: the remote rehabilitation training system designed based on wearable devices and human-computer interaction training tasks can replace routine clinical ot training. in the future, through medical device registration certification, the system will be used without the participation of physicians or therapists, such as in rehabilitation training halls, and in remote environments, such as communities and homes.trial registration: chinese clinical trial registry chictr2200061310; https://tinyurl.com/34ka2725",AB_0206
"scrap steel grading is a vital stage of steel production. thickness is an important indicator in determining the grade of scrap steel. existing methods based on 2-d vision cannot accurately estimate the thickness of scrap steel due to the lack of 3-d information. consequently, estimation results from 2-d methods cannot satisfy the requirements of the steel industry. to solve this problem, we propose a 3-d vision-based scrap steel grading system. we introduce a novel thickness feature descriptor that can perform edge detection on organized point clouds. it can detect the pairs of points that satisfy the thickness feature from edge points. once the detection of all thickness features is completed, invalid thickness features are filtered and correct thickness features are merged based on the contextual information. finally, a thickness feature histogram (tfh) is calculated, and tfh is used for grading scrap steel. our proposed method was integrated into a scrap steel grading system, which has been used in an actual production environment. comprehensive experiments have been conducted to validate the proposed method. moreover, a specialized scrap steel image dataset was created to train deep-learning-based methods in comparison experiments. experimental results show that our method can extract thickness features and estimate the distribution of thickness of scrap steel effectively. the grading system has been successfully used in actual task scenarios and satisfies the industrial grading requirements. the scrap steel dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/zichengzichengzi/scrap steel image dataset.",AB_0206
"in recent years, computer vision systems have been increasingly applied to rail defect inspection. rail defects should be identified quickly and accurately to ensure safe, stable, and fast train operations and thereby reduce the incidence of accidents and economic losses. as most existing methods focus on accuracy, they cannot be deployed on mobile devices with limited computational resources. to solve this problem, we propose a lightweight feature hierarchical exploration network (fhenet) for real-time rail surface defect inspection. first, boundary textures of rail defects are acquired based on the maximum function and maximum pooling in a novel boundary extraction module (bem), which improves boundary prediction while avoiding heavy computations. second, a novel cross-modality exploration module (cem) complements prominent regions through basic operations to avoid complex inference while providing high detection performance. third, a novel multifeature integration module (mim) optimizes representative feature regions by using simple operations to avoid complex computations. results from extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed fhenet to 14 state-of-the-art methods. regarding efficiency, fhenet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with only 5.26 m parameters and a processing speed of 60.33 frames/s. the fhenet code and results are available at https://github.com/hjklearn/rail-defect-detection.",AB_0206
"the application of single-image superresolution (sisr) in remote sensing is of great significance. although the state-of-the-art convolution neural network (cnn)-based sisr methods have achieved excellent results, the large model and slow speed make it difficult to deploy in real remote sensing tasks. in this article, we propose a compact and efficient distance attention residual network (darn) to achieve a better compromise between model accuracy and complexity. the distance attention residual connection block (darcb), the core component of the darn, uses multistage feature aggregation to learn more accurate feature representations. the main branch of the darcb adopts a shallow residual block (srb) to flexibly learn residual information to ensure the robustness of the model. we also propose a distance attention block (dab) as a bridge between the main branch and the branch of the darcb; the dab can effectively alleviate the loss of detail features in the deep cnn extraction process. experimental results on two remote sensing and five super-resolution benchmark datasets demonstrate that the darn achieves a better compromise than existing methods in terms of performance and model complexity. in addition, the darn achieves the optimal solution compared with the state-of-the-art lightweight remote sensing sisr method in terms of parameter amount, computation amount, and inference speed. our code will be available at https://github.com/candygogogogo/darn.",AB_0206

"background: the effect of anterograde lavage in patients with rectal cancer who underwent anterior resection and plan to receive stoma closure is unclear. objective: this study aimed to investigate the effect of anterograde lavage on postoperative bowel function recovery in patients who underwent temporary loop ileostomy and stoma closure. design: this was a hospital-based retrospective cohort study. settings: this study was conducted at a tertiary referral center. patients: all consecutive patients who underwent anterior resection for rectal cancer and were planning to receive stoma closure from march through december 2019 were included. interventions: the enrolled patients were divided into 2 groups according to whether they received anterograde lavage before stoma closure. main outcome measures: short-term functional outcomes, including time to first passing of flatus, first defecation time, and recovery time to first meal, were compared between the groups. secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, total cost of hospitalization, and postoperative complications. results: a total of 222 eligible participants were included in the analysis, including 114 in the lavage group and 108 in the nonlavage group. no statistically significant differences were found in age, sex ratio, or distance between the anastomotic line and dentate line. in the lavage group, patients' time to first passing of flatus (38 vs 42h; p = 0.006), first defecation time (42 vs 48h; p < 0.001), recovery time to first meal (48 vs 55.5h; p < 0.001), and length of hospital stay (5 vs 7 d; p < 0.001) were significantly shorter than those in the nonlavage group, and the total cost of hospitalization was significantly lower than that of the nonlavage group (25,000 vs 28,000 rmb; p < 0.001). no significant difference was found in the incidence of postoperative complications between the 2 groups (p = 0.067). limitations: this study is limited by its relatively small sample size and retrospective design with single-center participants. conclusions: anterograde lavage before stoma closure is safe and noninvasive. for patients receiving anterior resection and planning to have stoma closure, this procedure can potentially help recover bowel function more rapidly. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c51.",AB_0206
"with the discovery of causality between synonymous mutations and diseases, it has become increasingly important to identify deleterious synonymous mutations for better understanding of their functional mechanisms. although several machine learning methods have been proposed to solve the task, an effective feature representation method that can make use of the inner difference and relevance between deleterious and benign synonymous mutations is still challenging considering the vast number of synonymous mutations in human genome. in thiswork, we developed a robust and accurate predictor called frdsm for deleterious synonymous mutation prediction using logistic regression. more specifically, we introduced an effective feature representation learning method which exploits multiple feature descriptors from different perspectives including functional scores obtained from previously computational methods, evolutionary conservation, splicing and sequence feature descriptors, and these features descriptors were input into the 76 xgboost classifiers to obtain the predictive probabilities values. these probabilitieswere concatenated to generate the 76-dimension new feature vector, and feature selection method was used to remove redundant and irrelevant features. experimental results show that frdsm enables robust and accurate prediction than the competing prediction methods with 31 optimal features, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the feature representation learning method. frdsm is freely available at http://frdsm.xialab.info.",AB_0206
