"background: right ventricular failure (rvf) is a leading driver of morbidity and death after major cardiac surgery for advanced heart failure, including orthotopic heart transplantation and left ventricular assist device implantation. inhaled pulmonary-selective vasodilators, such as inhaled epoprostenol (iepo) and nitric oxide (ino), are essential therapeutics for the prevention and medical management of postoperative rvf. however, there is limited evidence from clinical trials to guide agent selection despite the significant cost considerations of ino therapy.methods: in this double-blind trial, participants were stratified by assigned surgery and key preoperative prognostic features, then randomized to continuously receive either iepo or ino beginning at the time of separation from cardiopulmonary bypass with the continuation of treatment into the intensive care unit stay. the primary outcome was the composite rvf rate after both operations, defined after transplantation by the initiation of mechanical circulatory support for isolated rvf, and defined after left ventricular assist device implantation by moderate or severe right heart failure according to criteria from the interagency registry for mechanically assisted circulatory support. an equivalence margin of 15 percentage points was prespecified for between-group rvf risk difference. secondary postoperative outcomes were assessed for treatment differences and included: mechanical ventilation duration; hospital and intensive care unit length of stay during the index hospitalization; acute kidney injury development including renal replacement therapy initiation; and death at 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year after surgery.results: of 231 randomized participants who met eligibility at the time of surgery, 120 received iepo, and 111 received ino. primary outcome occurred in 30 participants (25.0%) in the iepo group and 25 participants (22.5%) in the ino group, for a risk difference of 2.5 percentage points (two one-sided test 90% ci, -6.6% to 11.6%) in support of equivalence. there were no significant between-group differences for any of the measured postoperative secondary outcomes.conclusions: among patients undergoing major cardiac surgery for advanced heart failure, inhaled pulmonary-selective vasodilator treatment using iepo was associated with similar risks for rvf development and development of other postoperative secondary outcomes compared with treatment using ino.registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct03081052.",AB_0571
"as robots acquire increasingly sophisticated skills and see increasingly complex and varied environments, the threat of an edge case or anomalous failure is ever present. for example, tesla cars have seen interesting failure modes ranging from autopilot disengagements due to inactive traffic lights carried by trucks to phantom braking caused by images of stop signs on roadside billboards. these system-level failures are not due to failures of any individual component of the autonomy stack but rather system-level deficiencies in semantic reasoning. such edge cases, which we call semantic anomalies, are simple for a human to disentangle yet require insightful reasoning. to this end, we study the application of large language models (llms), endowed with broad contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities, to recognize such edge cases and introduce a monitoring framework for semantic anomaly detection in vision-based policies. our experiments apply this framework to a finite state machine policy for autonomous driving and a learned policy for object manipulation. these experiments demonstrate that the llm-based monitor can effectively identify semantic anomalies in a manner that shows agreement with human reasoning. finally, we provide an extended discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and motivate a research outlook on how we can further use foundation models for semantic anomaly detection. our project webpage can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/llm-anomaly-detection.",AB_0571
"density functional theory (dft) is indubitably the most popular and among the most successful approaches for approximately solving the many-electron schro''dinger equation. the level of understanding on the part of both researchers and students using dft, however, is lacking, given the availability of black-box software. the present work addresses this knowledge gap by providing three jupyter notebooks, easily accessible through the google colaboratory (github repository: https://github.com/tjz21/dft_pib_code), that provide a short skirmish with the fundamentals of dft through a particle in a box-type model system. these notebooks were tested in conjunction with a problem worksheet in a graduate-level quantum chemistry course; pre- and postactivity survey results reveal largely positive reactions to this implementation and sustained enthusiasm for the subject.",AB_0571
"despite the increased number of evidence-based guidelines for sickle cell disease (scd), dissemination of evidence-based guidelines in lay language for individuals or families with scd has not been evaluated. we conducted a feasibility randomized controlled trial to determine the acceptability of a mobile health (mhealth) app with patient-facing guidelines to improve the knowledge of individuals with scd about scd-specific knowledge and reduce hospitalizations. primary outcome measures include recruitment, retention, and adherence rates. adults with scd were enrolled at 2 sickle cell centers between 2018 and 2022. participants were randomized to receive either an mhealth app + booklet with patient-facing guidelines or a booklet with the guidelines alone. participants completed surveys at baseline and a final 6-month visit. approximately 67 of 74 (91%) agreed to participate and were randomized, with 50 of 67 (75%) completing all the study components. all participants who completed the study in the treatment arm used the app. our results demonstrated high recruitment, retention, and adherence rate for the first randomized trial for an mhealth app with patient-facing guidelines in adults with scd. this clinical trial was registered at https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ as #nct03629678.",AB_0571
"a new kannemeyeriiform dicynodont is described from the upper triassic tecovas formation (dockum group) of west texas, u.s.a. the taxon, argodicynodon boreni gen. et sp. nov., is diagnosed by numerous cranial characters including: squamosal-interparietal sutural contact broad and interdigitating; tall, narrow intertemporal region formed by the parietals with long postorbitals forming the lateral face of the dorsal platform; interparietal forms knobby, bilobed exostoses that wedge between the parietals to form a w-shaped outline in dorsal view; basioccipital and exoccipital contributions to the occipital condyle are distinct, and the dorsal fossa separating the exoccipitals is deeply incised and dorsoventrally deep; caniniform process of the maxilla is dorsoventrally deep and well developed; and an elongated tab-like medial process of the articular exceeds the width of the quadrate roller. a phylogenetic analysis based on 23 continuous and 176 discrete (numeric) morphological characters and 120 taxa finds argodicynodon conservatively to be a placeriine near the placerias + moghreberia group, representing the oldest placeriine in the southwestern u.s.a. and the first named dicynodont genus from the dockum group of texas. a review of euramerican dicynodont records exposes their hidden diversity and abundance in laurasia during the late triassic. the records of argodicynodon and other previously undescribed dicynodont fossils from nearby localities underscores the diversity of non-placerias dicynodonts in the north american upper triassic.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:ab9b7abc-6c84-4b04-909f-f1da114030ab",AB_0571
"ultra-large chemical libraries are reaching 10s to 100s of billions of molecules. a challenge for these libraries is to efficiently check if a proposed molecule is present. here we propose and study bloom filters for testing if a molecule is present in a set using either string or fingerprint representations. bloom filters are small enough to hold billions of molecules in just a few gb of memory and check membership in sub milliseconds. we found string representations can have a false positive rate below 1% and require significantly less storage than using fingerprints. canonical smiles with bloom filters with the simple fnv (fowler-noll-voll) hashing function provide fast and accurate membership tests with small memory requirements. we provide a general implementation and specific filters for detecting if a molecule is purchasable, patented, or a natural product according to existing databases at https:// github.com/whitead/molbloom.",AB_0571
"a pathologic feature of late-onset retinal degeneration caused by the s163r mutation in c1q-tumor necrosis factor-5 (c1qtnf5) is the presence of unusually thick deposits between the retinal pigmented epithelium (rpe) and the vascular choroid, considered a hallmark of this disease. following its specific expression in mouse rpe, the s163r mutant exhibits a reversed polarized distribution relative to the apically secreted wild-type c1qtnf5, and forms widespread, prominent deposits that gradually increase in size with aging. the current study shows that s163r deposits expand to a considerable thickness through a progressive increase in the basolateral rpe membrane, substantially raising the total rpe height, and enabling their clear imaging as a distinct hyporeflective layer by noninvasive optical coherence tomography in advanced age animals. this phenotype bears a striking resemblance to ocular pathology previously documented in patients harboring the s163r mutation. therefore, a similar viral vector-based gene delivery approach was used to also investigate the behavior of p188t and g216c, two novel pathogenic c1qtnf5 mutants recently reported in patients for which histopathologic data are lacking. both mutants primarily impacted the rpe/photoreceptor interface and did not generate basal laminar deposits. distinct distribution patterns and phenotypic consequences of c1qtnf5 mutants were observed in vivo, which suggested that multiple pathobiological mechanisms contribute to rpe dysfunction and vision loss in this disorder.

"sediments of the woodbine group exposed in northeastern texas were deposited along the southwestern margin of appalachia as a series of near-shore, shoreline, distal lowland swamp, lake, and fluvial deposits during a regression of the western interior seaway in early and middle cenomanian time. the lewisville formation (upper woodbine group) of north texas preserves the most diverse terrestrial fossil assemblage known from appalachia, but remains of small ornithischian dinosaurs have been conspicuously absent from it. an almost complete left dentary from the lewisville formation represents a new, small-bodied ornithopod taxon, ampelognathus coheni gen. et sp. nov. the dentary is generally similar to those in non-iguanodontian ornithopods such as hypsilophodon, changchunsaurus, haya, and convolosaurus. ampelognathus occupied an expected but previously missing component of the 'mid' cretaceous terrestrial fauna of southwestern appalachia. the growing diversity of fossil vertebrates and renewed paleobotanical study in the lewisville formation reinforces the importance of the unit's fossil record for understanding eastern north american terrestrial ecosystems during an important transitional period in the earliest late cretaceous.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:02642649-ed6f-483a-994a-ec5f3fdf2ac7",AB_0571
"for about 2 decades, oceanographers have been installing oxygen sensors on argo profiling floats to be deployed throughout the world ocean, with the stated objective of better constraining trends and variability in the ocean's inventory of oxygen. until now, measurements from these argo-float-mounted oxygen sensors have been mainly used for localized process studies on air-sea oxygen exchange, upper-ocean primary production, biological pump efficiency, and oxygen minimum zone dynamics. here, we present a new four-dimensional gridded product of ocean interior oxygen, derived via machine learning algorithms trained on dissolved oxygen observations from argo-float-mounted sensors and discrete measurements from ship-based surveys and applied to temperature and salinity fields constructed from the global argo array. the data product is called gobai-o-2, which stands for gridded ocean biogeochemistry from artificial intelligence - oxygen (sharp et al., 2022; https://doi.org/10.25921/z72m-yz67); it covers 86 % of the global ocean area on a 1(degrees) x 1(degrees) (latitude x longitude) grid, spans the years 2004-2022 with a monthly resolution, and extends from the ocean surface to a depth of 2 km on 58 levels. two types of machine learning algorithms - random forest regressions and feed-forward neural networks - are used in the development of gobai-o-2, and the performance of those algorithms is assessed using real observations and simulated observations from earth system model output. machine learning represents a relatively new method for gap filling ocean interior biogeochemical observations and should be explored along with statistical and interpolation-based techniques. gobai-o-2 is evaluated through comparisons to the oxygen climatology from the world ocean atlas, the mapped oxygen product from the global ocean data analysis project and to direct observations from large-scale hydrographic research cruises. finally, potential uses for gobai-o-2 are demonstrated by presenting average oxygen fields on isobaric and isopycnal surfaces, average oxygen fields across vertical-meridional sections, climatological seasonal cycles of oxygen averaged over different pressure layers, and globally integrated time series of oxygen. gobai-o-2 indicates a declining trend in the oxygen inventory in the upper 2 km of the global ocean of 0.79 +/- 0.04 % per decade between 2004 and 2022.",AB_0571
"streamflow gauging stations not only track the pulse of rivers but also act as common reference points for hydrologic and other environmental analyses. as such, streamflow data and metadata on gauging stations - geographic information system (gis) data on station locations, their upstream catchment boundaries and river flow networks - are critical for analyses. however, for india's river basins, the availability of such data is limited; when available, data are not in an analysis-ready format and can have substantial errors. studies often use available information from india's water agencies as is, without checking its validity. this study addresses the above limitations by building a new dataset using existing metadata (from the central water commission, cwc, and the water resources information system, wris) and checking it against publicly available information from global data sources (e.g., world wildlife fund, multi-error-removed improved-terrain hydro and copernicus) and online maps (e.g., google maps). the quality control process categorizes existing metadata based on their consistency with these sources; also, existing metadata are supplemented with additional information where needed. the new dataset developed here is called the geospatial dataset for hydrologic analyses in india (ghi) and uses hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales (hydrosheds) data as the underlying template. ghi has both geospatial and time series information. in this initial version of ghi, the spatial domain includes only the river basins of peninsular india where daily streamflow data are publicly available. following the quality control process, the cwc's 645 stations in peninsular india were categorized into three groups: group 1 (reliable metadata and adequate daily streamflow data; 213 stations), group 2 (reliable metadata and inadequate or no daily streamflow data; 259 stations) and group 3 (missing or unreliable metadata; 173 stations). for each of the 472 stations falling into groups 1 and 2, catchment-specific annual and monthly time series spanning 71 water years (1950-2020) of the following were compiled: observed precipitation from the indian meteorological department (imd); observed streamflow from wris; estimated precipitation, evapotranspiration (et) and streamflow from era5-land; and et from the global land evaporation amsterdam model (gleam). a preliminary analysis of catchment-scale time series of data indicates that, while the compiled data appear reasonable over most of the study domain, spurious runoff-precipitation ratios were observed in the hilly coastal regions of western india. this adds to yet another data-related obstacle faced by the hydrologic community. in order to quantify historical changes and reconcile them with anticipated future changes, the community needs robust and reliable hydrographic and hydrometeorological datasets as well as unrestricted access to such datasets. the goal of this study is to highlight the limitations of existing datasets and pave the way for a community-led effort towards building the needed datasets. ghi serves as a placeholder until such datasets become available. potential improvements to ghi are discussed. ghi is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7563599 (goteti, 2023).",AB_0571
