"background: integration of data from multiple domains can greatly enhance the quality and applicability of knowledge generated in analysis workflows. however, working with health data is challenging, requiring careful preparation in order to support meaningful interpretation and robust results. ontologies encapsulate relationships between variables that can enrich the semantic content of health datasets to enhance interpretability and inform downstream analyses. findings: we developed an r package for electronic health data preparation, ehdprep, demonstrated upon a multimodal colorectal cancer dataset (661 patients, 155 variables; colo-661); a further demonstrator is taken from the cancer genome atlas (459 patients, 94 variables; tcga-coad). ehdprep offers user-friendly methods for quality control, including internal consistency checking and redundancy removal with information-theoretic variable merging. semantic enrichment functionality is provided, enabling generation of new informative meta-variables according to ontological common ancestry between variables, demonstrated with snomed ct and the gene ontology in the current study. ehdprep also facilitates numerical encoding, variable extraction from free text, completeness analysis, and user review of modifications to the dataset. conclusions: ehdprep provides effective tools to assess and enhance data quality, laying the foundation for robust performance and interpretability in downstream analyses. application to multimodal colorectal cancer datasets resulted in improved data quality, structuring, and robust encoding, as well as enhanced semantic information. we make ehdprep available as an r package from cran (https://cran.r-project.org/package=ehdprep) and github (https://github.com/overton-group/ehdprep).",AB_0408
"counting the number of people in a specific area is crucial in maintaining proper crowd safety and management especially in highly-congested indoor scenarios. recent convolutional neural network (cnn) approaches integrate auxiliary sub-networks to increase the accuracy of the model in estimating crowd size. however, these models require large computational costs due to additional calculations, resulting in an impractically slow inference speed for real-world applications. in this paper, we propose a fast, efficient, and robust crowd counting model called condensed network or connet. we utilize a composite technique composed of multiple compression methods to reduce the number of parameters of our proposed model. connet attains counting accuracy on par with state-of-the-art crowd counting methods on benchmark datasets featuring indoor scenes, while significantly reducing parameter count and increasing inference speed. moreover, connet still performs accurately even with extreme changes in lighting conditions, image resolutions, and camera orientations. our smallest model connet-04 has 61.0x less parameters and is at most 9.0x faster than the baseline approach. our code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/mikatej/connet.",AB_0408
"since the number of drugs based on natural products (nps) represents a large source of novel pharmacological entities, nps have acquired significance in drug discovery. peru is considered a megadiverse country with many endemic species of plants, terrestrial, and marine animals, and microorganisms. nps databases have a major impact on drug discovery development. for this reason, several countries such as mexico, brazil, india, and china have initiatives to assemble and maintain nps databases that are representative of their diversity and ethnopharmacological usage. we describe the assembly, curation, and chemoinformatic evaluation of the content and coverage in chemical space, as well as the physicochemical attributes and chemical diversity of the initial version of the peruvian natural products database (perunpdb), which contains 280 natural products. access to perunpdb is available for free (https:// perun pdb. com. pe/). the perunpdb's collection is intended to be used in a variety of tasks, such as virtual screening campaigns against various disease targets or biological endpoints. this emphasizes the significance of biodiversity protection both directly and indirectly on human health.",AB_0408
"amelogenesis imperfecta (ai) is a heterogeneous group of genetic rare diseases disrupting enamel development (smith et al., front physiol, 2017a, 8, 333). the clinical enamel phenotypes can be described as hypoplastic, hypomineralized or hypomature and serve as a basis, together with the mode of inheritance, to witkop's classification (witkop, j oral pathol, 1988, 17, 547-553). ai can be described in isolation or associated with others symptoms in syndromes. its occurrence was estimated to range from 1/700 to 1/14,000. more than 70 genes have currently been identified as causative. objectives: we analyzed using next-generation sequencing (ngs) a heterogeneous cohort of ai patients in order to determine the molecular etiology of ai and to improve diagnosis and disease management. methods: individuals presenting with so called isolated or syndromic ai were enrolled and examined at the reference centre for rare oral and dental diseases (o-rares) using d4/phenodent protocol (www.phenodent.org). families gave written informed consents for both phenotyping and molecular analysis and diagnosis using a dedicated ngs panel named genodent. this panel explores currently simultaneously 567 genes. the study is registered under nct01746121 and nct02397824 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/). results: genodent obtained a 60% diagnostic rate. we reported genetics results for 221 persons divided between 115 ai index cases and their 106 associated relatives from a total of 111 families. from this index cohort, 73% were diagnosed with non-syndromic amelogenesis imperfecta and 27% with syndromic amelogenesis imperfecta. each individual was classified according to the ai phenotype. type i hypoplastic ai represented 61 individuals (53%), type ii hypomature ai affected 31 individuals (27%), type iii hypomineralized ai was diagnosed in 18 individuals (16%) and type iv hypoplastic-hypomature ai with taurodontism concerned 5 individuals (4%). we validated the genetic diagnosis, with class 4 (likely pathogenic) or class 5 (pathogenic) variants, for 81% of the cohort, and identified candidate variants (variant of uncertain significance or vus) for 19% of index cases. among the 151 sequenced variants, 47 are newly reported and classified as class 4 or 5. the most frequently discovered genotypes were associated with mmp20 and fam83h for isolated ai. fam20a and ltbp3 genes were the most frequent genes identified for syndromic ai. patients negative to the panel were resolved with exome sequencing elucidating for example the gene involved ie acp4 or digenic inheritance. conclusion: ngs genodent panel is a validated and cost-efficient technique offering new perspectives to understand underlying molecular mechanisms of ai. discovering variants in genes involved in syndromic ai (cnnm4, wdr72, fam20a . . . ) transformed patient overall care. unravelling the genetic basis of ai sheds light on witkop's ai classification.",AB_0408

"motivation: sequence alignment is a memory bound computation whose performance in modern systems is limited by the memory bandwidth bottleneck. processing-in-memory (pim) architectures alleviate this bottleneck by providing the memory with computing competencies. we propose alignment-in-memory (aim), a framework for high throughput sequence alignment using pim, and evaluate it on upmem, the first publicly available general-purpose programmable pim system.results: our evaluation shows that a real pim system can substantially outperform server-grade multi-threaded cpu systems running at full-scale when performing sequence alignment for a variety of algorithms, read lengths, and edit distance thresholds. we hope that our findings inspire more work on creating and accelerating bioinformatics algorithms for such real pim systems.availability and implementation: our code is available at https://github.com/safaad/aim.",AB_0408
"purposegenetic studies of multiple sclerosis (ms) susceptibility and severity have focused on populations of european ancestry. studying ms genetics in other ancestral groups is necessary to determine the generalisability of these findings. the genetic association study in individuals from diverse ancestral backgrounds with multiple sclerosis (adams) project aims to gather genetic and phenotypic data on a large cohort of ancestrally-diverse individuals with ms living in the uk.participantsadults with self-reported ms from diverse ancestral backgrounds. recruitment is via clinical sites, online (https://app.mantal.co.uk/adams) or the uk ms register. we are collecting demographic and phenotypic data using a baseline questionnaire and subsequent healthcare record linkage. we are collecting dna from participants using saliva kits (oragene-600) and genotyping using the illumina global screening array v.3.findings to dateas of 3 january 2023, we have recruited 682 participants (n=446 online, n=55 via sites, n=181 via the uk ms register). of this initial cohort, 71.2% of participants are female, with a median age of 44.9 years at recruitment. over 60% of the cohort are non-white british, with 23.5% identifying as asian or asian british, 16.2% as black, african, caribbean or black british and 20.9% identifying as having mixed or other backgrounds. the median age at first symptom is 28 years, and median age at diagnosis is 32 years. 76.8% have relapsing-remitting ms, and 13.5% have secondary progressive ms.future plansrecruitment will continue over the next 10 years. genotyping and genetic data quality control are ongoing. within the next 3 years, we aim to perform initial genetic analyses of susceptibility and severity with a view to replicating the findings from european-ancestry studies. in the long term, genetic data will be combined with other datasets to further cross-ancestry genetic discoveries.",AB_0408
"introductionit is known that only a limited proportion of developed clinical prediction models (cpms) are implemented and/or used in clinical practice. this may result in a large amount of research waste, even when considering that some cpms may demonstrate poor performance. cross-sectional estimates of the numbers of cpms that have been developed, validated, evaluated for impact or utilized in practice, have been made in specific medical fields, but studies across multiple fields and studies following up the fate of cpms are lacking.methods and analysiswe have conducted a systematic search for prediction model studies published between january 1995 and december 2020 using the pubmed and embase databases, applying a validated search strategy. taking random samples for every calendar year, abstracts and articles were screened until a target of 100 cpm development studies were identified. next, we will perform a forward citation search of the resulting cpm development article cohort to identify articles on external validation, impact assessment or implementation of those cpms. we will also invite the authors of the development studies to complete an online survey to track implementation and clinical utilization of the cpms.we will conduct a descriptive synthesis of the included studies, using data from the forward citation search and online survey to quantify the proportion of developed models that are validated, assessed for their impact, implemented and/or used in patient care. we will conduct time-to-event analysis using kaplan-meier plots.methods and analysiswe have conducted a systematic search for prediction model studies published between january 1995 and december 2020 using the pubmed and embase databases, applying a validated search strategy. taking random samples for every calendar year, abstracts and articles were screened until a target of 100 cpm development studies were identified. next, we will perform a forward citation search of the resulting cpm development article cohort to identify articles on external validation, impact assessment or implementation of those cpms. we will also invite the authors of the development studies to complete an online survey to track implementation and clinical utilization of the cpms.we will conduct a descriptive synthesis of the included studies, using data from the forward citation search and online survey to quantify the proportion of developed models that are validated, assessed for their impact, implemented and/or used in patient care. we will conduct time-to-event analysis using kaplan-meier plots.ethics and disseminationno patient data are involved in the research. most information will be extracted from published articles. we request written informed consent from the survey respondents. results will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at international conferences.osf registration(https://osf.io/nj8s9).",AB_0408
"noninvasive medical neuroimaging has yielded many discoveries about the brain connectivity. several substantial techniques mapping morphological, structural and functional brain connectivities were developed to create a comprehensive road map of neuronal activities in the human brain -namely brain graph. relying on its non-euclidean data type, graph neural network (gnn) provides a clever way of learning the deep graph structure and it is rapidly becoming the state-of-the-art leading to enhanced performance in various network neuroscience tasks. here we review current gnn-based methods, highlighting the ways that they have been used in several applications related to brain graphs such as missing brain graph synthesis and disease classification. we conclude by charting a path toward a better application of gnn models in network neuroscience field for neurological disorder diagnosis and population graph integration. the list of papers cited in our work is available at https://github.com/basiralab/gnns-in-network-neuroscience.",AB_0408
