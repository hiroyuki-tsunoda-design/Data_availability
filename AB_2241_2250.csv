"single-cell rna-sequencing (scrna-seq) has emerged as a powerful technique for studying gene expression patterns at the single-cell level. inferring gene regulatory networks (grns) from scrna-seq data provides insight into cellular phenotypes from the genomic level. however, the high sparsity, noise and dropout events inherent in scrna-seq data present challenges for grn inference. in recent years, the dramatic increase in data on experimentally validated transcription factors binding to dna has made it possible to infer grns by supervised methods. in this study, we address the problem of grn inference by framing it as a graph link prediction task. in this paper, we propose a novel framework called gnnlink, which leverages known grns to deduce the potential regulatory interdependencies between genes. first, we preprocess the raw scrna-seq data. then, we introduce a graph convolutional network-based interaction graph encoder to effectively refine gene features by capturing interdependencies between nodes in the network. finally, the inference of grn is obtained by performing matrix completion operation on node features. the features obtained from model training can be applied to downstream tasks such as measuring similarity and inferring causality between gene pairs. to evaluate the performance of gnnlink, we compare it with six existing grn reconstruction methods using seven scrna-seq datasets. these datasets encompass diverse ground truth networks, including functional interaction networks, loss of function/gain of function data, non-specific chip-seq data and cell-type-specific chip-seq data. our experimental results demonstrate that gnnlink achieves comparable or superior performance across these datasets, showcasing its robustness and accuracy. furthermore, we observe consistent performance across datasets of varying scales. for reproducibility, we provide the data and source code of gnnlink on our github repository: https://github.com/sdesignates/gnnlink.",AB_0225
"single-cell clustering is a critical step in biological downstream analysis. the clustering performance could be effectively improved by extracting cell-type-specific genes. the state-of-the-art feature selection methods usually calculate the importance of a single gene without considering the information contained in the gene expression distribution. moreover, these methods ignore the intrinsic expression patterns of genes and heterogeneity within groups of different mean expression levels. in this work, we present a feature selection method based on gene expression decomposition (feed) of scrna-seq data, which selects informative genes to enhance clustering performance. first, the expression levels of genes are decomposed into multiple gaussian components. then, a novel gene correlation calculation method is proposed to measure the relationship between genes from the perspective of distribution. finally, a permutation-based approach is proposed to determine the threshold of gene importance to obtain marker gene subsets. compared with state-of-the-art feature selection methods, applying feed on various scrna-seq datasets including large datasets followed by different common clustering algorithms results in significant improvements in the accuracy of cell-type identification. the source codes for feed are freely available at https://github.com/genemine/feed.",AB_0225
"motive in recent years, the end-to-end deep learning method for single-chain protein structure prediction has achieved high accuracy. for example, the state-of-the-art method alphafold, developed by google, has largely increased the accuracy of protein structure predictions to near experimental accuracy in some of the cases. at the same time, there are few methods that can evaluate the quality of protein complexes at the residue level. in particular, evaluating the quality of residues at the interface of protein complexes can lead to a wide range of applications, such as protein function analysis and drug design. in this paper, we introduce a new deep graph neural network-based method complexqa, to evaluate the local quality of interfaces for protein complexes by utilizing the residual structural information in 3d space and the sequence-level constraints. results: we benchmark our method to other state-d -art quality assessment approaches on the haf2 and dbm55-af2 datasets (high-quality structural models predicted by alpha multimer), and the bm5 docking dataset. the experimental results show that our proposed method achieves better or similar performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods, especially on difficult targets which only contain a few acceptable models. our method is able to suggest a score for each interfac e residue, which demonstrates a powerful assessment tool for the ever-increasing number of protein complexes. availability: https://github.com/cao-labs/complexqa.git. contact: caora@plu.edu",AB_0225
"reconstructing the full-length sequence of extrachromosomal circular dna (eccdna) from short sequencing reads has proved challenging given the similarity of eccdnas and their corresponding linear dnas. previous sequencing methods were unable to achieve high-throughput detection of full-length eccdnas. herein, a novel algorithm was developed, called full-length eccdna detection (fled), to reconstruct the sequence of eccdnas based on the strategy that combined rolling circle amplification and nanopore long-reads sequencing technology. seven human epithelial and cancer cell line samples were analyzed by fled and over 5000 full-length eccdnas were identified per sample. the structures of identified eccdnas were validated by both polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sanger sequencing. compared to other published nanopore-based eccdna detectors, fled exhibited higher sensitivity. in cancer cell lines, the genes overlapped with eccdna regions were enriched in cancer-related pathways and cis-regulatory elements can be predicted in the upstream or downstream of intact genes on eccdna molecules, and the expressions of these cancer-related genes were dysregulated in tumor cell lines, indicating the regulatory potency of eccdnas in biological processes. the proposed method takes advantage of nanopore long reads and enables unbiased reconstruction of full-length eccdna sequences. fled is implemented using python3 which is freely available on github (https://github.com/fuyuli/fled).",AB_0225
"development of robust and effective strategies for synthesizing new compounds, drug targeting and constructing genome-scale metabolic models (gems) requires a deep understanding of the underlying biological processes. a critical step in achieving this goal is accurately identifying the categories of pathways in which a compound participated. however, current machine learning-based methods often overlook the multifaceted nature of compounds, resulting in inaccurate pathway predictions. therefore, we present a novel framework on multi-view multi-label learning for metabolic pathway inference, hereby named mvml-mpi. first, mvml-mpi learns the distinct compound representations in parallel with corresponding compound encoders to fully extract features. subsequently, we propose an attention-based mechanism that offers a fusion module to complement these multi-view representations. as a result, mvml-mpi accurately represents and effectively captures the complex relationship between compounds and metabolic pathways and distinguishes itself from current machine learning-based methods. in experiments conducted on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathways dataset, mvml-mpi outperformed state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the superiority of mvml-mpi and its potential to utilize the field of metabolic pathway design, which can aid in optimizing drug-like compounds and facilitating the development of gems. the code and data underlying this article are freely available at https://github.com/guofei-tju/mvml-mpi. contact: jtang@cse.sc.edu, guofei@csu.edu.com or wuxi_dyj@csj.uestc.edu.cn",AB_0225
"drug combination therapy has gradually become a promising treatment strategy for complex or co-existing diseases. as drug-drug interactions (ddis) may cause unexpected adverse drug reactions, ddi prediction is an important task in pharmacology and clinical applications. recently, researchers have proposed several deep learning methods to predict ddis. however, these methods mainly exploit the chemical or biological features of drugs, which is insufficient and limits the performances of ddi prediction. here, we propose a new deep multimodal feature fusion framework for ddi prediction, dmfddi, which fuses drug molecular graph, ddi network and the biochemical similarity features of drugs to predict ddis. to fully extract drug molecular structure, we introduce an attention-gated graph neural network for capturing the global features of the molecular graph and the local features of each atom. a sparse graph convolution network is introduced to learn the topological structure information of the ddi network. in the multimodal feature fusion module, an attention mechanism is used to efficiently fuse different features. to validate the performance of dmfddi, we compare it with 10 state-of-the-art methods. the comparison results demonstrate that dmfddi achieves better performance in ddi prediction. our method dmfddi is implemented in python using the pytorch machine-learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/dhudeblab/dmfddi.git.",AB_0225
"the simultaneous use of two or more drugs due to multi-disease comorbidity continues to increase, which may cause adverse reactions between drugs that seriously threaten public health. therefore, the prediction of drug-drug interaction (ddi) has become a hot topic not only in clinics but also in bioinformatics. in this study, we propose a novel pre-trained heterogeneous graph neural network (hgnn) model named hetddi, which aggregates the structural information in drug molecule graphs and rich semantic information in biomedical knowledge graph to predict ddis. in hetddi, we first initialize the parameters of the model with different pre-training methods. then we apply the pre-trained hgnn to learn the feature representation of drugs from multi-source heterogeneous information, which can more effectively utilize drugs' internal structure and abundant external biomedical knowledge, thus leading to better ddi prediction. we evaluate our model on three ddi prediction tasks (binary-class, multi-class and multi-label) with three datasets and further assess its performance on three scenarios (s1, s2 and s3). the results show that the accuracy of hetddi can achieve 98.82% in the binary-class task, 98.13% in the multi-class task and 96.66% in the multi-label one on s1, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by at least 2%. on s2 and s3, our method also achieves exciting performance. furthermore, the case studies confirm that our model performs well in predicting unknown ddis. source codes are available at https://github.com/linslab/hetddi.",AB_0225
"the identification of viruses from negative staining transmission electron microscopy (tem) images has mainly depended on experienced experts. recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled virus recognition using deep learning techniques. however, most of the existing methods only perform virus classification or semantic segmentation, and few studies have addressed the challenge of virus instance segmentation in tem images. in this paper, we focus on the instance segmentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (sars-cov-2) and other respiratory viruses and provide experts with more effective information about viruses. we propose an effective virus instance segmentation network based on the you only look at coefficients backbone, which integrates the swin transformer, dense connections and the coordinate-spatial attention mechanism, to identify sars-cov-2, h1n1 influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, herpes simplex virus-1, human adenovirus type 5 and vaccinia virus. we also provide a public tem virus dataset and conduct extensive comparative experiments. our method achieves a mean average precision score of 83.8 and f1 score of 0.920, outperforming other state-of-the-art instance segmentation algorithms. the proposed automated method provides virologists with an effective approach for recognizing and identifying sars-cov-2 and assisting in the diagnosis of viruses. our dataset and code are accessible at https://github.com/xiaochihnu/virus-instance-segmentation-transformer-network.",AB_0225
"the emergence of single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) technology has revolutionized the identification of cell types and the study of cellular states at a single-cell level. despite its significant potential, scrna-seq data analysis is plagued by the issue of missing values. many existing imputation methods rely on simplistic data distribution assumptions while ignoring the intrinsic gene expression distribution specific to cells. this work presents a novel deep-learning model, named scmultigan, for scrna-seq imputation, which utilizes multiple collaborative generative adversarial networks (gan). unlike traditional gan-based imputation methods that generate missing values based on random noises, scmultigan employs a two-stage training process and utilizes multiple gans to achieve cell-specific imputation. experimental results show the efficacy of scmultigan in imputation accuracy, cell clustering, differential gene expression analysis and trajectory analysis, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques. additionally, scmultigan is scalable to large scrna-seq datasets and consistently performs well across sequencing platforms. the scmultigan code is freely available at https://github.com/galaxy8172/scmultigan.",AB_0225
"protein remote homology detection is essential for structure prediction, function prediction, disease mechanism understanding, etc. the remote homology relationship depends on multiple protein properties, such as structural information and local sequence patterns. previous studies have shown the challenges for predicting remote homology relationship by protein features at sequence level (e.g. position-specific score matrix). protein motifs have been used in structure and function analysis due to their unique sequence patterns and implied structural information. therefore, designing a usable architecture to fuse multiple protein properties based on motifs is urgently needed to improve protein remote homology detection performance. to make full use of the characteristics of motifs, we employed the language model called the protein cubic language model (pclm). it combines multiple properties by constructing a motif-based neural network. based on the pclm, we proposed a predictor called prehom-pclm by extracting and fusing multiple motif features for protein remote homology detection. prehom-pclm outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods on the test set and independent test set. experimental results further prove the effectiveness of multiple features fused by prehom-pclm for remote homology detection. furthermore, the protein features derived from the prehom-pclm show strong discriminative power for proteins from different structural classes in the high-dimensional space. availability and implementation: http://bliulab.net/prehom-pclm.",AB_0225
