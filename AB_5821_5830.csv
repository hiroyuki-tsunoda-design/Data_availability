"background: advance care planning (acp) improves patient-provider communication and aligns care to patient values, preferences, and goals. within a multisite meta-network learning and research center acp study, one health system deployed an electronic health record (ehr) notification and algorithm to alert providers about patients potentially appropriate for acp and the clinical study.objective: the aim of the study is to describe the implementation and usage of an ehr notification for referring patients to an acp study, evaluate the association of notifications with study referrals and engagement in acp, and assess provider interactions with and perspectives on the notifications.methods: a secondary analysis assessed provider usage and their response to the notification (eg, acknowledge, dismiss, or engage patient in acp conversation and refer patient to the clinical study). we evaluated all patients identified by the ehr algorithm during the meta-network learning and research center acp study. descriptive statistics compared patients referred to the study to those who were not referred to the study. health care utilization, hospice referrals, and mortality as well as documentation and billing for acp and related legal documents are reported. we evaluated associations between notifications with provider actions (ie, referral to study, acp not documentation, and acp billing). provider free-text comments in the notifications were summarized qualitatively. providers were surveyed on their satisfaction with the notification.results: among the 2877 patients identified by the ehr algorithm over 20 months, 17,047 unique notifications were presented to 45 providers in 6 clinics, who then referred 290 (10%) patients. providers had a median of 269 (iqr 65-552) total notifications, and patients had a median of 4 (iqr 2-8). patients with more (over 5) notifications were less likely to be referred to the study than those with fewer notifications (57/1092, 5.2% vs 233/1785, 13.1%; p<.001). the most common free-text comment on the notification was lack of time. providers who referred patients to the study were more likely to document acp and submit acp billing codes (p<.001). in the survey, 11 providers would recommend the notification (n=7, 64%); however, the notification impacted clinical workflow (n=9, 82%) and was difficult to navigate (n=6, 55%).conclusions: an ehr notification can be implemented to remind providers to both perform acp conversations and refer patients to a clinical study. there were diminishing returns after the fifth ehr notification where additional notifications did not lead to more trial referrals, acp documentation, or acp billing. creation and optimization of ehr notifications for study referrals and acp should consider the provider user, their workflow, and alert fatigue to improve implementation and adoption.trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct03577002; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03577002",AB_0583
"two new ctenacanthiform sharks representing two families, ctenacanthidae and heslerodidae, have been identified from the middle to late mississippian marine sediments from mammoth cave national park, kentucky, and two late mississippian marine horizons in northern alabama. the ctenacanthid, troglocladodus trimblei, gen. et sp. nov., is known from isolated teeth from the middle mississippian st. louis formation and ste. genevieve formation of mammoth cave and the late mississippian bangor limestone of northern alabama. troglocladodus gen. nov. is characterized by broad median cusps, pronounced longitudinal cristae, multiple intermediate cusps, and labiolingually shortened tooth bases. the heslerodid, glikmanius careforum sp. nov., is known from isolated teeth and visceral arches from the middle mississippian st. louis formation and ste. genevieve formation and the late mississippian haney formation, a hartselle sandstone-equivalent shale interval, and bangor limestone. glikmanius careforum sp. nov. has proportionately distinct teeth among species of glikmanius, with more robust and shorter cusps. the palatoquadrate of g. careforum has a short palatine ramus, otic process that is dorsoventrally deep and less expanded antero-posteriorly similar to heslerodus and dracopristis, and an elongated quadrate process like heslerodus. the meckel's cartilage is less dorsoventrally deep than dracopristis. these two new ctenacanth taxa add important information on the diversity of ctenacanthiformes suggesting three major lineages within the order. ctenacanths have a rich fossil history from the late devonian to the middle permian evolving a variety of tooth types and small to large body sizes.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:5b580862-0a90-4255-9eea-57a240a7028d",AB_0583
"nine crinoids are described from the wooster shale member of the cuyahoga formation from wayne and ashland counties, ohio, usa. identifiable elements of the fauna include five camerate crinoids, one flexible crinoid, and three other eucladid crinoids. five new species are described, including cactocrinus woosterensis n. sp., cusacrinus brushi n. sp., agaricocrinus murphyi n. sp., decadocrinus laevis n. sp., and decadocrinus inordinatus n. sp. overall, the distribution of crinoid clades in the wooster shale is similar to that of the stratigraphically lower meadville shale member of the cuyahoga formation, although less diverse and with only one species (cyathocrinites simplex) in common. many of the wooster shale member crinoids are completely or partially preserved with siderite either in nodules or within siderite beds. these crinoids are commonly preserved in trauma postures, which is characteristic of burial in episodic high turbulence events. the paleoenvironments and taxa of the two cuyahoga formation crinoid faunas more closely resemble visean faunas in siliciclastic settings than typical carbonate faunas of the tournaisian.uuid: http://zoobank.org/2d2678e1-2367-4429-bea0-a64cd020e98c",AB_0583
"background: limited research evidence exists on the effects of red meat on gut microbiota in human adults.objective: we aim to assess the effects of consuming a healthy u.s.-style dietary pattern (hdp), without or with unprocessed or processed lean red meats, on gut microbiota and fecal short-chain fatty acid (scfa) levels in healthy young adults. secondary outcomes are cardiovascular disease risk factors.methods: we conducted a randomized, controlled, crossover trial with 3 3-wk dietary interventions, each separated by a 5-wk washout period with habitual dietary intake. nineteen participants (8 females, age 26 & plusmn; 4 y old, bmi 23 & plusmn; 3 kg/m2) consumed 3 study diets in random order: 1) healthy lacto-ovo vegetarian diet (lov); 2) lov plus 3 ounces/d of cooked unprocessed lean red meat (urm); and 3) lov plus 3 ounces/d of cooked processed lean red meat (prm). fecal and fasting blood samples were collected before and during the last 2 wk of each intervention. we measured fecal bacterial community structure using 16s rrna amplicon sequencing (v4 region, primers 515f-806r). community diversity, structure, and taxonomic composition were computed using mothur v.1.44.3.results: the addition of unprocessed or processed lean red meats to a lov hdp did not influence short-term changes in bacterial taxonomic composition. independent of red meat intake, the hdp led to changes in 23 bacteria; reductions in serum total cholesterol (tc) and ldl-c concentrations; but no changes in fecal scfa, serum triglycerides, hdl-c concentrations, tc/hdl-c ratio, or blood pressures. with data from all 3 diet interventions combined, changes in some bacteria were associated with improvements in tc, ldl-c, triglycerides, and hdl-c concentrations, and tc/hdl-c ratio.conclusions: healthy young adults who adopt an hdp that may be vegetarian or omnivorous, including lean red meat, experience shortterm changes in gut microbial composition, which associate with improvements in multiple lipid-related cardiovascular risk factors. nct03885544, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03885544?cond=nct03885544 & draw=2 & rank=1",AB_0583

"deep learning has revolutionized many scene perception tasks over the past decade. some of these improvements can be attributed to the development of large labeled datasets. the creation of such datasets can be an expensive, time-consuming, and imperfect process. to address these issues, we introduce geosynth, a diverse photorealistic synthetic dataset for indoor scene understanding tasks. each geosynth exemplar contains rich labels including segmentation, geometry, camera parameters, surface material, lighting, and more. we demonstrate that supplementing real training data with geosynth can significantly improve network performance on perception tasks, like semantic segmentation. a subset of our dataset will be made publicly available at https://github.com/geomagical/geosynth.",AB_0583
"we present pace, a novel method for modifying motion-captured virtual agents to interact with and move throughout dense, cluttered 3d scenes. our approach changes a given motion sequence of a virtual agent as needed to adjust to the obstacles and objects in the environment. we first take the individual frames of the motion sequence most important for modeling interactions with the scene and pair them with the relevant scene geometry, obstacles, and semantics such that interactions in the agents motion match the affordances of the scene (e.g., standing on a floor or sitting in a chair). we then optimize the motion of the human by directly altering the high-dof pose at each frame in the motion to better account for the unique geometric constraints of the scene. our formulation uses novel loss functions that maintain a realistic flow and natural-looking motion. we compare our method with prior motion generating techniques and highlight the benefits of our method with a perceptual study and physical plausibility metrics. human raters preferred our method over the prior approaches. specifically, they preferred our method 57.1% of the time versus the state-of-the-art method using existing motions, and 81.0% of the time versus a state-of-the-art motion synthesis method. additionally, our method performs significantly higher on established physical plausibility and interaction metrics. specifically, we outperform competing methods by over 1.2% in terms of the non-collision metric and by over 18% in terms of the contact metric. we have integrated our interactive system with microsoft hololens and demonstrate its benefits in real-world indoor scenes. our project website is available at https://gamma.mnd.edu/pace/",AB_0583
"in recent years, there have been major strides in the safety verification of machine learning models such as neural networks and tree ensembles. however, fuzzy decision trees (fdt), also called soft or differentiable decision trees, are yet unstudied in the context of verification. they present unique verification challenges resulting from multiplications of input values; in the simplest case with a piecewise-linear splitting function, an fdt is piecewise-polynomial with degree up to the depth of the tree. we propose an abstraction-refinement algorithm for verification of properties of fdts. we show that the problem is np-complete, like many other machine learning verification problems, and that our algorithm is complete in a finite precision setting. we benchmark on a selection of public data sets against an off-the-shelf smt solver and a baseline variation of our algorithm that uses a refinement strategy from similar methods for neural network verification, finding the proposed method to be the fastest. code for our algorithm along with our experiments and demos are available on github at https://github.com/autonlab/fdt_verification.",AB_0583
"this study uses a spring-block model and rate and state friction to simulate experiments conducted in a double direct-shear apparatus on carbonate fault gouge (scuderi et al., 2017, https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.08.009) and on shale bearing rock (scuderi & collettini, 2018, https://doi. org/10.1029/2018jb016084). both sets of experiments used the same loading protocol and injected pore fluid under creep conditions. when velocity strengthening rate and state friction is used to simulate the experiments on the carbonate fault gouge the results agree well with the observed onset of tertiary creep in the experiment. thus, the simulation reinforces the observation that pore fluid injection can induce rapid slip even when the friction relation is velocity strengthening. the rate and state framework provides an interpretation alternative to the standard one of the mohr's circle moving to the left as pressure increases. in the rate and state framework, the friction coefficient must increase with pore pressure increase. the shale has a low nominal friction coefficient (0.28) and is much more velocity strengthening than the carbonate. the simulation agrees with the observations that increases in pore pressure induce an increase in slip velocity but the magnitudes reach only about 100 microns/s by the end of the experiment. the simulation for the shale also agrees well with the magnitude of the observed displacement at the end of the experiment but observed displacement is increasing much more rapidly the calculated. although the calculations agree well with features of the observations near failure, the overall curves of displacement and velocity are significantly different.",AB_0583
"research highlight: seibold, s., weisser, w., ambarli, d., gossner, m. m., mori, a., cadotte, m., hagge, j., bassler, c. & thorn, s. (2022). drivers of community assembly change during succession in wood-decomposing beetle communities. journal of animal ecology, https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13843. paradigms of succession and its drivers have largely developed from systems relying on living plants. a substantial portion of terrestrial biodiversity and biomass exists in detrital systems that rely on dead organic matter, yet successional patterns in detrital systems have received far less attention. in particular, deadwood significantly contributes to forest ecosystem nutrient cycling and storage and represents a relatively long- lived detrital system in which to study patterns of succession. seibold et al. examined successional patterns of deadwood beetle communities over 8 year s in a large- scale experiment that included 379 logs from 13 different tree species in 30 forest stands in three regions of germany. they predicted that deadwood beetle communities would initially differ among deadwood tree species, across space, and with climatic differences but would become more similar over time as deadwood decomposed and characteristics of remaining habitat become more homogeneous. however, seibold et al. predicted that beetle communities would become increasingly different across space along dead- wood succession if late successional species were weaker dispersers than early successional species. surprisingly, beetle communities became more dissimilar over time contrary to predictions. but, as predicted, increasing phylogenetic distance among tree species led to increasingly dissimilar deadwood beetle communities. lastly, differences across space, forest structure and climate led to different deadwood beetle communities, but these effects remained constant over time. these results suggest that deadwood succession is influenced by both deterministic and stochastic pro- cesses and that stochastic processes may be increasingly important in late succes- sional stages. seibold et al. reveal important drivers of detrital successional patterns in deadwood that indicate that deadwood beetle biodiversity can be promoted via main- taining a diversity of deadwood decay stages across a large phylogenetic diversity of trees species and structurally diverse forests. future studies that test the mechanisms driving these patterns and whether these results hold for other saproxylic organisms will help inform forest conservation and management strategies.",AB_0583
