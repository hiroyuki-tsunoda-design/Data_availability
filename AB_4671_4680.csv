"transposable element monitoring with long-reads (tremolo) is a new software that combines assembly- and mapping-based approaches to robustly detect genetic elements called transposable elements (tes). using high- or low-quality genome assemblies, tremolo can detect most te insertions and deletions and estimate their allele frequency in populations. benchmarking with simulated data revealed that tremolo outperforms other state-of-the-art computational tools. te detection and frequency estimation by tremolo were validated using simulated and experimental datasets. therefore, tremolo is a comprehensive and suitable tool to accurately study te dynamics. tremolo is available under gnu gpl3.0 at https://github.com/drosophila genomeevolution/tremolo.",AB_0468
"introduction placenta accreta spectrum (pas) disorder is a life-threatening condition that may result in serious maternal complications, including mortality. the placenta which is pathologically adherent to the uterine wall, places individuals at high risk of major haemorrhage during the third stage of labour. current research reports on pas disorder outcomes have highly variable levels of information, which is therefore difficult for investigators to aggregate to inform practice. there is an urgent need to harmonise data collection in prospective studies to identify and implement best practices for management. one approach to standardise outcomes across any health area via the use of core outcome sets (coss), which are consensus-derived standardised sets of outcomes that all studies for a particular condition should measure and report. this protocol outlines the steps for developing a cos for pas disorder (copas). methods and analysis this protocol outlines steps for the creation of copas. the first step, a systematic review, will identify all reported outcomes in the scientific literature. the second step will use qualitative one-on-one interviews to identify additional outcomes identified as important by patients and healthcare professionals that are not reported in the published literature. outcomes from the first two steps will be combined to form an outcome inventory. this outcome inventory will inform the third step which is a delphi survey that encourages agreement between patients and healthcare professionals on which outcomes are most important for inclusion in the cos. the fourth step, a consensus group meeting of representative participants, will finalise outcomes for inclusion in the pas disorder cos. ethics and dissemination this study has obtained research ethics board approval from sunnybrook health sciences centre (#2338, #1488). we will aim to publish the study findings in an international peer-reviewed obgyn journal. registration details comet core outcome set registration: https://www.comet-initiative.org/studies/details/1127. prospero registration number crd42020173426.",AB_0468
"this report describes the artifacts of the dissecting american fuzzy lop - a fuzzbench evaluation paper. the artifacts are available online at https://github.com/eurecom-s3/dissecting_afl and archived at https://doi. org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21401280. american fuzzy lop (afl) consists of the produced code, the setup to run the experiments in fuzzbench, and the generated reports. we claim the functional badge as the patches to afl are easy to enable and the experiments are easy to run thanks to the fuzzbench service, but the evaluations are self-contained and the modifications to afl are as is. for the purpose of reproducing the experiments, no particular skills are needed as the process is straightforward and described in https://google.github.io/ fuzzbench/getting-started/adding-a- new- fuzzer/#requesting- an- experiment.",AB_0468
"bacterial secondary metabolites, synthesized by enzymes encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (bgcs), can underlie microbi-ome homeostasis and serve as commercialized products, which have historically been mined from a select group of taxa. while evolutionary approaches have proven beneficial for prioritizing bgcs for experimental characterization efforts to uncover new natural products, dedicated bioinformatics tools designed for comparative and evolutionary analysis of bgcs within focal taxa are limited. we thus developed lineage specific analysis of bgcs (lsabgc; https://github.com/kalan-lab/lsabgc) to aid exploration of microdiversity and evolutionary trends across homologous groupings of bgcs, gene cluster families (gcfs), in any bacterial taxa of interest. lsabgc enables rapid and direct identification of gcfs in genomes, calculates evolutionary statistics and conservation for bgc genes, and builds a framework to allow for base resolution mining of novel variants through metagenomic exploration. through application of the suite to four genera commonly found in skin microbiomes, we uncover new insights into the evolution and diversity of their bgcs. we show that the bgc of the virulence-associated carotenoid staphyloxanthin in staphylococcus aureus is ubiquitous across the genus staphylococcus. while one gcf encoding the biosynthesis of staphyloxanthin showcases evidence for plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer (hgt) between species, another gcf appears to be transmitted vertically amongst a sub- clade of skin-associated staphylococcus. further, the latter gcf, which is well conserved in s. aureus, has been lost in most staphylococcus epidermidis, which is the most common staphylococcus species on human skin and is also regarded as a commen-sal. we also identify thousands of novel single-nucleotide variants (snvs) within bgcs from the corynebacterium tuberculostearicum sp. complex, a narrow, multi-species clade that features the most prevalent corynebacterium in healthy skin microbiomes. although novel snvs were approximately 10 times as likely to correspond to synonymous changes when located in the top five percentile of conserved sites, lsabgc identified snvs that defied this trend and are predicted to underlie amino acid changes within functionally key enzymatic domains. ultimately, beyond supporting evolutionary investigations of bgcs, lsabgc also provides important func-tionalities to aid efforts for the discovery or directed modification of natural products.",AB_0468
"objectives in the first full year of the covid-19 pandemic (2020), south asians living in the greater toronto and hamilton area (gtha) and greater vancouver area (gva) experienced specific barriers to accessing sars-cov-2 testing and reliable health information. however, between june 2021 and february 2022, the proportion of people having received at least one covid-19 vaccine dose was higher among this group (96%) than among individuals who were not visible minorities (93%). a better understanding of successful approaches and the challenges experienced by those who remain unvaccinated among this highly vaccinated group may improve public health outreach in subsequent waves of the current pandemic or for future pandemic planning. using qualitative methods, we sought to explore the perceptions of covid-19 risk, vaccine access, uptake and confidence among south asians living in canada. design semistructured interviews conducted with 25 participants analysed using thematic analysis. throughout this process, we held frequent discussions with members of the study's advisory group to guide data collection (community engagement, recruitment and data analysis). setting communities of the gtha and gva with interviews conducted virtually over zoom or telephone. participants 25 participants (15 from ontario and 10 from british columbia) were interviewed between july 2021 and january 2022. 10 individuals were community members, 9 were advocacy group leaders and 6 were public health staff. results access to and confidence in the covid-19 vaccine was impacted by individual risk perceptions; sources of trusted information (ethnic and non-ethnic); impact of covid-19 and the pandemic on individuals, families and society; and experiences with covid-19 mandates and policies (including temporal and generational differences). approaches that include community-level awareness and tailored outreach (language and cultural context) were considered successful. conclusions understanding factors and developing strategies that build vaccine confidence and improve access can guide approaches that increase vaccine acceptance in the current and future pandemics. visual abstract can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ixdnjj9ssc3hxcllzxp0qa9dhhh-7uwb/view",AB_0468
"objective the treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations study (tobas) is a pragmatic study that includes 2 randomized trials and registries of treated or conservatively managed patients. the authors report the results of the surgical registry.methods tobas patients are managed according to an algorithm that combines clinical judgment and randomized allocation. for patients considered for curative treatment, clinicians selected from surgery, endovascular therapy, or radiation therapy as the primary curative method, and whether observation was a reasonable alternative. when surgery was selected and observation was deemed unreasonable, the patient was not included in the randomized controlled trial but placed in the surgical registry. the primary outcome of the trial was mrs score > 2 at 10 years (at last follow-up for the current report). secondary outcomes include angiographic results, perioperative serious adverse events, and permanent treatment-related complications leading to mrs score > 2.results from june 2014 to may 2021, 1010 patients were recruited at 30 tobas centers. surgery was selected for 229/512 patients (44%) considered for curative treatment; 77 (34%) were included in the surgery versus observation ran-domized trial and 152 (66%) were placed in the surgical registry. surgical registry patients had 124/152 (82%) ruptured and 28/152 (18%) unruptured arteriovenous malformations (avms), with the majority categorized as low-grade spetzler-martin grade i-ii avm (118/152 [78%]). thirteen patients were excluded, leaving 139 patients for analysis. embolization was performed prior to surgery in 78/139 (56%) patients. surgical angiographic cure was obtained in 123/139 all-grade (89%, 95% ci 82%-93%) and 105/110 low-grade (95%, 95% ci 90%-98%) avm patients. at the mean follow-up of 18.1 months, 16 patients (12%, 95% ci 7%-18%) had reached the primary safety outcome of mrs score > 2, including 11/16 who had a baseline mrs score >= 3 due to previous avm rupture. serious adverse events occurred in 29 patients (21%, 95% ci 15%-28%). permanent treatment-related complications leading to mrs score > 2 occurred in 6/139 patients (4%, 95% ci 2%-9%), 5 (83%) of whom had complications due to preoperative embolization.conclusions the surgical treatment of brain avms in the tobas registry was curative in 88% of patients. the participation of more patients, surgeons, and centers in randomized trials is needed to definitively establish the role of surgery in the treatment of unruptured brain avms. clinical trial registration no.: nct02098252 (clinicaltrials.gov) https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.7.jns22813",AB_0468
"objective length of stay (los) is a contributor to costs and resource utilization. the primary goal of this study was to identify patient, clinical, surgical, and institutional variables that influence los after elective surgery for thoracolumbar degenerative pathology. the secondary objective was to examine variability in los and institutional strategies used to decrease los.methods this is a retrospective study of prospectively collected data from a multicentric cohort enrolled in the ca-nadian spine outcomes and research network (csorn) between january 2015 and october 2020 who underwent elective thoracolumbar surgery (discectomy [1 or 2 levels], laminectomy [1 or 2 levels], and posterior instrumented fusion [up to 5 levels]). prolonged los was defined as los greater than the median. logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with prolonged los for each procedure. a survey was sent to the principal investigators of the participating healthcare institutions to understand institutional practices that are used to decrease los.results a total of 3700 patients were included (967 discectomies, 1094 laminectomies, and 1639 fusions). the medi-an loss for discectomy, laminectomy, and fusion were 0.0 (iqr 1.0), 1.0 (iqr 2.0), and 4.0 (iqr 2.0) days, respectively. on multivariable analysis, predictors of prolonged los for discectomy were having more leg pain, higher oswestry dis-ability index (odi) scores, symptom duration more than 2 years, having undergone an open procedure, occurrence of an adverse event (ae), and treatment at an institution without protocols to reduce los (p < 0.05). predictors of prolonged los for laminectomy were increased age, living alone, higher odi scores, higher bmi, open procedures, longer opera-tive time, aes, and treatment at an institution without protocols to reduce los (p < 0.05). for posterior instrumented fu-sion, predictors of prolonged los were older age, living alone, more comorbidities, higher odi scores, longer operative time, aes, and treatment at an institution without protocols to reduce los (p < 0.05). the laminectomy group had the largest variability in los (sd 4.4 days, range 0-133 days). three hundred fifty-four patients (22%) had an los above the 75th percentile. ten institutions (53%) had either enhanced recovery after surgery or standardized protocols in place.conclusions among the factors identified in this study, worse baseline odi scores, experiencing aes, and treat- ment at an institution without protocols aimed at reducing los were predictive of prolonged los in all surgical groups. the laminectomy group had the largest variability in los.https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.11.spine22662",AB_0468
"labeling data is often expensive and time-consuming, especially for tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation, which require dense labeling of the image. while few-shot object detection is about training a model on novel (unseen) object classes with little data, it still requires prior training on many labeled examples of base (seen) classes. on the other hand, self-supervised methods aim at learning representations from unlabeled data which transfer well to downstream tasks such as object detection. combining few-shot and self-supervised object detection is a promising research direction. in this survey, we review and characterize the most recent approaches on few-shot and self-supervised object detection. then, we give our main takeaways and discuss future research directions. project page: https://gabrielhuang.github.io/fsod-survey/.",AB_0468
"zero-shot learning (zsl) aims at recognizing classes for which no visual sample is available at training time. to address this issue, one can rely on a semantic description of each class. a typical zsl model learns a mapping between the visual samples of seen classes and the corresponding semantic descriptions, in order to do the same on unseen classes at test time. state of the art approaches rely on generative models that synthesize visual features from the prototype of a class, such that a classifier can then be learned in a supervised manner. however, these approaches are usually biased towards seen classes whose visual instances are the only one that can be matched to a given class prototype. we propose a regularization method that can be applied to any conditional generative-based zsl method, by leveraging only the semantic class prototypes. it learns to synthesize discriminative features for possible semantic description that are not available at training time, that is the unseen ones. the approach is evaluated for zsl and gzsl on four datasets commonly used in the literature, either in inductive or transductive settings, with results on-par or above state of the art approaches. the code is available at https://github.com/hanouticelina/lsa-zsl.",AB_0468
"background plant architecture can influence crop yield and quality. manual extraction of architectural traits is, however, time-consuming, tedious, and error prone. the trait estimation from 3d data addresses occlusion issues with the availability of depth information while deep learning approaches enable learning features without manual design. the goal of this study was to develop a data processing workflow by leveraging 3d deep learning models and a novel 3d data annotation tool to segment cotton plant parts and derive important architectural traits. results the point voxel convolutional neural network (pvcnn) combining both point- and voxel-based representations of 3d data shows less time consumption and better segmentation performance than point-based networks. results indicate that the best miou (89.12%) and accuracy (96.19%) with average inference time of 0.88 s were achieved through pvcnn, compared to pointnet and pointnet++. on the seven derived architectural traits from segmented parts, an r-2 value of more than 0.8 and mean absolute percentage error of less than 10% were attained. conclusion this plant part segmentation method based on 3d deep learning enables effective and efficient architectural trait measurement from point clouds, which could be useful to advance plant breeding programs and characterization of in-season developmental traits. the plant part segmentation code is available at https://github.com/uga-.bsail/plant_3d_deep_learning.",AB_0468
