"background: the need for scalable delivery of mental health care services that are efficient and effective is now a major public health priority. artificial intelligence (ai) tools have the potential to improve behavioral health care services by helping clinicians collect objective data on patients' progress, streamline their workflow, and automate administrative tasks. objective: the aim of this study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an ai platform for behavioral health in facilitating better clinical outcomes for patients receiving outpatient therapy. methods: the study was conducted at a community-based clinic in the united states. participants were 47 adults referred for outpatient, individual cognitive behavioral therapy for a main diagnosis of a depressive or anxiety disorder. the platform provided by eleos health was compared to treatment-as-usual (tau) approach during the first 2 months of therapy. this ai platform summarizes and transcribes the therapy session, provides feedback to therapists on the use of evidence-based practices, and integrates these data with routine standardized questionnaires completed by patients. the information is also used to draft the session's progress note. patients were randomized to receive either therapy provided with the support of an ai platform developed by eleos health or tau at the same clinic. data analysis was carried out based on intention-to-treat approach from december 2022 to january 2023. the primary outcomes included the feasibility and acceptability of the ai platform. secondary outcomes included changes in depression (patient health questionnaire-9) and anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder-7) scores as well as treatment attendance, satisfaction, and perceived helpfulness. results: a total of 72 patients were approached, of whom 47 (67%) agreed to participate. participants were adults (34/47, 72% women and 13/47, 28% men; mean age 30.64, sd 11.02 years), 23 randomized to the ai platform group, and 24 to tau. participants in the ai group attended, on average, 67% (mean 5.24, sd 2.31) more sessions compared to those in tau (mean 3.14, sd 1.99). depression and anxiety symptoms were reduced by 34% and 29% in the ai platform group versus 20% and 8% for tau, respectively, with large effect sizes for the therapy delivered with the support of the ai platform. no group difference was found in 2-month treatment satisfaction and perceived helpfulness. further, therapists using the ai platform submitted their progress notes, on average, 55 hours earlier than therapists in the tau group (t=-0.73; p<.001). conclusions: in this randomized controlled trial, therapy provided with the support of eleos health demonstrated superior depression and anxiety outcomes as well as patient retention, compared with tau. these findings suggest that complementing the mental health services provided in community-based clinics with an ai platform specializing in behavioral treatment was more effective in reducing key symptoms than standard therapy. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct05745103; https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct05745103",AB_0578
"background: ketogenic diets (kds) are safe and tolerable in people with multiple sclerosis (ms). while many patient-reported and clinical benefits are noted, the sustainability of these diets outside of a clinical trial is unknown.aims: evaluate patient perceptions of the kd following intervention, determine the degree of adherence to kds post-trial, and examine what factors increase the likelihood of kd continuation following the structured diet intervention trial.methods: sixty-five subjects with relapsing ms previously enrolled into a 6-month prospective, intention-to-treat kd intervention. following the 6-month trial, subjects were asked to return for a 3 -month post-study follow-up, at which time patient reported outcomes, dietary recall, clinical outcome measures, and laboratory values were repeated. in addition, subjects completed a survey to evaluate sustained and attenuated benefits following completion of the intervention phase of the trial.results: fifty-two subjects (81%) returned for the 3-month post-kd intervention visit. twenty-one percent reported continued adherence to a strict kd and an additional 37% reported adhering to a liberalized, less restrictive form of the kd. those subjects with greater reductions in body mass index (bmi) and fatigue at 6-months on-diet were more likely to continue on kd following trial completion. using intention-to-treat analysis, patient-reported and clinical outcomes at 3-months post-trial remained significantly improved from baseline (pre-kd), though the degree of improvement was slightly attenuated relative to outcomes at 6-months on kd. regardless of diet type following the kd intervention, dietary patterns shifted toward greater protein and polyunsaturated fats and less carbo-hydrate/added sugar consumption.conclusions: following the 6-month kd intervention study, the majority of subjects elected to continue on kd, though many pursued a more liberal limit for carbohydrate restriction. those who experienced a greater reduction in bmi or fatigue were more likely to continue with strict kd. the 6-month kd intervention induced persistent changes to dietary habits in the months following study completion. trial registration information: registered on clinicaltrials.gov under registration number nct03718247, posted on oct 24, 2018. first patient enrollment date: nov 1, 2018. link: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/ show/nct03718247?term=nct03718247 & draw=2 & rank=1.& copy; 2023 elsevier ltd and european society for clinical nutrition and metabolism. all rights reserved.",AB_0578
"background: the iron regulatory hormones erythroferrone (erfe), erythropoietin (epo), and hepcidin, and the cargo receptor nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (ncoa4) are expressed in the placenta. however, determinants of placental expression of these proteins and their associations with maternal or neonatal iron status are unknown.objectives: to characterize expression of placental erfe, epo, and ncoa4 mrna in placentae from newborns at increased risk of iron deficiency and to evaluate these in relation to maternal and neonatal iron status and regulatory hormones. methods: placentae were collected from 114 neonates born to adolescents carrying singletons (14-18 y) and 110 neonates born to 54 adults (20-46 y) carrying multiples. placental epo, erfe, and ncoa4 mrna expression were measured by rt-qpcr and compared with maternal and neonatal iron status indicators (sf, stfr, total body iron, serum iron) and hormones.results: placental erfe, epo, and ncoa4 mrna were detected in all placentae delivered between 25 and 42 wk of gestation. relationships between placental erfe and epo differed by cohort. in the multiples cohort, placental epo and erfe were positively correlated (p=0.004), but only a positive trend (p=0.08) was evident in the adolescents. placental epo and erfe were not associated with maternal or neonatal iron status markers or hormones in either cohort. placental ncoa4 was not associated with placental epo or erfe in either cohort but was negatively associated with maternal sf (p=0.03) in the multiples cohort and positively associated with neonatal stfr (p=0.009) in the adolescents.conclusions: the human placenta expresses erfe, epo, and ncoa4 mrna as early as 25 wk of gestation. placental expression of erfe and epo transcripts was not associated with maternal or neonatal iron status. greater placental ncoa4 transcript expression was evident in women and newborns with poor iron status (lower sf and higher stfr, respectively). further research is needed to characterize the roles of these proteins in the human placenta.trial registration number: these clinical trials were registered at clinicaltrials.gov as nct01019902 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ nct01019902) and nct01582802 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct01582802).",AB_0578
"toxic conversations during software development interactions may have serious repercussions on a free and open source software (foss) development project. for example, victims of toxic conversations may become afraid to express themselves, therefore get demotivated, and may eventually leave the project. automated filtering of toxic conversations may help a foss community maintain healthy interactions among its members. however, off-the-shelf toxicity detectors perform poorly on a software engineering dataset, such as one curated from code review comments. to counter this challenge, we present toxicr, a supervised learning based toxicity identification tool for code review interactions. toxicr includes a choice to select one of the 10 supervised learning algorithms, an option to select text vectorization techniques, eight preprocessing steps, and a large-scale labeled dataset of 19,651 code review comments. two out of those eight preprocessing steps are software engineering domain specific. with our rigorous evaluation of the models with various combinations of preprocessing steps and vectorization techniques, we have identified the best combination for our dataset that boosts 95.8% accuracy and an 88.9% f1-score in identifying toxic texts. toxicr significantly outperforms existing toxicity detectors on our dataset. we have released our dataset, pre-trainedmodels, evaluation results, and source code publicly, which is available at https://github.com/wsu- seal/toxicr.",AB_0578
"background: seasonal temperature variability remains understudied and may be modified by climate change. most temperature-mortality studies examine short-term exposures using time-series data. these studies are limited by regional adaptation, short-term mortality displacement, and an inability to observe longer-term relationships in temperature and mortality. seasonal temperature and cohort analyses allow the long-term effects of regional climatic change on mortality to be analyzed.objectives: we aimed to carry out one of the first investigations of seasonal temperature variability and mortality across the contiguous united states. we also investigated factors that modify this association. using adapted quasi-experimental methods, we hoped to account for unobserved confounding and to investigate regional adaptation and acclimatization at the zip code level.methods: we examined the mean and standard deviation (sd) of daily temperature in the warm (april-september) and cold (october-march) season in the medicare cohort from 2000 to 2016. this cohort comprised 622,427,230 y of person-time in all adults over the age of 65 y from 2000 to 2016. we used daily mean temperature obtained from gridmet to develop yearly seasonal temperature variables for each zip code. we used an adapted difference-in-difference approach model with a three-tiered clustering approach and meta-analysis to observe the relationship between temperature variability and mortality within zip codes. effect modification was assessed with stratified analyses by race and population density.results: for every 1 & deg;c increase in the sd of warm and cold season temperature, the mortality rate increased by 1.54% [95% confidence interval (ci): 0.73%, 2.15%] and 0.69% (95% ci: 0.22%, 1.15%) respectively. we did not see significant effects for seasonal mean temperatures. participants who were classified by medicare into an other race group had smaller effects than those classified as white for cold and cold sd and areas with lower population density had larger effects for warm sd.discussion: warm and cold season temperature variability were significantly associated with increased mortality rates in u.s. individuals over the age of 65 y, even after controlling for seasonal temperature averages. warm and cold season mean temperatures showed null effects on mortality. cold sd had a larger effect size for those who were in the racial subgroup other, whereas warm sd was more harmful for those living in lower population density areas. this study adds to the growing calls for urgent climate mitigation and environmental health adaptation and resiliency. https://doi. org/10.1289/ehp11588",AB_0578
"research highlight: hoenle, p. o., staab, m., donoso, d. a., argoti, a., & bluthgen, n. (2023). stratification and recovery time jointly shape ant functional reassembly in a neotropical forest. journal of animal ecology, https://doi.org/10.1111/13652656.13896. space, time and abiotic variation are primary axes across investigations of community ecology and disturbed ecosystems offer tractable systems for assessing their relative impact. while recovering forests can act as isolated case studies in understanding community assembly, it is not well understood how individual micro habitats respond to recovery and ultimately shape community attributes. hoenle et al. (2023) leverage the ubiquity and microhabitat-specific diversity of ants across a gradient from active agricultural sites to old-growth forest and assess how recovery and stratification together shape communities. the authors find distinct stratification across phylogenetic, functional and trait diversity as forest recovery time increases, while also recovering unique recovery trajectories contingent on trait sampling. while stratified, phylogenetic and functional diversity did not increase along this recovery gradient. ten out of 13 sampled traits were jointly influenced by both stratification and recovery time. in contrast to intuitive predictions, a majority of trait means converged throughout the recovery period. results highlight the multifaceted nature of recovery based community assembly and the capacity of multidimensional sampling to uncover surprising patterns in ecologically diverse lineages.",AB_0578

"objective the two main objectives of this study were to explore the rate of spinal dysraphism within bladder and cloacal exstrophy and to analyze the relationship between spinal dysraphism surgery, including timing of spinal dysra-phism surgery, with urological and neurological outcomes.methods a prospectively maintained irb-approved database of pediatric exstrophy patients treated from 1982 to 2021 was retrospectively reviewed for patients with spinal dysraphism. spinal dysraphism was categorized into the fol-lowing 7 subtypes: lipoma-based closed defect, myelomeningocele, meningocele, diastematomyelia, myelocystocele, low-lying conus with tethered cord/fatty filum, and sacral bony defect. other factors assessed included patient demo- graphic characteristics, type of spinal dysraphism procedure, reoperation, complication, presence of other neurological problems (e.g., hydrocephalus, chiari malformation), neurological status, and urological function. results analysis revealed that 114/1401 patients had coexisting spinal dysraphism. of these 114, sufficient records including type of dysraphism were available for 54. spinal dysraphism was most common within cloacal exstrophy (83.3% [45/54 patients]), followed by cloacal exstrophy variants (9.3% [5/54]), classic bladder exstrophy (3.7% [2/54]), and classic bladder exstrophy variants (3.7% [2/54]). within spinal dysraphism, lipoma-based closed defects (63.0% [34/54]) and low-lying conus with tethered cord/fatty filum (11.1% [6/54]) were most common. hydrocephalus and chiari malformation occurred in 24.1% (13/54) and 11.1% (6/54) of patients. all 13 patients with hydrocephalus underwent shunt placement. among those who underwent neurosurgical intervention, the complication rate for spinal dysraphism was 14.6% (7/48). motor function data were available for 41 patients and revealed that motor function declined for 2/41 (4.8%) patients and improved for 6/41 (14.6%) after neurosurgery. there was no statistical difference in lower-extremity motor outcome related to timing of neurosurgery and exstrophy closure.conclusions the authors have reported the surgical management and outcomes of patients with exstrophy and coexisting spinal dysraphism (n = 54). in 54 patients, spinal dysraphism was most common in the subset of patients with cloacal exstrophy (83.3%). lipoma-based closed defects (63.0%) and low-lying conus with tethered cord/fatty filum (11.1%) were the most common, and the rates of hydrocephalus and chiari malformation were 24.1% and 11.1%, respec-tively. there was no difference in lower-extremity motor outcome related to timing of neurosurgery and exstrophy closure. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2023.3.peds22447",AB_0578
"objective patients requiring intrathecal baclofen (itb) therapy are at high risk for surgical site infections (ssis) given their poor functional status. after years of a nominal infection rate, there was an inexplicable increase in itb pump infections at the authors' institution and multiple investigations offered no solution. use of intraoperative topical antibiotics is well-documented in the orthopedic literature and was considered for itb pump insertion. in this study, the authors investigated whether intraoperative vancomycin and tobramycin powder at the itb pump site could reduce ssis. methods operative and infection data were collected and analyzed retrospectively to determine the efficacy of this change. patients were stratified into three cohorts (1998-2009, 2010-2012, and 2013-2021) to better understand the trends before and after implementation of intraoperative topical antibiotics. each cohort had similar demographics. results one hundred fifty-four patients underwent 272 itb pump procedures between 1998 and 2021 (131 in 1998-2009, 49 in 2010-2012, and 92 in 2013-2021) for cerebral palsy (69.5%), spastic quadriparesis due to traumatic brain injury (7.1%), anoxic brain injury (6.5%), and other causes (16.9%). infection rates were reduced from a high of 32% in 2010-2011 to 3.8% over the last 2.5 years (p = 0.0094). there were no adverse effects from the use of topical antibiotics. conclusions in the setting of an intractable rise in itb pump infections, the addition of intraoperative topical antibiotics significantly reduced postoperative infections in a high-risk population. one could appreciate a significant drop each year in the rate of infections after the institution of intraoperative topical antibiotics. the reduction in ssis significantly improved the long-term outcomes for these patients. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2023.3.peds22508",AB_0578
