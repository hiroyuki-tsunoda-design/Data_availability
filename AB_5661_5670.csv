"background: sexual violence against women is prevalent worldwide. prevention programs that treat men as allies and integrate a bystander framework are emerging in lower income settings, but evidence of their effectiveness is conflicting.objective: this study aimed to test the impact of globalconsent on sexually violent behavior and prosocial bystander behavior among university men in vietnam.methods: we used a double-blind, parallel intervention versus control group design with 1:1 randomization at 2 universities. a total of 793 consenting heterosexual or bisexual men aged 18-24 years who matriculated in september 2019 were enrolled and assigned randomly to globalconsent or an attention-control adolescent health education (ahead) program. globalconsent is an adapted, theory-based, 6-module web-based intervention with diverse behavior change techniques and a locally produced serial drama. ahead is a customized, 6-module attention-control program on adolescent health. both the programs were delivered to computers and smartphones over 12 weeks. self-reported sexually violent behaviors toward women in the prior 6 months and prosocial bystander behaviors in the prior year were measured at 0, 6, and 12 months.results: more than 92.7% (735/793) of men in both study arms completed at least 1 program module, and >90.2% (715/793) of men completed all 6 modules. at baseline, a notable percentage of men reported any sexually violent behavior (globalconsent: 123/396, 31.1%; ahead: 103/397, 25.9%) in the prior 6 months. among men receiving globalconsent, the odds of reporting a high level (at least 2 acts) of sexually violent behavior at the endline were 1.3 times the odds at baseline. among men receiving ahead, the corresponding odds ratio was higher at 2.7. the odds of reporting any bystander behavior at endline were 0.7 times the odds at baseline for globalconsent, and the corresponding odds ratio for ahead was lower at 0.5.conclusions: compared with a health attention-control condition, globalconsent has sustained favorable impacts on sexually violent behavior and prosocial bystander behavior among matriculating university men in vietnam, who would otherwise face increasing risks of sexually violent behavior. globalconsent shows promise for national scale-up and regional adaptations.trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct04147455; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04147455",AB_0567
"background: data on beta-lactam hypersensitivity (blh) are mainly focused on immediate or mild nonimmediate reactions in the ambulatory setting, but limited in patients with concurrent illness and moderate-to-severe nonimmediate reactions in the hospitalized setting. objective: to investigate the entire spectrum of blh in thai tertiary hospital. methods: clinical characteristics of 357 patients with suspected blh were evaluated in a 7-year period. culprit drug identification was performed in 335 patients by combined skin testing, in vitro testing, or drug provocation tests. results: the predominant blh presentations were non-immunoglobulin (ig)e-mediated reactions with severe cutaneous adverse reactions of 18.9%, and blh status was definitively confirmed in 18.1%. the most common verified culprits were cephalosporins (34.8%), particularly in hypersensitivity type iv reactions. natural penicillins were the main implicated drugs in 48.5% of ambulatory patients. in contrast, cephalosporins and carbapenems were the main implicated drugs in hospitalized patients. non-ige-mediated anaphylaxis and serum sicknesslike reaction remained diagnostically challenged. new generations of beta-lactams, hospitalized patients, recent allergic history, and underlying malignancies or autoimmune diseases were associated with increased blh risk. conclusion: at present, cephalosporins are the leading causes of blh, particularly in non-ige-mediated reactions. more research on the verification of non-ige hypersensitivity reactions from new generations of beta-lactams should be better emphasized. clinical trial registration: the registry was approved by the ethics and research committee of the faculty of medicine, chulalongkorn university, and listed on clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: nct01667055; https://www.clini & copy; 2022 american college of allergy, asthma & immunology. published by elsevier inc.",AB_0567
"background: hetnets, short for heterogeneous networks, contain multiple node and relationship types and offer a way to encode biomedical knowledge. one such example, hetionet, connects 11 types of nodes-including genes, diseases, drugs, pathways, and anatomical structures-with over 2 million edges of 24 types. previous work has demonstrated that supervised machine learning methods applied to such networks can identify drug repurposing opportunities. however, a training set of known relationships does not exist for many types of node pairs, even when it would be useful to examine how nodes of those types are meaningfully connected. for example, users may be curious about not only how metformin is related to breast cancer but also how a given gene might be involved in insomnia. findings: we developed a new procedure, termed hetnet connectivity search, that proposes important paths between any 2 nodes without requiring a supervised gold standard. the algorithm behind connectivity search identifies types of paths that occur more frequently than would be expected by chance (based on node degree alone). several optimizations were required to precompute significant instances of node connectivity at the scale of large knowledge graphs. conclusion: we implemented the method on hetionet and provide an online interface at https://het.io/search. we provide an open-source implementation of these methods in our new python package named hetmatpy.",AB_0567
"the role of fibrillar collagen in the tissue microenvironment is critical in disease contexts ranging from cancers to chronic inflammations, as evidenced by many studies. quantifying fibrillar collagen organization has become a powerful approach for characterizing the topology of collagen fibers and studying the role of collagen fibers in disease progression. we present a deep learning-based pipeline to quantify collagen fibers' topological properties in microscopy-based collagen images from pathological tissue samples. our method leverages deep neural networks to extract collagen fiber centerlines and deep generative models to create synthetic training data, addressing the current shortage of large-scale annotations. as a part of this effort, we have created and annotated a collagen fiber centerline dataset, with the hope of facilitating further research in this field. quantitative measurements such as fiber orientation, alignment, density, and length can be derived based on the centerline extraction results. our pipeline comprises three stages. initially, a variational autoencoder is trained to generate synthetic centerlines possessing controllable topological properties. subsequently, a conditional generative adversarial network synthesizes realistic collagen fiber images from the synthetic centerlines, yielding a synthetic training set of image-centerline pairs. finally, we train a collagen fiber centerline extraction network using both the original and synthetic data. evaluation using collagen fiber images from pancreas, liver, and breast cancer samples collected via second-harmonic generation microscopy demonstrates our pipeline's superiority over several popular fiber centerline extraction tools. incorporating synthetic data into training further enhances the network's generalizability. our code is available at https://github.com/uw-loci/collagen-fiber-metrics.",AB_0567
"the rising prevalence of allergy demands efficient and accurate bioinformatic tools to expedite allergen identification and risk assessment while also reducing wet experiment expenses and time. recently, pretrained protein language models (plms) have successfully predicted protein structure and function. however, to our best knowledge, they have not been used for predicting allergenic proteins/peptides. therefore, this study aims to develop robust models for allergenic protein/peptide prediction using five plms of varying sizes and systematically assess their performance through fine-tuning with a convolutional neural network. the developed plm4alg models have achieved state-of-the-art performance with accuracy, matthews correlation coefficient, and area under the curve scoring 93.4-95.1%, 0.869-0.902, and 0.981-0.990, respectively. moreover, plm4alg is the first model capable of handling prediction tasks involving residue-missed sequences and sequences containing nonstandard amino acid residues. to facilitate easy access, a user-friendly web server (https://f6wxpfd3sh.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com) has been established. plm4alg is expected to become the leading machine learning-based prediction model for allergenic peptides and proteins. its collaboration with other predictors holds great promise for accelerating allergy research.",AB_0567
"two buoys equipped with doppler lidars owned by the us department of energy (doe) were deployed off the coast of california in autumn of 2020 by pacific northwest national laboratory. the buoys collected data for an entire annual cycle at two offshore locations proposed for offshore wind development by the bureau of ocean energy management. one of the buoys was deployed approximately 50 km off the coast near morro bay in central california in 1100 m of water. the second buoy was deployed approximately 40 km off humboldt county in northern california in 625 m of water. the buoys provided the first-ever continuous measurements of the air-sea transition zone off the coast of california. the atmospheric and oceanographic characteristics of the area and estimates of annual energy production at both the morro bay and humboldt wind energy areas show that both locations have a high wind energy yield and are prime locations for future floating offshore wind turbines. this article provides a description and comprehensive analysis of the data collected by the buoys, and a final post-processed dataset is uploaded to a data archive maintained by the doe. additional analysis was conducted to show the value of the data collected by the doe buoys. all post-processed data from this study are available on the wind data hub website: https://a2e.energy.gov/data# (last access: 14 september 2023). near-surface, wave, current, and cloud datasets for humboldt and morro bay are provided at 10.21947/1783807 (krishnamurthy and sheridan, 2023b) and 10.21947/1959715 (krishnamurthy and sheridan, 2023a), respectively. lidar datasets for humboldt and morro bay are provided at 10.21947/1783809 (krishnamurthy and sheridan, 2023d) and 10.21947/1959721 (krishnamurthy and sheridan, 2023c), respectively.",AB_0567
"chia (salvia hispanica l.) is one of the most popular nutrition-rich foods and pseudocereal crops of the family lamiaceae. chia seeds are a rich source of proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas), dietary fibers, and antioxidants. in this study, we present the assembly of the chia reference genome, which spans 303.6 mb and encodes 48,090 annotated protein-coding genes. our analysis revealed that similar to 42% of the chia genome harbors repetitive content, and identified similar to 3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) and 15,380 simple sequence repeat (ssr) marker sites. by investigating the chia transcriptome, we discovered that similar to 44% of the genes undergo alternative splicing with a higher frequency of intron retention events. additionally, we identified chia genes associated with important nutrient content and quality traits, such as the biosynthesis of pufas and seed mucilage fiber (dietary fiber) polysaccharides. notably, this is the first report of in-silico annotation of a plant genome for protein-derived small bioactive peptides (biopeptides) associated with improving human health. to facilitate further research and translational applications of this valuable orphan crop, we have developed the salvia genomics database (salviagdb), accessible at https://salviagdb.org.",AB_0567
"a diverse echinoderm fauna lived in reef and non-reef silurian facies of the upper midwestern usa. however, these faunas are dominantly preserved in dolostones with moldic preservation, and fossils from dolostone facies have not been documented to the extent of silurian crinoids in nondolostone strata. herein, an echinoderm fauna is described from the dolostones of the cedarville member of the laurel limestone (wenlock, homerian) from the pepcon cement quarry in west-central ohio. the described fauna contains blastoids, hemicosmitoids, and crinoids, including troosticrinus subcylindricus (hall and whitfield, 1875); caryocrinites sp. indet.; an unidentifiable diplobathrid camerate; periechocrinus tennesseensis (hall and whitfield, 1875); periechocrinus egani?

"task planning systems have been developed to help robots use human knowledge (about actions) to complete long-horizon tasks. most of them have been developed for closed worlds while assuming the robot is provided with complete world knowledge. however, the real world is generally open, and the robots frequently encounter unforeseen situations that can potentially break theplanner's completeness. could we leverage the recent advances on pre-trained large language models (llms) to enable classical planning systems to deal with novel situations? this paper introduces a novel framework, called cowp, for open-world task planning and situation handling. cowp dynamically augments the robot's action knowledge, including the preconditions and effects of actions, with task-oriented commonsense knowledge. cowp embraces the openness from llms, and is grounded to specific domains via action knowledge. for systematic evaluations, we collected a dataset that includes 1085 execution-time situations. each situation corresponds to a state instance wherein a robot is potentially unable to complete a task using a solution that normally works. experimental results show that our approach outperforms competitive baselines from the literature in the success rate of service tasks. additionally, we have demonstrated cowp using a mobile manipulator. supplementary materials are available at: https://cowplanning.github.io/",AB_0567
"guidelines for color use in quantitative visualizations have strongly discouraged the use of rainbow colormaps, arguing instead for smooth designs that do not induce visual discontinuities or implicit color categories. however, the empirical evidence behind this argument has been mixed and, at times, even contradictory. in practice, rainbow colormaps are widely used, raising questions about the true utility or dangers of such designs. we study how color categorization impacts the interpretation of scalar fields. we first introduce an approach to detect latent categories in colormaps. we hypothesize that the appearance of color categories in scalar visualizations can be beneficial in that they enhance the perception of certain features, although at the cost of rendering other features less noticeable. in three crowdsourced experiments, we show that observers are more likely to discriminate global, distributional features when viewing colorful scales that induce categorization (e.g., rainbow or diverging schemes). conversely, when seeing the same data through a less colorful representation, observers are more likely to report localized features defined by small variations in the data. participants showed awareness of these different affordances, and exhibited bias for exploiting the more discriminating colormap, given a particular feature type. our results demonstrate costs and benefits for rainbows (and similarly colorful schemes), suggesting that their complementary utility for analyzing scalar data should not be dismissed. in addition to explaining potentially valid uses of rainbow, our study provides actionable guidelines, including on when such designs can be more harmful than useful. data and materials are available at https://osf.io/xjhtf",AB_0567
