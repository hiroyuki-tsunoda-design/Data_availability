"neural morphology, the branching geometry of brain cells, is an essential cellular substrate of nervous system function and pathology. despite the accelerating production of digital reconstructions of neural morphology, the public accessibility of data remains a core issue in neuroscience. deficiencies in the availability of existing data create redundancy of research efforts and limit synergy. we carried out a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of neural morphology publications to quantify the impact of data sharing in the neuroscience community. our findings demonstrate that sharing digital reconstructions of neural morphology via neuromorpho.org leads to a significant increase of citations to the original article, thus directly benefiting authors. the rate of data reusage remains constant for at least 16 years after sharing (the whole period analyzed), altogether nearly doubling the peer-reviewed discoveries in the field. furthermore, the recent availability of larger and more numerous datasets fostered integrative applications, which accrue on average twice the citations of re-analyses of individual datasets. we also released an open-source citation tracking web-service allowing researchers to monitor reusage of their datasets in independent peer-reviewed reports. these results and tools can facilitate the recognition of shared data reuse for merit evaluations and funding decisions. availability and implementation: the application is available at: http://cng-nmo-dev3.orc.gmu.edu:8181/. the source code at https://github.com/herveemissah/nmo-authors-app and https://github.com/herveemissah/nmo-bibliometric-analysis.",AB_0594
"motivation summary statistics from genome-wide association studies enable many valuable downstream analyses that are more efficient than individual-level data analysis while also reducing privacy concerns. as growing sample sizes enable better-powered analysis of gene-environment interactions, there is a need for gene-environment interaction-specific methods that manipulate and use summary statistics.results we introduce two tools to facilitate such analysis, with a focus on statistical models containing multiple gene-exposure and/or gene-covariate interaction terms. regem (re-analysis of gem summary statistics) uses summary statistics from a single, multi-exposure genome-wide interaction study to derive analogous sets of summary statistics with arbitrary sets of exposures and interaction covariate adjustments. metagem (meta-analysis of gem summary statistics) extends current fixed-effects meta-analysis models to incorporate multiple exposures from multiple studies. we demonstrate the value and efficiency of these tools by exploring alternative methods of accounting for ancestry-related population stratification in genome-wide interaction study in the uk biobank as well as by conducting a multi-exposure genome-wide interaction study meta-analysis in cohorts from the diabetes-focused prodigy consortium. these programs help to maximize the value of summary statistics from diverse and complex gene-environment interaction studies.availability and implementation regem and metagem are open-source projects freely available at https://github.com/large-scale-gxe-methods/regem and https://github.com/large-scale-gxe-methods/metagem.",AB_0594
"backgrounddetection of exotic plant pathogens and preventing their entry and establishment are critical for the protection of agricultural systems while securing the global trading of agricultural commodities. high-throughput sequencing (hts) has been applied successfully for plant pathogen discovery, leading to its current application in routine pathogen detection. however, the analysis of massive amounts of hts data has become one of the major challenges for the use of hts more broadly as a rapid diagnostics tool. several bioinformatics pipelines have been developed to handle hts data with a focus on plant virus and viroid detection. however, there is a need for an integrative tool that can simultaneously detect a wider range of other plant pathogens in hts data, such as bacteria (including phytoplasmas), fungi, and oomycetes, and this tool should also be capable of generating a comprehensive report on the phytosanitary status of the diagnosed specimen.resultswe have developed an open-source bioinformatics pipeline called phytopipe (phytosanitary pipeline) to provide the plant pathology diagnostician community with a user-friendly tool that integrates analysis and visualization of hts rna-seq data. phytopipe includes quality control of reads, read classification, assembly-based annotation, and reference-based mapping. the final product of the analysis is a comprehensive report for easy interpretation of not only viruses and viroids but also bacteria (including phytoplasma), fungi, and oomycetes. phytopipe is implemented in snakemake workflow with python 3 and bash scripts in a linux environment. the source code for phytopipe is freely available and distributed under a bsd-3 license.conclusionsphytopipe provides an integrative bioinformatics pipeline that can be used for the analysis of hts rna-seq data. phytopipe is easily installed on a linux or mac system and can be conveniently used with a docker image, which includes all dependent packages and software related to analyses. it is publicly available on github at https://github.com/healthyplant/phytopipe and on docker hub at https://hub.docker.com/r/healthyplant/phytopipe.",AB_0594
"motivation protein sequences can be broadly categorized into two classes: those which adopt stable secondary structure and fold into a domain (i.e. globular proteins), and those that do not. the sequences belonging to this latter class are conformationally heterogeneous and are described as being intrinsically disordered. decades of investigation into the structure and function of globular proteins has resulted in a suite of computational tools that enable their sub-classification by domain type, an approach that has revolutionized how we understand and predict protein functionality. conversely, it is unknown if sequences of disordered protein regions are subject to broadly generalizable organizational principles that would enable their sub-classification.results here, we report the development of a statistical approach that quantifies linear variance in amino acid composition across a sequence. with multiple examples, we provide evidence that intrinsically disordered regions are organized into statistically non-random modules of unique compositional bias. modularity is observed for both low and high-complexity sequences and, in some cases, we find that modules are organized in repetitive patterns. these data demonstrate that disordered sequences are non-randomly organized into modular architectures and motivate future experiments to comprehensively classify module types and to determine the degree to which modules constitute functionally separable units analogous to the domains of globular proteins.availability and implementation the source code, documentation, and data to reproduce all figures are freely available at https://github.com/mwplabutsw/chi-score-analysis.git. the analysis is also available as a google colab notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/github/mwplabutsw/chi-score-analysis/blob/main/chiscore_analysis.ipynb).",AB_0594
"motivation: analysis of open chromatin regions across multiple samples from two or more distinct conditions can determine altered gene regulatory patterns associated with biological phenotypes and complex traits. the atac-seq assay allows for tractable genome-wide open chromatin profiling of large numbers of samples. stable, broadly applicable genomic annotations of open chromatin regions are not available. thus, most studies first identify open regions using peak calling methods for each sample independently. these are then heuristically combined to obtain a consensus peak set. reconciling sample-specific peak results post hoc from larger cohorts is particularly challenging, and informative spatial features specific to open chromatin signals are not leveraged effectively.results: we propose a novel method, rocco, that determines consensus open chromatin regions across multiple samples simultaneously. rocco employs robust summary statistics and solves a constrained optimization problem formulated to account for both enrichment and spatial dependence of open chromatin signal data. we show this formulation admits attractive theoretical and conceptual properties as well as superior empirical performance compared to current methodology.availability and implementation: source code, documentation, and usage demos for rocco are available on github at: https://github.com/nolan-h-hamilton/rocco. rocco can also be installed as a stand-alone binary utility using pip/pypi.",AB_0594
"motivation differentiating ecosystems poses a complex, high-dimensional problem constrained by capturing relevant variation across species profiles. researchers use pairwise distances and subsequent dimensionality reduction to highlight variation in a few dimensions. despite popularity in analysis of ecological data, these low-dimensional visualizations can contain geometric abnormalities such as arch and horseshoe effects, potentially obscuring the impact of environmental gradients. these abnormalities appear in ordination but are in fact a product of oversaturated large pairwise distances.results we present local manifold distance (lmdist), an unsupervised algorithm which adjusts pairwise beta diversity measures to better represent true ecological distances between samples. beta diversity measures can have a bounded dynamic range in depicting long environmental gradients with high species turnover. using a graph structure, lmdist projects pairwise distances onto a manifold and traverses the manifold surface to adjust pairwise distances at the upper end of the beta diversity measure's dynamic range. this allows for values beyond the range of the original measure. not all datasets will have oversaturated pairwise distances, nor will capture variation that resembles a manifold, so lmdist adjusts only those pairwise values which may be undervalued in the presence of a sampled gradient. the adjusted distances serve as input for ordination and statistical testing. we demonstrate on real and simulated data that lmdist effectively recovers distances along known gradients and along complex manifolds such as the swiss roll dataset. lmdist enables more powerful statistical tests for gradient effects and reveals variation orthogonal to the gradient.availability and implementation available on github at https://github.com/knights-lab/lmdist.",AB_0594
"motivation cell-type annotation is a time-consuming yet critical first step in the analysis of single-cell rna-seq data, especially when multiple similar cell subtypes with overlapping marker genes are present. existing automated annotation methods have a number of limitations, including requiring large reference datasets, high computation time, shallow annotation resolution, and difficulty in identifying cancer cells or their most likely cell of origin.results we developed census, a biologically intuitive and fully automated cell-type identification method for single-cell rna-seq data that can deeply annotate normal cells in mammalian tissues and identify malignant cells and their likely cell of origin. motivated by the inherently stratified developmental programs of cellular differentiation, census infers hierarchical cell-type relationships and uses gradient-boosted \decision trees that capitalize on nodal cell-type relationships to achieve high prediction speed and accuracy. when benchmarked on 44 atlas-scale normal and cancer, human and mouse tissues, census significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics and naturally predicts the cell-of-origin of different cancers. census is pretrained on the tabula sapiens to classify 175 cell-types from 24 organs; however, users can seamlessly train their own models for customized applications.availability and implementation census is available at zenodo https://zenodo.org/records/7017103 and on our github https://github.com/sjdlabgroup/census.",AB_0594
"spatial transcriptomics (st) technologies enable high throughput gene expression characterization within thin tissue sections. however, comparing spatial observations across sections, samples, and technologies remains challenging. to address this challenge, we develop stalign to align st datasets in a manner that accounts for partially matched tissue sections and other local non-linear distortions using diffeomorphic metric mapping. we apply stalign to align st datasets within and across technologies as well as to align st datasets to a 3d common coordinate framework. we show that stalign achieves high gene expression and cell-type correspondence across matched spatial locations that is significantly improved over landmark-based affine alignments. applying stalign to align st datasets of the mouse brain to the 3d common coordinate framework from the allen brain atlas, we highlight how stalign can be used to lift over brain region annotations and enable the interrogation of compositional heterogeneity across anatomical structures. stalign is available as an open-source python toolkit at https://github.com/jefworks-lab/stalign and as supplementary software with additional documentation and tutorials available at https://jef.works/stalign. spatial transcriptomics (st) enables gene expression characterisation within tissue sections, but comparing across sections and technologies remains challenging. here, authors develop stalign to spatially align st data and demonstrate applications including aligning to common coordinate frameworks.",AB_0594
"backgroundadding sequences into an existing (possibly user-provided) alignment has multiple applications, including updating a large alignment with new data, adding sequences into a constraint alignment constructed using biological knowledge, or computing alignments in the presence of sequence length heterogeneity. although this is a natural problem, only a few tools have been developed to use this information with high fidelity.resultswe present emma (extending multiple alignments using mafft--add) for the problem of adding a set of unaligned sequences into a multiple sequence alignment (i.e., a constraint alignment). emma builds on mafft--add, which is also designed to add sequences into a given constraint alignment. emma improves on mafft--add methods by using a divide-and-conquer framework to scale its most accurate version, mafft-linsi--add, to constraint alignments with many sequences. we show that emma has an accuracy advantage over other techniques for adding sequences into alignments under many realistic conditions and can scale to large datasets with high accuracy (hundreds of thousands of sequences). emma is available at https://github.com/c5shen/emma.conclusionsemma is a new tool that provides high accuracy and scalability for adding sequences into an existing alignment.",AB_0594
"the protein kinase ontology (prokino) is an integrated knowledge graph that conceptualizes the complex relationships among protein kinase sequence, structure, function, and disease in a human and machine-readable format. in this study, we have significantly expanded prokino by incorporating additional data on expression patterns and drug interactions. furthermore, we have developed a completely new browser from the ground up to render the knowledge graph visible and interactive on the web. we have enriched prokino with new classes and relationships that capture information on kinase ligand binding sites, expression patterns, and functional features. these additions extend prokino's capabilities as a discovery tool, enabling it to uncover novel insights about understudied members of the protein kinase family. we next demonstrate the application of prokino. specifically, through graph mining and aggregate sparql queries, we identify the p21-activated protein kinase 5 (pak5) as one of the most frequently mutated dark kinases in human cancers with abnormal expression in multiple cancers, including a previously unappreciated role in acute myeloid leukemia. we have identified recurrent oncogenic mutations in the pak5 activation loop predicted to alter substrate binding and phosphorylation. additionally, we have identified common ligand/drug binding residues in pak family kinases, underscoring prokino's potential application in drug discovery. the updated ontology browser and the addition of a web component, protvista, which enables interactive mining of kinase sequence annotations in 3d structures and alphafold models, provide a valuable resource for the signaling community. the updated prokino database is accessible at https://prokino.uga.edu.",AB_0594
