"imagery collected from outdoor visual environments is often degraded due to the presence of dense smoke or haze. a key challenge for research in scene understanding in these degraded visual environments (dve) is the lack of representative benchmark datasets. these datasets are required to evaluate state-of-the-art object recognition and other computer vision algorithms in degraded settings. in this paper, we address some of these limitations by introducing the first realistic haze image benchmark, from both aerial and ground view, with paired haze-free images, and in-situ haze density measurements. this dataset was produced in a controlled environment with professional smoke generating machines that covered the entire scene, and consists of images captured from the perspective of both an unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) and an unmanned ground vehicle (ugv). we also evaluate a set of representative state-of-the-art dehazing approaches as well as object detectors on the dataset. the full dataset presented in this paper, including the ground truth object classification bounding boxes and haze density measurements, is provided for the community to evaluate their algorithms at: https://a2i2-archangel.vision. a subset of this dataset has been used for the object detection in haze track of cvpr ug2 2022 challenge at https://cvpr2022.ug2challenge.org/track1.html.",AB_0621
"domain generalization (dg) aims to learn transferable knowledge from multiple source domains and generalize it to the unseen target domain. to achieve such expectation, the intuitive solution is to seek domain-invariant representations via generative adversarial mechanism or minimization of cross-domain discrepancy. however, the widespread imbalanced data scale problem across source domains and category in real-world applications becomes the key bottleneck of improving generalization ability of model due to its negative effect on learning the robust classification model. motivated by this observation, we first formulate a practical and challenging imbalance domain generalization (idg) scenario, and then propose a straightforward but effective novel method generative inference network (ginet), which augments reliable samples for minority domain/category to promote discriminative ability of the learned model. concretely, ginet utilizes the available cross-domain images from the identical category and estimates their common latent variable, which derives to discover domain-invariant knowledge for unseen target domain. according to these latent variables, our ginet further generates more novel samples with optimal transport constraint and deploys them to enhance the desired model with more robustness and generalization ability. considerable empirical analysis and ablation studies on three popular benchmarks under normal dg and idg setups suggests the advantage of our method over other dg methods on elevating model generalization. the source code is available in github https://github.com/haifengxia/idg.",AB_0621
"study objectives: to explore the relationship between polysomnography-derived respiratory indices and chronic pain status among individuals following traumatic brain injury (tbi).methods: participants (n = 66) with moderate to severe tbi underwent polysomnography during inpatient acute rehabilitation and their chronic pain status was assessed at 1-to 2-year follow-up as part of the tbi model systems pain collaborative study. pairwise comparisons across pain cohorts (ie, chronic pain, no history of pain) were made to explore differences on polysomnography indices.results: among our total sample, approximately three-quarters (74.2%) received sleep apnea diagnoses utilizing american academy of sleep medicine criteria, with 61.9% of those endorsing a history of chronic pain. of those endorsing chronic pain, the average pain score was 4.8 (standard deviation = 2.1), with a mean interference score of 5.3 (2.7). pairwise comparisons revealed that those endorsing a chronic pain experience at follow-up experienced categorically worse indicators of sleep-related breathing disorders during acute rehabilitation relative to those who did not endorse chronic pain. important differences were observed with elevations on central (chronic pain: 2.6; no pain: 0.8 per hour) and obstructive apnea (chronic pain: 15.7; no pain: 11.1 per hour) events, as well as oxygen desaturation indices (chronic pain: 19.6; no pain: 7.9 per hour).conclusions: sleep-disordered breathing appears worse among those who endorse chronic pain following moderate-to-severe tbi, but additional research is needed to understand its relation to postinjury pain. prospective investigation is necessary to determine how clinical decisions (eg, opioid therapy) and intervention (eg, positive airway pressure) may mutually influence outcomes.clinical trial registration: registry: clinicaltrials.gov; name: comparison of sleep apnea assessment strategies to maximize tbi rehabilitation participation and outcome (c-sas); url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03033901; identifier: nct03033901.",AB_0621
"objectives. to propose a novel bayesian spatial-temporal approach to identify and quantify severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) testing disparities for small area estimation.methods. in step 1, we used a bayesian inseparable space-time model framework to estimate the testing positivity rate (tpr) at geographically granular areas of the census block groups (cbgs). in step 2, we adopted a rank-based approach to compare the estimated tpr and the testing rate to identify areas with testing deficiency and quantify the number of needed tests. we used weekly sars-cov-2 infection and testing surveillance data from cameron county, texas, between march 2020 and february 2022 to demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed approach.results. we identified the cbgs that had experienced substantial testing deficiency, quantified the number of tests that should have been conducted in these areas, and evaluated the short-and long-term testing disparities.conclusions. our proposed analytical framework offers policymakers and public health practitioners a tool for understanding sars-cov-2 testing disparities in geographically small communities. it could also aid covid-19 response planning and inform intervention programs to improve goal setting and strategy implementation in sars-cov-2 testing uptake.

"video anomaly detection (vad) has been extensively studied for static cameras but is much more challenging in egocentric driving videos where the scenes are extremely dynamic. this paper proposes an unsupervised method for traffic vad based on future object localization. the idea is to predict future locations of traffic participants over a short horizon, and then monitor the accuracy and consistency of these predictions as evidence of an anomaly. inconsistent predictions tend to indicate an anomaly has occurred or is about to occur. to evaluate our method, we introduce a new large-scale benchmark dataset called detection of traffic anomaly (dota)containing 4,677 videos with temporal, spatial, and categorical annotations. we also propose a new vad evaluation metric, called spatial-temporal area under curve (stauc), and show that it captures how well a model detects both temporal and spatial locations of anomalies unlike existing metrics that focus only on temporal localization. experimental results show our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on dota in terms of both metrics. we offer rich categorical annotations in dota to benchmark video action detection and online action detection methods. the dota dataset has been made available at: https://github.com/moonblvd/detection-of-traffic-anomaly",AB_0621
"most existing deep neural networks are static, which means they can only perform inference at a fixed complexity. but the resource budget can vary substantially across different devices. even on a single device, the affordable budget can change with different scenarios, and repeatedly training networks for each required budget would be incredibly expensive. therefore, in this work, we propose a general method called mutualnet to train a single network that can run at a diverse set of resource constraints. our method trains a cohort of model configurations with various network widths and input resolutions. this mutual learning scheme not only allows the model to run at different width-resolution configurations but also transfers the unique knowledge among these configurations, helping the model to learn stronger representations overall. mutualnet is a general training methodology that can be applied to various network structures (e.g., 2d networks: mobilenets, resnet, 3d networks: slowfast, x3d) and various tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, segmentation, and action recognition), and is demonstrated to achieve consistent improvements on a variety of datasets. since we only train the model once, it also greatly reduces the training cost compared to independently training several models. surprisingly, mutualnet can also be used to significantly boost the performance of a single network, if dynamic resource constraints are not a concern. in summary, mutualnet is a unified method for both static and adaptive, 2d and 3d networks. code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/taoyang1122/mutualnet.",AB_0621
"backgroundelectrocardiographic imaging (ecgi) generates electrophysiological (ep) biomarkers while cardiovascular magnetic resonance (cmr) imaging provides data about myocardial structure, function and tissue substrate. combining this information in one examination is desirable but requires an affordable, reusable, and high-throughput solution. we therefore developed the cmr-ecgi vest and carried out this technical development study to assess its feasibility and repeatability in vivo.methodscmr was prospectively performed at 3t on participants after collecting surface potentials using the locally designed and fabricated 256-lead ecgi vest. epicardial maps were reconstructed to generate local ep parameters such as activation time (at), repolarization time (rt) and activation recovery intervals (ari). 20 intra- and inter-observer and 8 scan re-scan repeatability tests.results77 participants were recruited: 27 young healthy volunteers (hv, 38.9 +/- 8.5 years, 35% male) and 50 older persons (77.0 +/- 0.1 years, 52% male). cmr-ecgi was achieved in all participants using the same reusable, washable vest without complications. intra- and inter-observer variability was low (correlation coefficients [rs] across unipolar electrograms = 0.99 and 0.98 respectively) and scan re-scan repeatability was high (rs between 0.81 and 0.93). compared to young hv, older persons had significantly longer rt (296.8 vs 289.3 ms, p = 0.002), ari (249.8 vs 235.1 ms, p = 0.002) and local gradients of at, rt and ari (0.40 vs 0.34 ms/mm, p = 0,01; 0.92 vs 0.77 ms/mm, p = 0.03; and 1.12 vs 0.92 ms/mm, p = 0.01 respectively).conclusionour high-throughput cmr-ecgi solution is feasible and shows good reproducibility in younger and older participants. this new technology is now scalable for high throughput research to provide novel insights into arrhythmogenesis and potentially pave the way for more personalised risk stratification.clinical trial registration: title: multimorbidity life-course approach to myocardial health-a cardiac sub-study of the mrc national survey of health and development (nshd) (myofit46). national clinical trials (nct) number: nct05455125. url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct05455125?term=myofit&draw=2&rank=1conclusionour high-throughput cmr-ecgi solution is feasible and shows good reproducibility in younger and older participants. this new technology is now scalable for high throughput research to provide novel insights into arrhythmogenesis and potentially pave the way for more personalised risk stratification.clinical trial registration: title: multimorbidity life-course approach to myocardial health-a cardiac sub-study of the mrc national survey of health and development (nshd) (myofit46). national clinical trials (nct) number: nct05455125. url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct05455125?term=myofit&draw=2&rank=1",AB_0621
"antibody leads must fulfill multiple desirable properties to be clinical candidates. primarily due to the low throughput in the experimental procedure, the need for such multiproperty optimization causes the bottleneck in preclinical antibody discovery and development, because addressing one issue usually causes another. we developed a reinforcement learning (rl) method, named ab -gen, for antibody library design using a generative pre -trained transformer (gpt) as the policy network of the rl agent. we showed that this model can learn the antibody space of heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (cdrh3) and generate sequences with similar property distributions. besides, when using human epidermal growth factor receptor -2 (her2) as the target, the agent model of ab -gen was able to generate novel cdrh3 sequences that fulfill multi -property constraints. totally, 509 generated sequences were able to pass all property filters, and three highly conserved residues were identified. the importance of these residues was further demonstrated by molecular dynamics simulations, consolidating that the agent model was capable of grasping important information in this complex optimization task. overall, the abgen method is able to design novel antibody sequences with an improved success rate than the traditional propose -then -filter approach. it has the potential to be used in practical antibody design, thus empowering the antibody discovery and development process. the source code of ab -gen is freely available at zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7657016) and biocode (https://ngdc. cncb.ac.cn/biocode/tools/bt007341).",AB_0621
"global activities involving the collection of marine biodiversity information have provided a large amount of biological observation records that cover various spatiotemporal areas. to predict biological responses or distribution changes in response to environmental changes by using these observation records, it is essential to analyze not only the current marine physicochemical environmental conditions but also the past conditions when the organisms were observed. we developed a new function to estimate the past marine environmental conditions for the observation records in our marine biodiversity database (biological information system for marine life: bismal) and examine whether the database can reliably estimate thermal habitats for both benthic and planktonic marine organisms. for the benthic squat lobster shinkaia crosnieri, the estimated and observed in situ temperatures were similar to each other. for the planktonic chaetognaths krohnitta pacifica and k. subtilis, the estimated temperatures showed clear seasonal changes specific to their distribution areas. these results indicated that bismal can reliably provide past habitat conditions regardless of planktonic or benthic lifestyles. bismal, which provides both biological observations and estimated past environmental conditions through web services, could lower the barrier to data access and use and make data-driven science available not only for data scientists but also for various marine scientists, such as taxonomists, ecologists and field scientists.database url: https://www.godac.jamstec.go.jp/bismal/e/",AB_0621
"we describe an assemblage of isolated hybodontiform shark teeth from the nonmarine upper triassic (carnian) momonoki formation in the town of ominecho in mine, yamaguchi, japan. these teeth were first reported in 1996 and tentatively referred to the genus hybodus, but their taxonomy was not rigorously evaluated in an apomorphy-based context, and they have since been mostly overlooked. herein, we assign them to a new species, parvodus ominechonensis, based on a combination of synapomorphies of the lonchidiid genus parvodus and autapomorphic character states. a diversity of triassic hybodontiforms is known from japan, but of these, parvodus ominechonensis sp. nov. is the only taxon known from nonmarine deposits and the first reported occurrence of lonchidiidae. parvodus ominechonensis fills a gap in the stratigraphic record of parvodus between occurrences in middle triassic (anisian) and middle jurassic (bajocian) strata. the global triassic record of parvodus comprises parvodus huizodus from the olenekian of china, parvodus sp. from the anisian of china, and parvodus ominechonensis from the carnian of japan, of which parvodus ominechonensis and parvodus huizodus are known from nonmarine deposits. after the triassic, parvodus is known from marine and nonmarine strata across laurasia and in south america until its extinction during the early cretaceous. this suggests that parvodus may have originated in freshwater habitats in the south china region of pangea following the end-permian mass extinction and diversified throughout the triassic in present day east asia before attaining a global distribution later in the mesozoic.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:42b4d1c1-f4be-4296-896b-01b048bde25f",AB_0621
