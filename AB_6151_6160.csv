"training deep graph neural networks (gnns) is notoriously hard. besides the standard plights in training deep architectures such as vanishing gradients and overfitting, it also uniquely suffers from over-smoothing, information squashing, and so on, which limits their potential power for encoding the high-order neighbor structure in large-scale graphs. although numerous efforts are proposed to address these limitations, such as various forms of skip connections, graph normalization, and random dropping, it is difficult to disentangle the advantages brought by a deep gnn architecture from those tricks necessary to train such an architecture. moreover, the lack of a standardized benchmark with fair and consistent experimental settings poses an almost insurmountable obstacle to gauge the effectiveness of new mechanisms. in view of those, we present the first fair and reproducible benchmark dedicated to assessing the tricks of training deep gnns. we categorize existing approaches, investigate their hyperparameter sensitivity, and unify the basic configuration. comprehensive evaluations are then conducted on tens of representative graph datasets including the recent large-scale open graph benchmark, with diverse deep gnn backbones. we demonstrate that an organic combo of initial connection, identity mapping, group and batch normalization attains the new state-of-the-art results for deep gnns on large datasets. codes are available: https://github.com/vita-group/deep_gcn_benchmarking.",AB_0616
"in-situ visual observations of marine organisms is crucial to developing behavioural understandings and their relations to their surrounding ecosystem. typically, these observations are collected via divers, tags, and remotely-operated or human-piloted vehicles. recently, however, autonomous underwater vehicles equipped with cameras and embedded computers with gpu capabilities are being developed for a variety of applications, and in particular, can be used to supplement these existing data collection mechanisms where human operation or tags are more difficult. existing approaches have focused on using fully-supervised tracking methods, but labelled data for many underwater species are severely lacking. semi-supervised trackers may offer alternative tracking solutions because they require less data than fully-supervised counterparts. however, because there are not existing realistic underwater tracking datasets, the performance of semi-supervised tracking algorithms in the marine domain is not well understood. to better evaluate their performance and utility, in this paper we provide (1) a novel dataset specific to marine animals located at http://warp.whoi.edu/vmat/, (2) an evaluation of state-of-the-art semi-supervised algorithms in the context of underwater animal tracking, and (3) an evaluation of real-world performance through demonstrations using a semi-supervised algorithm on-board an autonomous underwater vehicle to track marine animals in the wild.",AB_0616
"shp2 is a phosphatase/adaptor protein that plays an important role in various signaling pathways. its mutations are associated with cancers and developmental diseases. shp2 contains a protein tyrosine phosphatase (ptp) and two sh2 domains. selective inhibition of these domains has been challenging due to the multitude of homologous proteins in the proteome. here, we developed a monobody, synthetic binding protein, that bound to and inhibited the shp2 ptp domain. it was selective to shp2 ptp over close homologs. a crystal structure of the monobody-ptp complex revealed that the monobody bound both highly conserved residues in the active site and less conserved residues in the periphery, rational-izing its high selectivity. its epitope overlapped with the interface between the ptp and n-terminal sh2 domains that is formed in auto-inhibited shp2. by using the monobody as a probe for the accessibility of the ptp active site, we developed a simple, nonenzymatic assay for the allosteric regulation of shp2. the assay showed that, in the absence of an activating phospho-tyr ligand, wild-type shp2 and the ptp-dead c459e mutant were predominantly in the closed state in which the ptp active site is inaccessible, whereas the e76k and c459s mutants were in the open, active state. it also revealed that previously developed monobodies to the sh2 domains, ligands lacking a phospho-tyr, weakly favored the open state. these results provide corroboration for a conformational equilibrium underlying allosteric reg-ulation of shp2, provide powerful tools for characterizing and controlling shp2 functions, and inform drug discovery against shp2.(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://crea-tivecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0616
"objectives. to measure rates of intimate partner violence (ipv) screening during the perinatal period among people experiencing physical violence in the united states.methods. we used 2016-2019 pregnancy risk assessment monitoring system data (n =158338) to describe the incidence of physical ipv before or during pregnancy. we then assessed the prevalence of ipv screening before, during, or after pregnancy and predictors of receiving screening among those reporting violence.results. among the 3.5% (n = 6259) of respondents experiencing violence, 58.7%, 26.9%, and 48.3% were not screened before, during, or after pregnancy, respectively. those reporting medicaid or no insurance at birth, american indian/alaska native people, and spanish-speaking hispanic people faced increased risk of not having a health care visit during which screening might occur. among those attending a health care visit, privately insured people, rural residents, and non-hispanic white respondents faced increased risk of not being screened.conclusions. among birthing people reporting physical ipv, nearly half were not screened for ipv before or after pregnancy. public health efforts to improve maternal health must address both access to care and universal screening for ipv.

"as a genomic resource provider, grappling with getting a handle on how your resource is utilized can be extremely challenging. at the same time, being able to thus document the plethora of use cases is vital to demonstrate sustainability. herein, we describe a flexible workflow, built on readily available software, that the human disease ontology (do) project has utilized to transition to semi-automated methods to identify uses of the ontology in the published literature. the novel r package do.utils (https://github.com/diseaseontology/do.utils) has been devised with a small set of key functions to support our usage workflow in combination with google sheets. use of this workflow has resulted in a 3-fold increase in the number of identified publications that use the do and has provided novel usage insights that offer new research directions and reveal a clearer picture of the do's use and scientific impact. the do's resource use assessment workflow and the supporting software are designed to be useful to other resources, including databases, software tools, method providers and other web resources, to achieve similar results.",AB_0616
"background: gene-gene co-expression correlations measured by mrna-sequencing (rna-seq) can be used to predict gene annotations based on the co-variance structure within these data. in our prior work, we showed that uniformly aligned rna-seq co-expression data from thousands of diverse studies is highly predictive of both gene annotations and protein-protein interactions. however, the performance of the predictions varies depending on whether the gene annotations and interactions are cell type and tissue specific or agnostic. tissue and cell type-specific gene-gene co-expression data can be useful for making more accurate predictions because many genes perform their functions in unique ways in different cellular contexts. however, identifying the optimal tissues and cell types to partition the global gene-gene co-expression matrix is challenging.results: here we introduce and validate an approach called prediction of gene insights from stratified mammalian gene co-expression (prismexp) for improved gene annotation predictions based on rna-seq gene-gene co-expression data. using uniformly aligned data from archs4, we apply prismexp to predict a wide variety of gene annotations including pathway membership, gene ontology terms, as well as human and mouse phenotypes. predictions made with prismexp outperform predictions made with the global cross-tissue co-expression correlation matrix approach on all tested domains, and training using one annotation domain can be used to predict annotations in other domains.conclusions: by demonstrating the utility of prismexp predictions in multiple use cases we show how prismexp can be used to enhance unsupervised machine learning methods to better understand the roles of understudied genes and proteins. to make prismexp accessible, it is provided via a user-friendly web interface, a python package, and an appyter. availability. the prismexp web-based application, with pre-computed prismexp predictions, is available from: https:// maayanlab.cloud/prismexp; prismexp is also available as an appyter: https:// appyters.maayanlab.cloud/prismexp/; and as python package: https://github.com/ maayanlab/prismexp.",AB_0616
"objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of two technology-enhanced interventions for diabetes prevention among adults at risk for developing diabetes in a primary care setting.methods: the diabeat-it study employed a hybrid 2-group preference (choice) and 3-group randomized controlled (rct) design. this paper presents weight related primary outcomes of the rct arm. patients from southwest virginia were identified through the carilion clinic electronic health records. eligible participants (18 and older, bmi >= 25, no type 2 diabetes) were randomized to either choice (n = 264) or rct (n = 334). rct individuals were further randomized to one of three groups: (1) a 2-h small group class to help patients develop a personal action plan to prevent diabetes (sc, n = 117); (2) a 2-h small group class plus automated telephone calls using an interactive voice response system (ivr) to help participants initiate weight loss through a healthful diet and regular physical activity (class/ivr, n = 110); or (3) a dvd with same content as the class plus the same ivr calls over a period of 12 months (dvd/ivr, n = 107).results: of the 334 participants that were randomized, 232 (69%) had study measured weights at 6 months, 221 (66%) at 12 months, and 208 (62%) at 18 months. class/ivr participants were less likely to complete weight measures than sc or dvd/ivr. intention to treat analyses, controlling for gender, race, age and baseline bmi, showed that dvd/ivr and class/ivr led to reductions in bmi at 6 (dvd/ivr -0.94, p < 0.001; class/ivr -0.70, p < 0.01), 12 (dvd/ivr -0.88, p < 0.001; class/ivr-0.82, p < 0.001) and 18 (dvd/ivr -0.78, p < 0.001; class/ivr -0.58, p < 0.01) months. all three groups showed a significant number of participants losing at least 5% of their body weight at 12 months (dvd/ivr 26.87%; class/ivr 21.62%; sc 16.85%). when comparing groups, dvd/ivr were significantly more likely to decrease bmi at 6 months (p < 0.05) and maintain the reduction at 18 months (p < 0.05) when compared to sc. there were no differences between the other groups.conclusions: the diabeat-it interventions show promise in responding to the need for scalable, effective methods to manage obesity and prevent diabetes in primary care settings that do not over burden primary care clinics and providers.registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct02162901, identifier: nct02162901.",AB_0616
"single-cell rna sequencing technology has enabled in-depth analysis of intercellular heterogeneity in various diseases. however, its full potential for precision medicine has yet to be reached. towards this, we propose a single-cell guided pipeline to aid repurposing of drugs (asgard) that defines a drug score to recommend drugs by considering all cell clusters to address the intercellular heterogeneity within each patient. asgard shows significantly better average accuracy on single-drug therapy compared to two bulk-cell-based drug repurposing methods. we also demonstrated that it performs considerably better than other cell cluster-level predicting methods. in addition, we validate asgard using the drug response prediction method transact with triple-negative-breast-cancer patient samples. we find that many top-ranked drugs are either approved by the food and drug administration or in clinical trials treating corresponding diseases. in conclusion, asgard is a promising drug repurposing recommendation tool guided by single-cell rna-seq for personalized medicine. asgard is free for educational use at https://github.com/lanagarmire/asgard.",AB_0616
"the diva model is a computational model of speech motor control that combines a simulation of the brain regions responsible for speech production with a model of the human vocal tract. the model is currently implemented in matlab simulink; however, this is less than ideal as most of the development in speech technology research is done in python. this means there is a wealth of machine learning tools which are freely available in the python ecosystem that cannot be easily integrated with diva. we present torchdiva, a full rebuild of diva in python using pytorch tensors. diva source code was directly translated from matlab to python, and built-in simulink signal blocks were implemented from scratch. after implementation, the accuracy of each module was evaluated via systematic block-by-block validation. the torchdiva model is shown to produce outputs that closely match those of the original diva model, with a negligible difference between the two. we additionally present an example of the extensibility of torchdiva as a research platform. speech quality enhancement in torchdiva is achieved through an integration with an existing pytorch generative vocoder called diffwave. a modified diffwave mel-spectrum upsampler was trained on human speech waveforms and conditioned on the torchdiva speech production. the results indicate improved speech quality metrics in the diffwave-enhanced output as compared to the baseline. this enhancement would have been difficult or impossible to accomplish in the original matlab implementation. this proof-of-concept demonstrates the value torchdiva can bring to the research community. researchers can download the new implementation at: https://github.com/skinahan/diva_pytorch.",AB_0616
"the power of next-generation sequencing has resulted in an explosive growth in the number of projects aiming to understand the metagenomic diversity of complex microbial environments. the interdisciplinary nature of this microbiome research community, along with the absence of reporting standards for microbiome data and samples, poses a significant challenge for follow-up studies. commonly used names of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes in public databases currently lack the essential information necessary to accurately describe and classify the underlying samples, which makes a comparative analysis difficult to conduct and often results in misclassified sequences in data repositories. the genomes online database (gold) (https:// gold.jgi.doe.gov/) at the department of energy joint genome institute has been at the forefront of addressing this challenge by developing a standardized nomenclature system for naming microbiome samples. gold, currently in its twenty-fifth anniversary, continues to enrich the research community with hundreds of thousands of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes with well-curated and easy-to-understand names. through this manuscript, we describe the overall naming process that can be easily adopted by researchers worldwide. additionally, we propose the use of this naming system as a best practice for the scientific community to facilitate better interoperability and reusability of microbiome data.",AB_0616
