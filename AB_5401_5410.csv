"the mousepost 1.0 online search tool, launched in 2017, allowed to search for variations in all protein-coding gene sequences of 36 sequenced mouse inbred strains, compared to the reference strain c57bl/6j, which could be linked to strain-specific phenotypes and modifier effects. because recently these genome sequences have been significantly updated and sequences of 16 extra strains added by the mouse genomes project, a profound update, correction and expansion of the mousepost 1.0 database has been performed and is reported here. moreover, we have added a new class of protein disturbing sequence polymorphisms (besides stop codon losses, stop codon gains, small insertions and deletions, and missense mutations), namely start codon mutations. the current version, mousepost 2.0 (https://mousepost.be), therefore is a significantly updated and invaluable tool available to the community and is described here and foreseen by multiple examples.",AB_0541

"the 3d point clouds are increasingly being used in various application including safety -critical fields. it has recently been demonstrated that deep neural networks can successfully process 3d point clouds. however, these deep networks can be misclassified via 3d adversarial attacks intentionality designed to perturb some point cloud's features. these misclassifications may be due to the network's overreliance on features with unnecessary information in training sets. as such, identifying the features used by deep classifiers and removing features with unnecessary information from the training data can improve network's robustness against adversarial attacks. in this paper, the lpf-defense framework is proposed to discard this unnecessary information from the training data by suppressing the high-frequency content in the training phase. our analysis shows that adversarial perturbations are found in the high-frequency contents of adversarial point clouds. experiments showed that the proposed defense method achieves the state-of-the-art defense performance against six adversarial attacks on pointnet, pointnet++, and dgcnn models. the findings are practically supported by an expansive evaluation of synthetic (modelnet40 and shapenet) and real datasets (scanobjectnn). in particular, improvements are achieved with an average increase of classification accuracy by 3.8% on drop100 attack and 4.26% on drop200 attack compared to the state-of-the-art methods. the method also improves models' accuracy on the original dataset compared to other available methods.

"monocular 3d human pose estimation has made progress in recent years. most of the methods focus on single persons, which estimate the poses in the person-centric coordinates, i.e., the coordinates based on the center of the target person. hence, these methods are inapplicable for multi-person 3d pose estimation, where the absolute coordinates (e.g., the camera coordinates) are required. moreover, multi-person pose estimation is more challenging than single pose estimation, due to inter-person occlusion and close human interactions. existing top-down multi-person methods rely on human detection (i.e., top-down approach), and thus suffer from the detection errors and cannot produce reliable pose estimation in multi-person scenes. meanwhile, existing bottom-up methods that do not use human detection are not affected by detection errors, but since they process all persons in a scene at once, they are prone to errors, particularly for persons in small scales. to address all these challenges, we propose the integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches to exploit their strengths. our top-down network estimates human joints from all persons instead of one in an image patch, making it robust to possible erroneous bounding boxes. our bottom-up network incorporates human-detection based normalized heatmaps, allowing the network to be more robust in handling scale variations. finally, the estimated 3d poses from the top-down and bottom-up networks are fed into our integration network for final 3d poses. to address the common gaps between training and testing data, we do optimization during the test time, by refining the estimated 3d human poses using high-order temporal constraint, re-projection loss, and bone length regularizations. we also introduce a two-person pose discriminator that enforces natural two-person interactions. finally, we apply a semi-supervised method to overcome the 3d ground-truth data scarcity. our evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its individual components. our code and pretrained models are available publicly: https://github.com/3dpose/3d-multi-person-pose.",AB_0541
"a key analysis task in mass spectrometry proteomics is matching the acquired tandem mass spectra to their originating peptides by sequence database searching or spectral library searching. machine learning is an increasingly popular postprocessing approach to maximize the number of confident spectrum identifications that can be obtained at a given false discovery rate threshold. here, we have integrated semisupervised machine learning in the ann-solo tool, an efficient spectral library search engine that is optimized for open modification searching to identify peptides with any type of post-translational modification. we show that machine learning rescoring boosts the number of spectra that can be identified for both standard searching and open searching, and we provide insights into relevant spectrum characteristics harnessed by the machine learning model. the semisupervised machine learning functionality has now been fully integrated into ann-solo, which is available as open source under the permissive apache 2.0 license on github at https://github.com/bittremieux/ann-solo.",AB_0541
"deep learning applications have been widely adopted on edge devices, to mitigate the privacy and latency issues of accessing cloud servers. deciding the number of neurons during the design of a deep neural network to maximize performance is not intuitive. particularly, many application scenarios are real-time and have a strict latency constraint, while conventional neural network optimization methods do not directly change the temporal cost of model inference for latency-critical edge systems. in this work, we propose a latency-oriented neural network learning method to optimize models for high accuracy while fulfilling the latency constraint. for efficiency, we also introduce a universal hardware-customized latency predictor to optimize this procedure to learn a model that satisfies the latency constraint by only a one-shot training process. the experiment results reveal that, compared to state -of-the-art methods, our approach can well-fit the 'hard' latency constraint and achieve high accuracy. under the same training settings as the original model and satisfying a 34 ms latency constraint on the imagenet-100 dataset, we reduce googlenet's latency from 40.32 ms to 34 ms with a 0.14% accuracy reduction on the nvidia jetson nano. when coupled with quantization, our method can be further improved to only 0.04% drop for googlenet. on the nvidia jetson tx2, we compress vgg-19 from 119.98 ms to 34 ms and even improve its accuracy by 0.5%, and we scale googlenet up from 20.27 ms to 34 ms and achieve higher accuracy by 0.78%. we also open source this framework at https://github.com/ntuliuteam/zerobn.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0541
"machine and deep learning survival models demonstrate similar or even improved time-to-event prediction capabilities compared to classical statistical learning methods yet are too complex to be interpreted by humans. several model-agnostic explanations are available to overcome this issue; how-ever, none directly explain the survival function prediction. in this paper, we introduce survshap(t), the first time-dependent explanation that allows for interpreting survival black-box models. it is based on shapley additive explanations with solid theoretical foundations and a broad adoption among machine learning practitioners. the proposed methods aim to enhance precision diagnostics and support domain experts in making decisions. experiments on synthetic and medical data confirm that survshap(t) can detect variables with a time-dependent effect, and its aggregation is a better deter-minant of the importance of variables for a prediction than survlime. survshap(t) is model-agnostic and can be applied to all models with functional output. we provide an accessible implementation of time-dependent explanations in python at https://github.com/mi2datalab/survshap.

"motivation: recent experimental evidence has shown that some long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) contain small open reading frames (sorfs) that are translated into functional micropeptides, suggesting that these lncrnas are misannotated as non-coding. current methods to detect misannotated lncrnas rely on ribosome-profiling (ribo-seq) and mass-spectrometry experiments, which are cell-type dependent and expensive. results: here, we propose a computational method to identify possible misannotated lncrnas from sequence information alone. our approach first builds deep learning models to discriminate coding and non-coding transcripts and leverages these models' training dynamics to identify misannotated lncrnas-i.e. lncrnas with coding potential. the set of misannotated lncrnas we identified significantly overlap with experimentally validated ones and closely resemble coding protein sequences as evidenced by significant blast hits. our analysis on a subset of misannotated lncrna candidates also shows that some orfs they contain yield high confidence folded structures as predicted by alphafold2. this methodology offers promising potential for assisting experimental efforts in characterizing the hidden proteome encoded by misannotated lncrnas and for curating better datasets for building coding potential predictors. availability and implementation: source code is available at https://github.com/nabiafshan/detectingmisannotatedlncrnas. contact: otastan@sabanciuniv.edu supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0541
"semi-supervised nonnegative matrix factorization exploits the strengths of matrix factorization in suc-cessfully learning part-based representation and is also able to achieve high learning performance when facing a scarcity of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. its major challenge lies in how to learn more discriminative representations from limited labeled data. furthermore, self-supervised learn-ing has been proven very effective at learning representations from unlabeled data in various learning tasks. recent research works focus on utilizing the capacity of self-supervised learning to enhance semi-supervised learning. in this paper, we design an effective self-supervised semi-supervised nonnegative matrix factorization (s4nmf) in a semi-supervised clustering setting. the s4nmf directly extracts a con-sensus result from ensembled nmfs with similarity and dissimilarity regularizations. in an iterative pro-cess, this self-supervisory information will be fed back to the proposed model to boost semi-supervised learning and form more distinct clusters. the proposed iterative algorithm is used to solve the given problem, which is defined as an optimization problem with a well-formulated objective function. in ad-dition, the theoretical and empirical analyses investigate the convergence of the proposed optimization algorithm. to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in semi-supervised clustering, we con-duct extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets. the source code for reproducing our results can be found at https://github.com/chavoshinejad/s4nmf .(c) 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0541
"with the global emergence of drug-resistant bacteria causing difficult-to-treat infections, there is an urgent need for a tool to facilitate studies on key virulence and antimicrobial resistant factors. mass spectrometry (ms) has contributed substantially to the elucidation of the structure-function relationships of lipid a, the endotoxic component of lipopolysaccharide which also serves as an important protective barrier against antimicrobials. here, we present lipida-ider, an automated structure annotation tool for system-level scale identification of lipid a from high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (ms2) data. lipida-ider was validated against previously reported structures of lipid a in the reference bacteria, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. using ms2 data of variable quality, we demonstrated lipida-ider annotated lipid a with a performance of 71.2% specificity and 70.9% sensitivity, offering greater accuracy than existing lipidomics software. the organism-independent workflow was further applied to a panel of six bacterial species: e. coli and gram-negative members of eskape pathogens. a comprehensive atlas comprising 188 distinct lipid a species, including remodeling intermediates, was generated and can be integrated with software including ms-dial and metabokit for identification and semiquantitation. systematic comparison of a pair of polymyxin-sensitive and polymyxin-resistant acinetobacter baumannii isolated from a human patient unraveled multiple key lipid a structural features of polymyxin resistance within a single analysis. probing the lipid a landscape of bacteria using lipida-ider thus holds immense potential for advancing our understanding of the vast diversity and structural complexity of a key lipid virulence and antimicrobial-resistant factor. lipida-ider is freely available at https://github.com/systemsbiology-of-lipid-metabolism-lab/lipida-ider.",AB_0541
