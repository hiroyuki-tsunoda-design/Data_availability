"background: basal cell carcinoma of the perianal region is a rare anorectal disease. this condition is not related to exposure to ultraviolet radiation. because of the low prevalence and poor detection, there is a paucity of data relating to this condition in the literature. perianal basal cell carcinoma presents surgical challenges different from other anatomic locations and may not share the same prevalence or natural history. here, we describe the largest series to date on the surgical management of perianal basal cell carcinoma. objective: we aimed to present our 35-year experience in managing perianal basal cell carcinoma in this study. design: this was a retrospective single-center analysis. setting: the study was conducted at a large tertiary referral academic health care system. patients: all patients undergoing surgical management of pathology confirmed perianal basal cell carcinoma. interventions: all patients underwent surgical management of their disease. main outcome measures: the primary outcomes were disease recurrence, mortality, and wound complications. results: a total of 29 patients were identified with an average follow-up of 5.5 years. at index presentation, 27.6% of patients had multiple basal cell carcinoma in other anatomic locations. ninety-three percent of patients were adequately treated with local excision, but 60% had wound dehiscence at the time of their first follow-up visit. ultimately, there were no recurrences or disease-related mortality during the follow-up period. limitations: limitations to our study include its nonrandomized retrospective nature, single-institution experience, and small patient sample size. conclusions: perianal basal cell carcinoma carries a high rate of synchronous presentation in other locations and should prompt a thorough evaluation. perianal basal cell carcinomas can and should be successfully treated with local excision despite the high rate of wound complications. see video abstract at http://links.lww. com/dcr/b883.",AB_0590
"background: perianal fistula is a debilitating disease and challenging condition to treat. recently, the use of stem cells has been shown to improve healing of fistulas. objective: the aim was to examine the use of an umbilical cord-derived stem cell graft in a pilot study as a novel scaffold/stem inlay implanted into fistula repairs for anovaginal fistula to examine healing rates. design: this was a pilot study. settings: this study took place in a colorectal surgery practice. patients: patients with anovaginal fistula consented to participate. cryopreserved umbilical cord tissue graft with viable cells was incorporated as an inlay using a previously reported technique by the authors. demographic data including history of previous repairs and ibd were included. all patients were followed for a minimum of 6 weeks. main outcome measures: the primary measures were safety and efficacy of novel stem cell graft in the treatment of anovaginal fistula. results: from september 2017 to september 2019, 15 patients underwent anovaginal fistula repair. three of these patients underwent a second repair, for a total of 18 repairs. no patient was intentionally diverted, but 3 patients presented for repair with a preexisting stoma. the majority of repairs were previous repair failures (12; 67%), and 7 repairs were performed on 5 patients with ibd. median follow-up was 30 (6-104) weeks. the safety profile for cryopreserved umbilical cord tissue graft was excellent as no adverse events occurred. overall complete healing rate was 39%, and 12 (67%) repairs resulted in improvement of symptoms. limitations: this was a small pilot study. conclusions: this is the largest series using cryopreserved umbilical cord graft for anovaginal fistula repair. the use of umbilical cord was safe and effective at closing defects. randomized studies are necessary to determine added benefits over current standard of care. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b896.",AB_0590
"background: fecal incontinence affects 7% to 12% of the us adult population, causing social, financial, and quality of life burdens. objective: the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nonanimal stabilized hyaluronic acid/dextranomer through 36 months as a condition of postmarket approval application. design: this was a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, observational food and drug administration-mandated postapproval clinical study. settings: this study was designed and executed by participating centers in 18 hospitals and colorectal health clinics in coordination with the food and drug administration and the study sponsor. patients: a total of 283 subjects who previously failed conservative therapy were enrolled across 18 us sites. interventions: participants received 1 to 2 nonanimal stabilized hyaluronic acid/dextranomer treatments. the first treatment occurred within 30 days of baseline, and a second treatment was administered 1 to 3 months after initial treatment if determined necessary by the physician. subjects were followed through 7 visits over 36 months after last treatment. main outcome measures: efficacy (as specified by the food and drug administration) was measured as a fecal incontinence reintervention rate of <50% at 36 months. reintervention included nonanimal stabilized hyaluronic acid/dextranomer re-treatment, surgical interventions, and physical therapy. safety was measured by device-related adverse events. secondary end points included fecal incontinence quality of life scale and cleveland clinic florida fecal incontinence score. results: using a bayesian estimate, the reintervention rate of the intention-to-treat population (n = 283) was 18.9% (95% ci, 14.0-24.4) at 36 months. at 36 months, the reintervention rate for subjects with complete data (n = 192) was 20.8% (95% ci, 15.1-26.6). significant improvement (p < 0.0001) was noted across the cleveland clinic florida fecal incontinence score and fecal incontinence quality of life subscales at 36 months. ninety-two device-related adverse events were reported by 15.2% of enrolled patients; most were gi disorders and resolved quickly. there were no serious adverse events. limitations: limitations of the study included a 32% attrition rate and homogeneous patient population (91.8% white; 85.5% female), possibly limiting generalizability. conclusions: nonanimal stabilized hyaluronic acid/dextranomer demonstrated clinically significant, sustained improvement in symptoms and quality of life for fecal incontinence patients without the occurrence of any serious adverse events. see video abstract at http:// links.lww.com/dcr/b890.",AB_0590
"patient-specific cardiac modeling combines geometries of the heart derived from medical images and biophysical simulations to predict various aspects of cardiac function. however, generating simulation-suitable models of the heart from patient image data often requires complicated procedures and significant human effort. we present a fast and automated deep-learning method to construct simulation-suitable models of the heart from medical images. the approach constructs meshes from 3d patient images by learning to deform a small set of deformation handles on a whole heart template. for both 3d ct and mr data, this method achieves promising accuracy for whole heart reconstruction, consistently outperforming prior methods in constructing simulation-suitable meshes of the heart. when evaluated on time-series ct data, this method produced more anatomically and temporally consistent geometries than prior methods, and was able to produce geometries that better satisfy modeling requirements for cardiac flow simulations. our source code and pretrained networks are available at https://github.com/fkong7/heartdeformnets.",AB_0590
"mapping the connectome of the human brain using structural or functional connectivity has become one of the most pervasive paradigms for neuroimaging analysis. recently, graph neural networks (gnns) motivated from geometric deep learning have attracted broad interest due to their established power for modeling complex networked data. despite their superior performance in many fields, there has not yet been a systematic study of how to design effective gnns for brain network analysis. to bridge this gap, we present braingb, a benchmark for brain network analysis with gnns. braingb standardizes the process by (1) summarizing brain network construction pipelines for both functional and structural neuroimaging modalities and (2) modularizing the implementation of gnn designs. we conduct extensive experiments on datasets across cohorts and modalities and recommend a set of general recipes for effective gnn designs on brain networks. to support open and reproducible research on gnn-based brain network analysis, we host the braingb website at https://braingb.us with models, tutorials, examples, as well as an out-of-box python package. we hope that this work will provide useful empirical evidence and offer insights for future research in this novel and promising direction.",AB_0590
"background: in patients with ulcerative colitis who undergo ipaa, a diverting ileostomy is used to diminish the severity of anastomotic complications. typically, the ileostomy is closed after an interval of 2 to 4 months. the safety of earlier closure of the ileostomy after pouch surgery is unknown. objective: this study aimed to compare postoperative outcomes in patients randomly assigned to early (7-12 days) or late (>= 8 weeks) ileostomy closure after ileal pouch construction. design: this was a multicenter, prospective randomized trial. setting: the study was conducted at colorectal surgical units at select united states hospitals. patients: adults with ulcerative colitis who underwent 2- or 3-stage proctocolectomy with ipaa were included. main outcome measures: the primary outcomes included comprehensive complication index at 30 days after ileostomy closure. the secondary outcomes included complications, severe complications, reoperations, and readmissions within 30 days of ileostomy closure. results: the trial was stopped after interim analysis because of a high rate of complications after early ileostomy closure. among 36 patients analyzed, 1 patient (3%) had unplanned proctectomy with end-ileostomy. of the remaining 35 patients, 28 patients (80%) were clinically eligible for early closure and underwent radiologic assessment. there were 3 radiologic failures. of the 25 remaining patients, 22 patients (88%) were randomly assigned to early closure (n = 10) or late closure (n = 12), and 3 patients were excluded. median comprehensive complication index was 14.8 (0-54) and 0 (0-23) after early and late closure (p = 0.02). one or more complications occurred in 7 patients (70%) after early closure and in 2 patients (17%) after late closure (p = 0.01), and complications were severe in 3 patients (30%) after early closure and 0 patients after late closure (p = 0.04). reoperation was required in 1 patient (10%) and 0 patients (p = 0.26) after early closure and readmission was required in 7 patients (70%) and 1 patient (8%) after late closure (p = 0.003). limitations: this study was limited by early study closure and selection bias. conclusions: early closure of a diverting ileostomy in patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent ipaa is associated with an unacceptably high rate of complications. see video abstract at http://links.lww. com/dcr/c68.",AB_0590
"background: transversus abdominis plane blocks improve postoperative pain after colon and rectal resections, but the benefits of liposomal bupivacaine use for these blocks have not been clearly demonstrated. objective: this study aimed to determine whether using liposomal bupivacaine in transversus abdominis plane blocks improves postoperative pain and reduces opioid use after colorectal surgery compared to standard bupivacaine. design: this study was a single-blinded, single-institution, prospective randomized controlled trial comparing liposomal bupivacaine to standard bupivacaine in transversus abdominis plane blocks in patients undergoing elective colon and rectal resections. settings: this study was conducted at a single-institution academic medical center with 6 staff colorectal surgeons and 2 colorectal surgery fellows. patients: ninety-six patients aged 18 to 85 years were assessed for eligibility; 76 were included and randomly assigned to 2 groups of 38 patients. interventions: patients in the experimental group received liposomal bupivacaine transversus abdominis plane blocks, whereas the control group received standard bupivacaine blocks. main outcome measures: the primary outcome was maximum pain score on postoperative day 2. secondary outcomes included daily maximum and average pain scores in the 3 days after surgery, as well as daily morphine milligram equivalent use and length of hospital stay. results: patients receiving liposomal bupivacaine blocks had lower maximum pain scores on the day of surgery (mean, 6.5 vs 7.7; p = 0.008). no other difference was found between groups with respect to maximum or average pain scores at any time point postoperatively, nor was there any difference in morphine milligram equivalents used or length of stay (median, 3.1 d). limitations: this was a single-institution study with only patients blinded to group assignment. conclusions: liposomal bupivacaine use in transversus abdominis plane blocks for patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resections does not seem to improve postoperative pain, nor does it reduce narcotic use or decrease length of stay. given its cost, use of liposomal bupivacaine in transversus abdominis plane blocks is not justified for colon and rectal resections. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b979.",AB_0590
"background: colorectal resections have relatively high rates of surgical site infections causing significant morbidity. incisional negative pressure wound therapy was introduced to improve wound healing of closed surgical incisions and to prevent surgical site infections. objective: this randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the effect of incisional npwt on superficial surgical site infections in high-risk, open, reoperative colorectal surgery. design: this was a single-center randomized controlled trial conducted between july 2015-october 2020. patients were randomly assigned to incisional negative pressure wound therapy or standard gauze dressing with a 1:1 ratio. a total of 298 patients were included. settings: this study was conducted at the colorectal surgery department of a tertiary-level hospital. patients: this study included patients older than 18 years who underwent elective reoperative open colorectal resections. patients were excluded who had open surgery within the past 3 months, who had active surgical site infection, and who underwent laparoscopic procedures. main outcome measures: the primary outcome was superficial surgical site infection within 30 days. secondary outcomes were deep and organ-space surgical site infections within 7 days and 30 days, postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay. results: a total of 149 patients were included in each arm. the mean age was 51 years, and 49.5% were women. demographics, preoperative comorbidities, and preoperative albumin levels were comparable between the groups. overall, most surgeries were performed for ibd, and 77% of the patients had an ostomy fashioned during the surgery. no significant difference was found between the groups in 30-day superficial surgical site infection rate (14.1% in control versus 9.4% in incisional negative pressure wound therapy; p = 0.28). deep and organ-space surgical site infections rates at 7 and 30 days were also comparable between the groups. postoperative length of stay and complication rates (clavien-dindo grade) were also comparable between the groups. limitations: the patient population included in the trial consisted of a selected group of high-risk patients. conclusions: incisional negative pressure wound therapy was not associated with reduced superficial surgical site infection or overall complication rates in patients undergoing high-risk reoperative colorectal resections. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b956.",AB_0590
"background: previous disparities research has demonstrated that underrepresented racial minority patients have worse colorectal cancer outcomes and that they experience unnecessary delays in time to treatment. these delays may explain worse colorectal cancer outcomes for minority patients and serve as a marker of inequalities in our healthcare system. objective: this study aims to quantify the mechanisms that contribute to this disparity in treatment delay. design: this is a retrospective analysis of colorectal cancer patients who underwent elective resection from 2004 to 2017. a causal inference mediation analysis using the counterfactual framework was utilized to estimate the extent to which racial disparities among patient factors explain the racial disparities in time to treatment. mediators included income, education, comorbidities, insurance, and hospital type. settings: this study was conducted at hospitals participating in the national cancer database. patients: stage i-iii colorectal cancer patients, >= 18 years old, who underwent elective resection from 2004 through 2017 were included. main outcomes measures: the primary measures were indirect effects of mediators between race and delayed time to treatment. results: of the 504,405 patients (370,051 colon and 134,354 rectal), 10%, 5%, and 4% were black, hispanic, and other. in multivariable models, compared to white patients, these patients had 25%, 27%, and 17% greater odds of delayed treatment. mediation analyses suggested that 43%, 20%, and 31% of the treatment delay among them could be removed if an intervention equalized income, education, comorbidities, insurance, and hospital type to that of white patients. treatment at an academic hospital explained 15% to 32% of the racial disparity and was the most potent mediator. limitations: this study was limited by its retrospective design and failure to capture all meaningful mediators. conclusions: black, hispanic, and other colorectal cancer patients experience treatment delays when compared to white patients. equalization of the mediators used in this study could reduce treatment delays by 20% to 43% depending on the racial/ethnic group. future research should identify other causes of racial disparities in treatment delay and intervene accordingly. see video abstract at http://links. lww. com/dcr/b871.",AB_0590
"objective: to report on broad-based outcomes of the brief behavioral therapy (bbt) trial for pediatric anxiety and depression. secondary data analyses expand on previous reports by assessing diagnostic remission and independent functioning, impact on targeted psychopathology, and spillover effects on non-targeted outcomes. method: youth (n = 185; 8-16.9 years; 58% female; 78% white; 21% hispanic) with anxiety and/or depression were eligible for this multi-site trial. enrolled youth were randomly assigned to receive 8 to 12 sessions of bbt in primary care or assisted referral to outpatient care (arc). assessments were conducted 16 and 32 weeks post randomization.results: bbt was superior to arc on remission of all targeted diagnoses (week 16: 56.8% vs 28.2%, p < .001; week 32: 62.5% vs 38.9%, p = .004), clinician-rated independent functioning (week 16: 75.0% vs 45.7%, p < .001; week 32: 81.2% vs 55.7%, p < .001), and on measures of anxiety, depression, suicide items, total comorbid behavioral and emotional problems, and hyperactivity (d = 0.21-0.49). moderation analyses revealed superior outcomes for hispanic youth in bbt vs arc for diagnostic remission, anxiety, emotional problems, and parent-child conflict. youth depression at baseline moderated effects on peer problems and parent-child conflict, with effects favoring bbt. significant main and moderated effects of bbt on change in non-targeted outcomes were largely mediated by change in anxiety (24.2%-49.3% of total effects mediated).conclusion: bbt has positive effects on youth, mediated by the strong impact of the intervention on anxiety. analyses continue to support positive outcomes for hispanic youth, suggesting that bbt is a broadly effective transdiagnostic treatment option for diverse populations. clinical trial registration information: brief cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) for pediatric anxiety and depression in primary care; https:// clinicaltrials.gov; nct01147614.",AB_0590
