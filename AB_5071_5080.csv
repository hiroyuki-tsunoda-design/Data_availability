"metabolism helps in the elimination of drugs from the human body by making them more hydrophilic. sometimes, drugs can be bioactivated to highly reactive metabolites or intermediates during metabolism. these reactive metabolites are often responsible for the toxicities associated with the drugs. identification of reactive metabolites of drug candidates can be very helpful in the initial stages of drug discovery. quinones are soft electrophiles that are generated as reactive intermediates during metabolism. quinones make up more than 40% of the reactive metabolites. in this work, a reliable data set of 510 molecules was used to develop machine learning and deep learning-based predictive models to predict the formation of quinone-type metabolites. for representing molecules, two-dimensional (2d) descriptors, pubchem fingerprints, electro-topological state (e-state) fingerprints, and metabolic reactivity-based descriptors were used. developed models were compared to the existing xenosite web server using the untouched test set of 102 molecules. the best model achieved an accuracy of 86.27%, while the xenosite server could achieve an accuracy of only 52.94% on the test set. descriptor analysis revealed that the presence of greater numbers of polar moieties in a molecule can prevent the formation of quinone-type metabolites. in addition, the presence of a nitrogen atom in an aromatic ring and the presence of metabolophores v51, v52, and v53 (smartcyp descriptors) decrease the probability of quinone formation. finally, a tool based on the best machine learning models was developed, which is accessible at http://14.139.57.41/quinonepred/.",AB_0508
"recessive variants in gjb2 are the most important genetic cause of sensorineural hearing impairment (snhi) worldwide. phenotypes vary significantly in gjb2-related snhi, even in patients with identical variants. for instance, patients homozygous for the gjb2 p.v37i variant, which is highly prevalent in the asian populations, usually present with mild-to-moderate snhi; yet severe-to-profound snhi is occasionally observed in approximately 10% of p.v37i homozygotes. to investigate the genomic un-derpinnings of the phenotypic variability, we performed next-generation sequencing of gjb2 and other deafness genes in 63 p.v37i homozygotes with extreme phenotypic severities. additional pathogenic variants of other deafness genes were identified in five of the 35 patients with severe-to-profound snhi. furthermore, case-control association analyses were conducted for 30 unrelated p.v37i homo-zygotes with severe-to-profound snhi against 28 p.v37i homozygotes with mild-to-moderate snhi, and 120 population controls from the taiwan biobank. the severe-to-profound group exhibited a higher frequency of the crystallin lambda 1 (cryl1) variant (rs14236), located upstream of gjb2 , than the mild-to-moderate and taiwan biobank groups. our results demonstrated that pathogenic variants in other deafness genes and a possible modifier, the cryl1 rs14236 variant, may contribute to phenotypic variability in gjb2-realted snhi, highlighting the importance of comprehensive genomic surveys to delineate the genotype-phenotype correlations.

"g-quadruplexes (g4s) are secondary structures in dna that have been shown to be involved in gene regulation. they play a vital role in the cellular processes and several pathogens including bacteria, fungi, and viruses have also been shown to possess g4s that help them in their pathogenesis. additionally, cross-talk among the cpg islands and g4s has been shown to influence biological processes. the virus-encoded g4s are affected by the mutational landscape leading to the formation/deletion of these g4s. therefore, understanding and predicting these multivariate effects on traditional and non-traditional quadruplexes forms an important area of research, that is, yet to be investigated. we have designed a user-friendly webserver qufind (http://soodlab.com/qufinder/) that can predict traditional as well as non-traditional quadruplexes in a given sequence. qufind is connected with ensembl and ncbi so that the sequences can be fetched in a real-time manner. the algorithm is designed in such a way that the user is provided with multiple options to customize the base (a, t, g, or c), size of the stem (2-5), loop length (1-30), number of bulges (1-5) as well as the number of mismatches (0-2) enabling the identification of any of the secondary structure as per their interest. qufind is designed to predict both cpg islands as well as g4s in a given sequence. since g4s are very short as compared to the cpg islands, hence, qufind can also predict the overlapping g4s within cpg islands. therefore, the user has the flexibility to identify either overlapping or non-overlapping g4s along with the cpg islands. additionally, one section of qufind is dedicated to comparing the g4s in two viral sequences. the visualization is designed in such a manner that the user is able to see the unique quadruplexes in both the input sequences. the efficiency of qufind is calculated on g4s obtained from g4 high throughput sequencing data (n = 1000) or experimentally validated g4s (n = 329). our results revealed that qufind is able to predict g4-quadruplexes obtained from g4-sequencing data with 90.06% prediction accuracy whereas experimentally validated quadruplexes were predicted with 97.26% prediction accuracy.",AB_0508
"biochemical networks integrate enzyme-mediated substrate conversions with non-enzymatic complex formation and disassembly to accomplish complex biochemical and physiological functions. the choice of parameters and constraints used in most of these studies is numerically motivated and network-specific. although sound in theory, the outcomes that result depart significantly from the intracellular milieu and are less likely to retain relevance in a clinical setting. there is a need for a computational tool which is biochemically relevant, mathematically rigorous, and unbiased, and can ascribe functionality to and generate potentially testable hypotheses for a user-defined biochemical network. here, we present redirection, an r-package which computes the probable dissociation constant for every reaction of a biochemical network directly from a null space-generated subspace of the stoichiometry number matrix of the modeled network. redirection delineates this subspace by excluding all trivial and redundant or duplicate occurrences of non-trivial vectors, combinatorially summing the vectors that remain and verifying that the upper or lower bounds of the sequence of terms formed by each row of this subspace belong to the open real-valued intervals( -infinity, - 1) or (1 ,infinity) or whether the number of terms that are differently signed are almost equal. redirection iterates these steps until these bounds are consistent and unambiguous for all reactions of the modeled biochemical network. thereafter, redirection filters the terms from each row of this subspace, bins them to outcome-specific subsets, sums and maps this to an outcome-specific reaction vector, and computes the p1-norm, which is the probable dissociation constant for a reaction. redirection works on first principles, does not discriminate between enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions, offers a biochemically relevant and mathematically rigorous environment to explore user-defined biochemical networks under baseline and perturbed conditions, and can be used to address empirically intractable biochemical problems. the utility and relevance of redirection are highlighted by numerical studies on stoichiometric number models of biochemical networks of galactose metabolism and heme and cholesterol biosynthesis. redirection is freely available and accessible from the comprehensive r archive network (cran) with the url (https://cran.r-project.org/package=redirection).",AB_0508
"the molecular and functional diversity generated by chimeric transcripts (cts) that are derived from two genes is indicated to contribute to tumor cell survival. several gaps yet exist. the present research is a systematic study of the spectrum of cts identified in rna sequencing datasets of 160 ovarian cancer samples in the the cancer genome atlas (tcga) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov). structural annotation revealed complexities emerging from chromosomal localization of partner genes, differential splicing and inclusion of regulatory, untranslated regions. identification of phenotype-specific associations further resolved a dynamically modulated mesenchymal signature during transformation. on an evolutionary background, protein-coding cts were indicated to be highly conserved, while non-coding cts may have evolved more recently. we also realized that the current premise postulating structural alterations or neighbouring gene readthrough generating cts is not valid in instances wherein the parental genes are genomically distanced. in addressing this lacuna, we identified the essentiality of specific spatiotemporal arrangements mediated gene proximities in 3d space for the generation of cts. all these features together suggest non-random mechanisms towards increasing the molecular diversity in a cell through chimera formation either in parallel or with cross-talks with the indigenous regulatory network.",AB_0508
"there are many spectral bands of different wavelengths present in hyperspectral image containing a huge amount of information that helps to detect and identify various objects. many challenges are faced at the time of analyzing a hyperspectral image like information loss, hindrances posed by redundant information lingering on input data and the presence of high dimensions, etc. in this paper, we proposed a resnet convlstm model which is composed of a 2d convolution neural network together with batch normalization and it helps to minimize the computational complexity and to extract features from hyperspectral image. at the same time, we added skip connections to eliminate the vanishing gradient problem, being followed by the long short term memory layer to remove redundant information from an input image. we implemented our model on three different types of hyperspectral data sets and also on three different types of time series data sets. our model produced better accuracy than others' proposed models reaching the levels of 0.07%, 0.01%, and 0.56% more in the indian pines, pavia university, and botswana data sets respectively. the commitment of our errors decreased in time series datasets by 0.44, 0.08, and 0.5 in electricity production, international airline passenger and production of shampoo over three years respectively. the source code is available at https://github.com/anasua-coding/hsi-classification/tree/main.",AB_0508
"neurodegenerative disorders like alzheimer's disease (ad) are irreversible and show atrophies in the area of the cerebral cortex of brain. ad leads to loss of memory and other cognitive impairments. the ad subjects are evaluated based on magnetic resonance imaging scans. the data may have the problem of class imbalance, noise and outliers which is a great challenge for classification. support vector machines and twin support vector machine-based classifiers may not effectively deal with these problems as both these models assume that all the samples are equally important for the separating hyperplane. to overcome these issues, we propose intuitionistic fuzzy least square twin support vector machine for class imbalance problems (iflstsvm) and class specific-iflstsvm (cs-iflstsvm). to minimize the effects of class imbalance, the samples are appropriately weighted to minimize their effect on the optimal hyperplane. moreover, we use intuitionistic fuzzy scores to overcome the issues of noise and outliers. intuitionistic fuzzy score values generate appropriate weights by considering both the distance of the samples from the class centroid as well as the heterogeneity of the samples. the proposed models iflstsvm and cs-iflstsvm are efficient as they need to solve a system of linear equations. in alzheimer's disease diagnosis, the proposed iflstsvm and cs-iflstsvm models showed better performance in mci_vs_ad and cn_vs_mci cases, respectively. moreover, the proposed models showed better performance in the diagnosis of breast cancer classification. the statistical analysis carried out over keel and uci data leads to the superiority of the proposed models. the source code of the proposed model is available at https://github.com/mtanveer1/diagnosis-of-alzheimer-s-disease-via-intuitionistic-fuzzy-leastsquares-twin-svm.",AB_0508
