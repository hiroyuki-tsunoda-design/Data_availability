"inspired by multi-agent systems (mass) and ensemble models, a novel method of vehicle make and model recognition (vmmr) based on a vehicle's front-view images is presented in this paper. by exploiting the attention mechanism in this work, it is demonstrated that most of the features used for classifying a vehicle are extracted from its headlight, grill, scoop, and bumper sections. these areas are designated as the regions of interest (rois) in our approach. contrary to the other methods in which a whole roi is fed to a deep convolutional neural network, in this scheme, different rois are extracted from each image, and then a preprocessing block and a distinctive network are designed for each roi, which is considered as a single agent. each agent is then trained separately, and a vehicle's type is determined with the collaboration of these agents and based on the blackboard classification system. also, a new dataset (deepcar 5.0) is compiled by using the data from the top 50 automakers. this dataset contains 40,185 images of the front views and the front three-quarters of vehicles in 480 different classes, and all the parts of dataset are labeled manually. the proposed technique is able to achieve the accuracies of 92.14 and 96.72% in the automated and the manual scenarios, respectively; and contrary to the current methods, it can perform flawless classification even when just a portion of a vehicle's front view image is available for processing. the dataset and parts of the code are available at: https://github.com/deepcar/deepcar5.0.",AB_0543
"natural language processing technology has made significant progress in recent years, fuelled by increasingly powerful general language models. this has also inspired a sizeable body of work targeted specifically towards the educational domain, where the creation of questions (both for assessment and practice) is a laborious/expensive effort. thus, automatic question-generation (qg) solutions have been proposed and studied. yet, according to a recent survey of the educational qg community's progress, a common baseline dataset unifying multiple domains and question forms (e.g., multiple choice vs. fill-the-gap), including readily available baseline models to compare against, is largely missing. this is the gap we aim to fill with this paper. in particular, we introduce a high-quality dataset in the educational domain, containing over 3,000 entries, comprising (i) multiple-choice questions, (ii) the corresponding answers (including distractors), and (iii) associated passages from the course material used as sources for the questions. each question is phrased in two forms, normal and cloze (i.e., fill-the-gap), and correct answers are linked to source documents with sentence-level annotations. thus, our versatile dataset can be used for both question and distractor generation, as well as to explore new challenges such as question format conversion. furthermore, 903 questions are accompanied by their cognitive complexity level as per bloom's taxonomy. all questions have been generated by educational experts rather than crowd workers to ensure they are maintaining educational and learning standards. our analysis and experiments suggest distinguishable differences between our dataset and commonly used ones for question generation for educational purposes. we believe this new dataset can serve as a valuable resource for research and evaluation in the educational domain. the dataset and baselines are made available to support further research in question generation for education (https://github.com/hadifar/question-generation).",AB_0543
"convolutional neural networks (cnns) are used in many domains but the requirement of large datasets for robust training sessions and no overfitting makes them hard to apply in medical fields and similar fields. however, when large quantities of samples cannot be easily collected, various methods can still be applied to stem the problem depending on the sample type. data augmentation, rather than other methods, has recently been under the spotlight mostly because of the simplicity and effectiveness of some of the more adopted methods. the research question addressed in this work is whether data augmentation techniques can help in developing robust and efficient machine learning systems to be used in different domains for classification purposes. to do that, we introduce new image augmentation techniques that make use of different methods like fourier transform (ft), discrete cosine transform (dct), radon transform (rt), hilbert transform (ht), singular value decomposition (svd), local laplacian filters (llf) and hampel filter (hf). we define different ensemble methods by combining various classical data augmentation methods with the newer ones presented here. we performed an extensive empirical evaluation on 15 different datasets to validate our proposal. the obtained results show that the newly proposed data augmentation methods can be very effective even when used alone. the ensembles trained with different augmentations methods can outperform some of the best approaches reported in the literature as well as compete with state-of-the-art custom methods. all resources are available at https://github.com/lorisnanni.",AB_0543
"background: an intestinal stoma has severe psychosocial effects on patients. objective: this study aimed to measure the effects of prehabilitation on stoma self-care, quality of life, anxiety, and depression levels. design: this study was a a randomized controlled trial. settings: patients were allocated into 3 groups according to enterostomal management: group a (stoma marking and postoperative education), group b (marking and pre- and postoperative education), and group c (prehabilitation group) (marking and preoperative education with introduction of the stoma appliance preoperatively and postoperative education). a stoma care follow-up form, the hospital anxiety and depression scale, and a stoma-specific quality-of-life questionnaire were used for evaluation. patients: patients who underwent colorectal surgery and fecal diversion at the ankara university, ankara, turkey, between 2011 and 2016 were included. main outcome measures: the primary outcome was the effect of stoma prehabilitation on self-care ability. results: two hundred forty patients were included in the study. the outcome of stoma self-care revealed that 24 patients (31.2%) in group a, 51 patients (78.5%) in group b, and 72 patients (94.7%) in group c could perform stoma care independently (p < 0.001). among patients with temporary stomas, group c had a better outcome than patients in groups a and b (p < 0.001). there was no similar relationship among patients with permanent stomas. the prehabilitation group had fewer patients with anxiety and depression than the other groups. among patients with temporary stomas, similar findings were found. no differences were found in either anxiety or depression among patients with permanent stomas. stoma quality-of-life scores were significantly higher in the prehabilitation group (p < 0.001). among patients with temporary stomas, similar findings were found. there was no difference among those with permanent stoma. limitations: this was a single-center study of heterogeneous groups. conclusions: prehabilitation facilitates stoma self-care, decreases predisposition to anxiety and depression and improves quality of life in patients with stomas. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b918.",AB_0543
"drug failures due to unforeseen adverse effects at clinical trials pose health risks for the participants and lead to substantial financial losses. side effect prediction algorithms have the potential to guide the drug design process. lincs l1000 dataset provides a vast resource of cell line gene expression data perturbed by different drugs and creates a knowledge base for context specific features. the state-of-the-art approach that aims at using context specific information relies on only the high-quality experiments in lincs l1000 and discards a large portion of the experiments. in this study, our goal is to boost the prediction performance by utilizing this data to its full extent. we experiment with 5 deep learning architectures. we find that amulti-modal architecture produces the best predictive performance among multi-layer perceptron-based architectureswhen drug chemical structure (cs), and the full set of drug perturbed gene expression profiles (gex) are used asmodalities. overall, we observe that the cs ismore informative than the gex. a convolutional neural network-based model that uses only smiles string representation of the drugs achieves the best results and provides 13.0% macro-auc and 3.1% micro-auc improvements over the state-of-the-art. we also show that the model is able to predict side effect-drug pairs that are reported in the literature but was missing in the ground truth side effect dataset. deepside is available at http://github.com/onuruner/deepside.",AB_0543
"targeting the primary pathogenic event of sickle cell disease (scd), the polymerization of sickle hemoglobin (hbs), may prevent downstream clinical events. mitapivat, an oral pyruvate kinase (pk) activator, has therapeutic potential by increasing adenosine triphosphate (atp) and decreasing 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-dpg), a glycolytic red blood cell (rbc) intermediate. in the previously reported 8-week dose-finding period of this phase 2, investigator-initiated, open-label study, mitapivat was well tolerated and showed efficacy in scd. here, the 1-year fixed-dose extension period is reported in which 9 of 10 included patients (90%) aged >= 16 years with scd (hbss, hbs/beta 0, or hbs/beta+) continued with mitapivat. increase and headache) were still reported. apart from the reported nontreatment-related serious ae (sae) of a urinary tract infection in the dose-finding period, 1 nontreatmentrelated sae occurred in the fixed-dose extension period in a patient who died of massive pulmonary embolism due to covid-19. importantly, sustained improvement in hb level (mean increase, 1.1 +/- 0.7 g/dl; p = .0014) was seen, which was accompanied by decreases in markers of hemolysis. in addition, the annualized rate of vaso-occlusive events reduced significantly from a historic baseline of 1.33 +/- 1.32 to 0.64 +/- 0.87 (p = .0489) when combining the dose-finding period and fixed-dose extension period. cellularly, the atp:2,3-dpg ratio and hb-oxygen affinity significantly increased and rbc sickling (point of sickling) nonsignificantly reduced. overall, this study demonstrated 1-year safety and efficacy of treatment with mitapivat in scd, supporting further evaluation in ongoing phase 2/3 study (rise up, nct05031780). this trial was registered at https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ as nl8517 and eudract 2019-003438-18.",AB_0543
"robot visual navigation is a relevant research topic. current deep navigation models conveniently learn the navigation policies in simulation, given the large amount of experience they need to collect. unfortunately, the resulting models show a limited generalization ability when deployed in the real world. in this work we explore solutions to facilitate the development of visual navigation policies trained in simulation that can be successfully transferred in the real world. we first propose an efficient evaluation tool to reproduce realistic navigation episodes in simulation. we then investigate a variety of deep fusion architectures to combine a set of mid-level representations, with the aim of finding the best merge strategy that maximize the real world performances. our experiments, performed both in simulation and on a robotic platform, show the effectiveness of the considered mid-level representations-based models and confirm the reliability of the evaluation tool. the 3d models of the environment and the code of the validation tool are publicly available at the following link: https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/embodiedvn/.",AB_0543
"background: glenohumeral osteoarthritis (gh oa) is a very common joint disease characterized by pain and functional limitation. no standardized protocols of treatment are available in clinical practice and literature data are confusing. this monocentric randomized open-label study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of a treatment with medium molecular weight hyaluronic acid (ha) compared to a treatment with corticosteroids on patients affected by glenohumeral osteoarthritis.methods: a total of 80 consecutive patients with gh oa (kellegren lawrence grade ii or iii) were randomized in two different groups: hymovis (r) (24 mg/3 ml) (treatment group) and corticosteroids (control group), with a follow-up after 3 and 6 months. modifications in terms of pain, range of motion and quality of life were observed during the treatment.results: after 6 months, the treatment group presented a mean active abduction (abd) of 67.9 degrees +/- 3.6 (baseline 56.4 degrees +/- 4.5, a gain of 11.5 degrees), the mean internal rotation (int) was 14.4 degrees +/- 2.0 (baseline 13.6 degrees +/- 2.1. a gain of 0.8 degrees) and the mean external rotation (ext) was 24.3 degrees +/- 2.5 (baseline 23.5 degrees +/- 2.9, a gain of 0.8 degrees) for patients belonging to the treatment group. the mean constant-murley score (cms) in the treatment group was 76.5 +/- 4.3 (baseline 59.5 +/- 5.4, a gain of 17.0 from the starting point). the mean visual analogue scale (vas) was 4.6 +/- 0.7 (baseline 8.0 +/- 1.1, a reduction of 3.4), and the euroqol-5 dimension (eq-5d) was 70.6 +/- 4.3 (baseline 53.7 +/- 5.1, a gain of 16.9). for patients in the control group, after 6 months, the mean active abd was 60.4 degrees +/- 4.8 (baseline 58.9 degrees +/- 4.8, a gain of 1.5 degrees), the mean int was 15.3 degrees +/- 1.9 (baseline 14.9 degrees +/- 2.0, a gain of 0.4 degrees) and the mean ext was 22.8 degrees +/- 2.1 (baseline 23.5 degrees +/- 2.9, a gain of 0.6 degrees). the mean cms was 66.5 +/- 4.8 points, (baseline 61.2 +/- 4.7, a gain of 5.3). the mean vas score was 7.2 +/- 1.1 (baseline 7.9 +/- 1.1, a reduction of 0.7), and the eq-5d was 62.1 +/- 3.8 (baseline 54.9 +/- 4.7, a gain of 7.2). at 6 months follow-up, patients treated with ha showed a significant reduction in the level of pain and a significant improvement in their daily activities in comparison with the control group.conclusion: the present study demonstrates that patients affected by mild-moderate gh oa treated with two intra-articular injections of ha (hymovis (r) 24 mg/3 ml) achieved better results for a longer duration, in terms of reduction in shoulder pain and improvement in their daily activities, compared to patients treated with two intra-articular injections of corticosteroids.clinical trial registration: no. nct06043544. url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/.",AB_0543
"objective: associations between psychiatric problems and white matter (wm) microstructure have been reported in youth. yet, a deeper under-standing of this relation has been hampered by a dearth of well-powered longitudinal studies and a lack of explicit examination of the bidirectional associations between brain and behavior. we investigated the temporal directionality of wm microstructure and psychiatric symptom associations in youth. method: in this observational study, we leveraged the world's largest single-and multi-site cohorts of neurodevelopment: the generation r (genr) and adolescent brain cognitive development studies (abcd) (total n scans = 11,400; total n = 5,700). we assessed psychiatric symptoms with the child behavioral checklist as broad-band internalizing and externalizing scales, and as syndrome scales (eg, anxious/depressed). we quantified wm with diffusion tensor imaging (dti), globally and at a tract level. we used cross-lagged panel models to test bidirectional associations of global and specific measures of psychopathology and wm microstructure, meta-analyzed results across cohorts, and used linear mixed-effects models for validation. results: we did not identify any longitudinal associations of global wm microstructure with internalizing or externalizing problems across cohorts (confirmatory analyses) before, and after multiple testing corrections. we observed similar findings for longitudinal associations between tract-based microstructure with internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and for global wm microstructure with specific syndromes (exploratory analyses). some cross-sectional associations surpassed multiple testing corrections in abcd, but not in genr.conclusion: uni-or bi-directionality of longitudinal associations between wm and psychiatric symptoms were not robustly identified. we have proposed several explanations for these findings, including interindividual differences, the use of longitudinal approaches, and smaller effects than expected.study registration information: bidirectionality brain function and psychiatric symptoms; https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/pny92",AB_0543
"background: chronic pelvic sepsis mostly originates from complicated pelvic surgery and failed interventions. this is a challenging condition that often requires extensive salvage surgery consisting of complete debridement with source control and filling of the dead space with well-vascularized tissue. objective: this study aimed to describe the outcomes of gluteal fasciocutaneous flaps for the treatment of secondary pelvic sepsis. design: retrospective single-center cohort study. settings: tertiary referral center. patients: patients who underwent salvage surgery for secondary pelvic sepsis between 2012 and 2020 using a gluteal flap were included in this study. main outcome measures: percentage of complete wound healing. results: in total, 27 patients were included, of whom 22 underwent index rectal resection for cancer and 21 had undergone (chemo)radiotherapy. a median of 3 (interquartile range, 15) surgical and 1 (interquartile range, 14) radiological interventions preceded salvage surgery during a median period of 62 (interquartile range, 20124) months. salvage surgery included partial sacrectomy in 20 patients. the gluteal flap consisted of a v-y flap in 16 patients, superior gluteal artery perforator flap in 8 patients, and a gluteal turnover flap in 3 patients. median hospital stay was 9 (interquartile range, 618) days. during a median follow-up of 18 (interquartile range, 634) months, wound complications occurred in 41%, with a reintervention rate of 30%. the median time to wound healing was 69 (interquartile range, 33154) days, with a complete healing rate of 89% at the end of follow-up. limitations: retrospective design and heterogeneous patient population. conclusions: in patients undergoing major salvage surgery for chronic pelvic sepsis, the use of gluteal fasciocutaneous flaps is a promising solution because of the high success rate, limited risks, and relatively simple technique. see video abstract at https://links.lww.com/dcr/c160.",AB_0543
