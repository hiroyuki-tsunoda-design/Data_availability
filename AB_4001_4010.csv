"background: enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) is an important cause of moderate to severe diarrhoea in children for which there is no licensed vaccine. we evaluated etvax (r), an oral, inactivated etec vaccine containing four e. coli strains over-expressing the major colonization factors cfa/i, cs3, cs5, and cs6, a toxoid (lctba) and double mutant heat-labile enterotoxin (dmlt) adjuvant for safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity.methods: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, age-descending, dose-finding trial was undertaken in 40 adults, 60 children aged 10-23 months, and 146 aged 6-9 months. adults received one full dose of etvax (r) and children received 3 doses of either 1/4 or 1/8 dose. safety was evaluated as solicited and unsolicited events for 7 days following vaccination. immunogenicity was assessed by evaluation of plasma iga antibody responses to cfa/i, cs3, cs5, cs6, and ltb, and igg responses to ltb.results: solicited adverse events were mostly mild or moderate with only 2 severe fever reports which were unrelated to the vaccine. the most common events were abdominal pain in adults (26.7 % in vaccinees vs 20 % in placebos), and fever in children aged 6-9 months (44 % vs 54 %). dosage, number of vaccinations and decreasing age had no influence on severity or frequency of adverse events. the vaccine induced plasma iga and igg responses against ltb in 100 % of the adults and 80-90 % of the children. in the 6-23 months cohort, iga responses to more than 3 vaccine antigens after 3 doses determined as >= 2-fold rise was significantly higher for 1/4 dose compared to placebo (56.7 % vs 27.2 %, p = 0.01). in the 6-9 months cohort, responses to the 1/4 dose were significantly higher than 1/8 dose after 3 rather than 2 doses.conclusion: etvax (r) was safe, tolerable, and immunogenic in zambian adults and children. the 1/4 dose induced significantly stronger iga responses and is recommended for evaluation of protection in children.clinical trials registration: the trial is registered with the pan african clinical trials registry (pactr ref. 201905764389804) and a description of this clinical trial is available on: https://pactr.samrc.ac.za/trial design.",AB_0401
"the sbilib python library provides an integrated platform for the analysis of macromolecular structures and interactions. it combines simple 3d file parsing and workup methods with more advanced analytical tools. sbilib includes modules for macromolecular interactions, loops, super-secondary structures, and biological sequences, as well as wrappers for external tools with which to integrate their results and facilitate the comparative analysis of protein structures and their complexes. the library can handle macromolecular complexes formed by proteins and/or nucleic acid molecules (i.e. dna and rna). it is uniquely capable of parsing and calculating protein super-secondary structure and loop geometry. we have compiled a list of example scenarios which sbilib may be applied to and provided access to these within the library. availability and implementation: sbilib is made available on github at https://github.com/structuralbioinformatics/sbilib.",AB_0401
"we introduce the unified cluster catalogue, the largest catalogue of stellar clusters currently listing nearly 14 000 objects. in this initial release, it exclusively contains milky way open clusters, with plans to include other objects in future updates. each cluster is processed using a novel probability membership algorithm, which incorporates the coordinates, parallax, proper motions, and their associated uncertainties for each star into the probability assignment process. we employ gaia data release 3 (dr3) up to a g magnitude of 20, resulting in the identification of over a million probable members. the catalogue is accompanied by a publicly accessible website designed to simplify the search and data exploration of stellar clusters. the website can be accessed at https://ucc.ar.",AB_0401
"post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) is a chronic and debilitating mental condition that is developed in response to catastrophic life events, such as military combat, sexual assault, and natural disasters. ptsd is characterized by flashbacks of past traumatic events, intrusive thoughts, nightmares, hypervigilance, and sleep disturbance, all of which affect a person's life and lead to considerable social, occupational, and interpersonal dysfunction. the diagnosis of ptsd is done by medical professionals using self-assessment questionnaire of ptsd symptoms as defined in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm). in this paper, and for the first time, we collected, annotated, and prepared for public distribution a new video database for automatic ptsd diagnosis, called ptsd-in-the-wild dataset. the database exhibits natural and big variability in acquisition conditions with different pose, facial expression, lighting, focus, resolution, age, gender, race, occlusions and background. in addition to describing the details of the dataset collection, we provide a benchmark for evaluating machine learning-based approaches on ptsd-in-the-wild dataset. in addition, we propose and we evaluate a deep learning-based approach for ptsd detection in respect to the given benchmark. the proposed approach shows very promising results. interested researcher can download a copy of ptsd-in-the wild dataset from http://www.lissi.fr/ptsd-dataset/.",AB_0401
"motivation spatial domain identification is a very important problem in the field of spatial transcriptomics. the state-of-the-art solutions to this problem focus on unsupervised methods, as there is lack of data for a supervised learning formulation. the results obtained from these methods highlight significant opportunities for improvement.results in this article, we propose a potential avenue for enhancement through the development of a semi-supervised convolutional neural network based approach. named scribbledom, our method leverages human expert's input as a form of semi-supervision, thereby seamlessly combines the cognitive abilities of human experts with the computational power of machines. scribbledom incorporates a loss function that integrates two crucial components: similarity in gene expression profiles and adherence to the valuable input of a human annotator through scribbles on histology images, providing prior knowledge about spot labels. the spatial continuity of the tissue domains is taken into account by extracting information on the spot microenvironment through convolution filters of varying sizes, in the form of inception blocks. by leveraging this semi-supervised approach, scribbledom significantly improves the quality of spatial domains, yielding superior results both quantitatively and qualitatively. our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the clear edge of scribbledom over state-of-the-art methods-between 1.82% to 169.38% improvements in adjusted rand index for 9 of the 12 human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples, and 15.54% improvement in the melanoma cancer dataset. notably, when the expert input is absent, scribbledom can still operate, in a fully unsupervised manner like the state-of-the-art methods, and produces results that remain competitive.availability and implementation source code is available at github (https://github.com/1alnoman/scribbledom) and zenodo (https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/681572669).",AB_0401
"this study attempts to synthesize a realistic-looking fundus image from a morphologically changed vessel structure using the newly proposed sharpening and varying vessels technique (svv). this technique sharpens the reconstructed vessels and introduces variation to their structure to generate multiple images from a single input mask. this helps to reduce the reliance on expensive and scarce annotated medical data. the study also aims to overcome the limitations of current methods, such as unrealistic optic disc boundaries, extreme vessel tortuosity, and missed optic discs. this is mainly due to the fact that existing models penalize their weights based on the difference between real and synthetic images using only a single mask. therefore, their emphasis is on generating the input mask while disregarding other important fundoscopic features. inspired by the recent progress in generative adversarial nets (gans) and variational autoencoder (vae), the proposed approach was able to preserve the geometrical shape of critical fundus characteristics. visual and quantitative results indicate that the produced images are considerably distinct from the ones used for training. however, they also exhibit anatomical coherence and a reasonable level of visual. the data utilized in this study and the programming code necessary to recreate the experiment can be accessed at https://github.com/alisaeed86/svv_gan.",AB_0401
"identification of plasmids from sequencing data is an important and challenging problem related to antimicrobial resistance spread and other one-health issues. we provide a new architecture for identifying plasmid contigs in fragmented genome assemblies built from short-read data. we employ graph neural networks (gnns) and the assembly graph to propagate the information from nearby nodes, which leads to more accurate classification, especially for short contigs that are difficult to classify based on sequence features or database searches alone. we trained plasgraph2 on a data set of samples from the eskapee group of pathogens. plasgraph2 either outperforms or performs on par with a wide range of state-of-the-art methods on testing sets of independent eskapee samples and samples from related pathogens. on one hand, our study provides a new accurate and easy to use tool for contig classification in bacterial isolates; on the other hand, it serves as a proof-of-concept for the use of gnns in genomics. our software is available at https://github.com/cchauve/plasgraph2 and the training and testing data sets are available at https://github.com/fmfi-compbio/plasgraph2-datasets.",AB_0401
"ongoing and future climate change driven expansion of aeroallergen-producing plant species comprise a major human health problem across europe and elsewhere. there is an urgent need to produce accurate, temporally dynamic maps at the continental level, especially in the context of climate uncertainty. this study aimed to restore missing daily ragweed pollen data sets for europe, to produce phenological maps of ragweed pollen, resulting in the most complete and detailed high-resolution ragweed pollen concentration maps to date. to achieve this, we have developed two statistical procedures, a gaussian method (gm) and deep learning (dl) for restoring missing daily ragweed pollen data sets, based on the plant's reproductive and growth (phenological, pollen production and frost-related) characteristics. dl model performances were consistently better for estimating seasonal pollen integrals than those of the gm approach. these are the first published modelled maps using altitude correction and flowering phenology to recover missing pollen information. we created a web page (http://euragweedpollen.gmf.u-szeged.hu/), including daily ragweed pollen concentration data sets of the stations examined and their restored daily data, allowing one to upload newly measured or recovered daily data. generation of these maps provides a means to track pollen impacts in the context of climatic shifts, identify geographical regions with high pollen exposure, determine areas of future vulnerability, apply spatially-explicit mitigation measures and prioritize management interventions.",AB_0401
"introductionwe will launch a national survey in serbia to document the prevalence of two types of questionable health behaviours: (1) intentional non-adherence to medical recommendations and (2) use of traditional, complementary and alternative medicine practices, as well as the relation between the two. we will also investigate their psychological roots, including (a) 'distal' predictors such as hexaco personality traits (plus disintegration) and thinking dispositions (rational/experiential thinking and cognitive reflexivity), and (b) 'proximal' predictors under the umbrella 'irrational mindset' (set of unfounded beliefs consisting of conspiratorial thinking, superstition, magical health beliefs as well as selected cognitive biases), which have more content-wise overlap with the health behaviours.methods and analysisin this cross-sectional study, a research agency will collect data from a nationally representative sample (n=1043; age 18-75 years; estimated start/end-june/november 2021) recruited online (approximately, 70% of the sample, aged 18-54; 11 years) and face-to-face (approximately, 30% of the sample, aged 55-75 years). participants will complete a battery of tests assessing questionable health behaviours, basic personality traits, thinking dispositions, irrational mindset, sociopolitical beliefs, sociodemographic and health-related variables. prevalence rates will be calculated using descriptive statistics. to explore the relation between (psychological) predictors and questionable health behaviours, we will use hierarchical regression and partial mediation models (path analysis or full sem models).ethics and disseminationethical committees of the faculty of philosophy in belgrade (#935/1), faculty of special education and rehabilitation (#139/1) and faculty of media and communications (#228) approved the protocol. only participants who provide informed consent will participate in the study. a research report based on the study results will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals and results will be made available to stakeholders through reports on the project website https://reasonforhealth.f.bg.ac.rs/en/ and disseminated via social media.trial registration numbernct05808660",AB_0401
"in the last century, an increasing number of extreme weather events have been experienced across the globe. these events have also been linked to changes in water quality, especially due to heavy rains, flooding, or droughts. in terms of blue economic activities, harmful algal bloom events can pose a major threat, especially when they become widespread and last for several days. we present and discuss advanced measurements of a bloom dominated by the cyanobacterium nodularia spumigena conducted by hyperspectral optical technologies via experiments of opportunity. absorption coefficients, absorbance and fluorescence were measured in the laboratory, and these data are available at 10.4121/21610995.v1 (wollschlager et al., 2022), 10.4121/21822051.v1 (miranda et al., 2023) and 10.4121/21904632.v1 (miranda and garaba, 2023). data used to derive the above-water reflectance are available from 10.4121/21814977.v1 (garaba, 2023) and 10.4121/21814773.v1 (garaba and albinus, 2023). additionally, hyperspectral fluorescence measurements of the dissolved compounds in the water were carried out. these hyperspectral measurements were conducted over a wide spectrum (200-2500 nm). diagnostic optical features were determined using robust statistical techniques. water clarity was inferred from secchi disc measurements (10.1594/pangaea.951239, garaba and albinus, 2022). identification of the cyanobacterium was completed via visual analysis under a microscope. full sequences of the 16s rrna and rbcl genes were obtained, revealing a very strong match to n. spumigena; these data are available via genbank: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/op918142/ (garaba and bonthond, 2022b) and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/op925098 (garaba and bonthond, 2022a). the chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin levels determined are available from 10.4121/21792665.v1 (rohde et al., 2023). our experiments of opportunity echo the importance of sustainable, simplified, coordinated and continuous water quality monitoring as a way to thrive with respect to the targets set in the united nations sustainable development goals (e.g. 6, 11, 12 and 14) or the european union framework directives (e.g. the water framework directive and marine strategy framework directive).",AB_0401
