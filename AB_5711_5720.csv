"adverse pregnancy outcomes (apos) are major risk factors for women's health during pregnancy and even in the years after pregnancy. due to the heterogeneity of apos, only few genetic associations have been identified. in this report, we conducted genome-wide association studies (gwass) of 479 traits that are possibly related to apos using a large and racially diverse study, nulliparous pregnancy outcomes study: monitoring mothers-to-be (numom2b). to display extensive results, we developed a web-based tool gnumom2b (https://gnumom2b.cumcobgyn.org/) for searching, visualizing, and sharing results from a gwas of 479 pregnancy traits as well as phenome-wide association studies of more than 17 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. the genetic results from 3 ancestries (europeans, africans, and admixed americans) and meta-analyses are populated in gnumom2b. in conclusion, gnumom2b is a valuable resource for extraction of pregnancy-related genetic results and shows the potential to facilitate meaningful discoveries.",AB_0572
"background: advanced endoscopy can be used for the complete removal of large colorectal polyps. to date, few surgeons perform advanced endoscopy, and it is unknown how many procedures are needed to reach proficiency. objective: this study aimed to determine the learning curve for colorectal advanced endoscopy. design: retrospective. setting: tertiary referral center. patients: we queried a prospectively maintained institutional database of advanced endoscopy performed by a high-volume colorectal surgeon between 2011 and 2018. main outcome measures: advanced endoscopy characteristics were compared for 6 chronological intervals. primary end points were the rates of complications and polyp recurrence. secondary end point was the change in polyp removal rate (mm/h) over time. results: a total of 207 patients underwent advanced endoscopy for a single colorectal polyp. the median polyp size was 30 (4-70) mm, 61.5% were located in the right colon, and 8.8% were malignant. the mean procedure time was 77 (range, 16-320) minutes. immediate colon resection occurred in 25 patients because of suspicion of cancer or concern for perforation and was excluded from the learning curve analysis. the remaining 182 advanced endoscopy procedures were divided into intervals of 30 procedures. the median removal rate was highest in the last interval and in the endoscopy suite. a removal rate of 30 mm/h was achieved after performing 100 cases. the complication rate (bleeding or return to operating room) was 12.1% and was similar across intervals. the readmission rate was 11.5%, and 6.6% of 6-month follow-up colonoscopies showed polyp recurrence at the resection site. limitations: retrospective design and single surgeon. conclusion: the learning curve for achieving proficiency with advanced endoscopy in the colon and rectum required a minimum of 100 cases with a low complication rate, low polyp recurrence rate, high en bloc resection rate, and a polyp removal rate of 30 mm/h. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c162.",AB_0572
"background: mesenchymal stem cells have been used for the treatment of perianal crohn's fistulizing disease by direct injection. however, no studies to date have included patients with proctitis, anal canal involvement, and multiple branching tracts. objective: this study aimed to determine safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells for refractory perianal crohn's disease. design: phase ib/iia randomized controlled trial. settings: tertiary ibd referral center. patients: adult crohn's disease patients with perianal fistulizing disease. intervention: seventy-five million mesenchymal stem cells were administered with a 22-g needle by direct injection after curettage and primary closure of the fistula tract. a repeat injection of 75 million mesenchymal stem cells at 3 months was given if complete clinical and radiographic healing were not achieved. main outcomes measures: adverse and serious adverse events occurred at postprocedure day 1, week 2, week 6, month 3, month 6, and month 12. clinical healing, radiographic healing per mri, and patientreported outcomes were collected at the same time points. results: a total of 23 patients were enrolled and treated; 18 were treatment patients and 5 were control. there were no adverse or serious adverse events reported related to mesenchymal stem cell therapy. at 6 months, 83% of the treatment group and 40% of the control group had complete clinical and radiographic healing. the perianal crohn's disease activity index, wexner incontinence score, and vanassche score had all significantly decreased in treatment patients at 6 months; none significantly decreased in the control group. limitations: single institution and single blinded. conclusions: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells offer a safe and effective alternative treatment approach for severe perianal fistulizing crohn's disease. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c128.",AB_0572
"background: currently, patients with a limited extent of peritoneal metastases from colon and rectal cancer are treated by cytoreductive surgery combined with perioperative chemotherapy performed at experienced centers. objective: to statistically evaluate features that may impact survival of >= 5 years. these data are used in the risk/benefit analyses performed by the multidisciplinary team. design: this was a retrospective review of a prospective database. settings: this single-institution study was conducted at an academic center. patients: all patients who had biopsy-proven colon or rectal peritoneal metastases treated by systemic chemotherapy, complete cytoreductive surgery, and perioperative surgery were included. main outcome measures: the primary outcomes measured were the clinical-, histologic-, and treatment-related features that had an impact on 5-year survival. results: from 131 patients who had complete cytoreduction, 35 patients (26.7%) were identified as 5-year survivors. the median survival time was 27 months. the median age was 50.5 (range, 25-80) years. by univariant analysis, an absence of lymph node involvement at the time of primary colorectal cancer resection (hr 1.899 [95% ci, 1.064-3.388]; p = 0.03), complete or near-complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (hr 0.251 [95% ci, 0.092-0.684]; p = 0.007), peritoneal cancer index <= 17 (hr 0.509 [95% ci, 0.329-0.788]; p = 0.002), complete visible resection of disease indicated by the completeness of cytoreduction score of 0 (hr 0.412 [95% ci, 0.224-0.756]; p = 0.004), and well-differentiated tumor (hr 0.34 [95% ci, 0.157-0.737]; p = 0.006) were significantly associated with >= 5 years survival. limitations: limitations include its retrospective nature, unmeasured confounders, and data from a single institution. conclusions: the tumor biology as revealed by lymph node status and tumor differentiation plus extent of disease as measured by the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, peritoneal cancer index, and no visible residual disease indicated a favorable outcome. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c62.",AB_0572
"uncovering rationales behind predictions of graph neural networks (gnns) has received increasing attention over recent years. instance-level gnn explanation aims to discover critical input elements, such as nodes or edges, that the target gnn relies upon for making predictions. though various algorithms are proposed, most of them formalize this task by searching the minimal subgraph, which can preserve original predictions. however, an inductive bias is deep-rooted in this framework: several subgraphs can result in the same or similar outputs as the original graphs. consequently, they have the danger of providing spurious explanations and failing to provide consistent explanations. applying them to explain weakly performed gnns would further amplify these issues. to address this problem, we theoretically examine the predictions of gnns from the causality perspective. two typical reasons for spurious explanations are identified: confounding effect of latent variables like distribution shift and causal factors distinct from the original input. observing that both confounding effects and diverse causal rationales are encoded in internal representations, we propose a new explanation framework with an auxiliary alignment loss, which is theoretically proven to be optimizing a more faithful explanation objective intrinsically. concretely for this alignment loss, a set of different perspectives are explored: anchor-based alignment, distributional alignment based on gaussian mixture models, mutual-information-based alignment, and so on. a comprehensive study is conducted both on the effectiveness of this new framework in terms of explanation faithfulness/consistency and on the advantages of these variants. for our codes, please refer to the following url link: https://github.com/tianxiangzhao/graphnnexplanation",AB_0572
"background: living in neighborhoods with higher levels of walkability has been associated with a reduced risk of obesity and higher levels of phys-ical activity. obesity has been linked to increased risk of 13 cancers in women. however, long-term prospective studies of neighborhood walkability and risk for obesity-related cancer are scarce. objectives: we evaluated the association between long-term average neighborhood walkability and obesity-related cancer risk in women. methods: the new york university women's health study (nyuwhs) is a prospective cohort with 14,274 women recruited between 1985 and 1991 in new york city and followed over nearly three decades. we geocoded residential addresses for each participant throughout follow-up and cal-culated an average annual measure of neighborhood walkability across years of follow-up using data on population density and accessibility to desti-nations associated with geocoded residential addresses. we used icd-9 codes to characterize first primary obesity-related cancers and employed cox proportional hazards models to assess the association between average neighborhood walkability and risk of overall and site-specific obesity-related cancers. results: residing in neighborhoods with a higher walkability level was associated with a reduced risk of overall and site-specific obesity-related cancers. the hazards ratios associated with a 1-standard deviation increase in average annual neighborhood walkability were 0.88 (95% ci: 0.85, 0.93) for overall obesity-related cancer, 0.89 (95% ci: 0.84, 0.95) for postmenopausal breast cancer, 0.82 (95% ci: 0.68, 0.99) for ovarian cancer, 0.87 (95% ci: 0.76, 0.99) for endometrial cancer, and 0.68 (95% ci: 0.49, 0.94) for multiple myeloma, adjusting for potential confounders at both the individual and neighborhood level. the association between neighborhood walkability and risk of overall obesity-related cancer was stronger among women living in neighborhoods with higher levels of poverty compared with women living in areas with lower poverty levels (pinteraction = 0:006). discussion: our study highlights a potential protective role of neighborhood walkability in preventing obesity-related cancers in women. https://doi. org/10.1289/ehp11538",AB_0572
"background and purpose:more than 50% of individuals with spinal cord injury (sci) report no regular exercise due to numerous barriers to participation. tele-exercise services offer viable solutions to reduce barriers. however, limited evidence for sci-specific tele-exercise programs is available. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a synchronous group tele-exercise program designed for individuals with sci.methods:explanatory sequential mixed-methods design assessed feasibility of a synchronous 2-month biweekly group tele-exercise program for individuals with sci. numeric measures of feasibility were first collected (recruitment rate, sample features, retention, attendance), followed by postprogram interviews with participants. thematic analysis of experiential feedback elaborated on numeric findings.results:eleven volunteers (ages = 49.5 & plusmn; 16.7 years) with sci (range: 2.7-33.0 years) enrolled within 2 weeks of recruitment initiation. retention was 100% retention at program completion. median number of live classes attended per participant was 10 (62.5%). participants described that attendance and satisfaction were facilitated by program-specific features including coinstruction by instructors with sci-specific knowledge and lived experience, as well as group structure. participants reported increased exercise knowledge, confidence, and motivation.discussion and conclusions:this study demonstrated feasibility of a synchronous group tele-exercise class for individuals with sci. key features facilitating participation include class length, frequency, coleadership by individuals familiar with sci and exercise instruction, and group motivation. these findings begin to examine a viable tele-service strategy that could be employed as a bridge among rehabilitation specialists, community fitness instructors, and clients with sci to increase physical activity access and behavior.video abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the video, supplemental digital content 1 available at: http://links.lww.com/jnpt/a442).discussion and conclusions:this study demonstrated feasibility of a synchronous group tele-exercise class for individuals with sci. key features facilitating participation include class length, frequency, coleadership by individuals familiar with sci and exercise instruction, and group motivation. these findings begin to examine a viable tele-service strategy that could be employed as a bridge among rehabilitation specialists, community fitness instructors, and clients with sci to increase physical activity access and behavior.video abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the video, supplemental digital content 1 available at: http://links.lww.com/jnpt/a442).",AB_0572
"background and purpose:there is interest in incorporating digital health technology in routine practice. we integrate multiple stakeholder perspectives to describe implementation determinants (barriers and facilitators) regarding digital health technology use to facilitate exercise behavior change for people with parkinson disease in outpatient physical therapy.methods:the purposeful sample included people with parkinson disease (n = 13), outpatient physical therapists (n = 12), and advanced technology stakeholders including researchers and reimbursement specialists (n = 13). semistructured interviews were used to elicit implementation determinants related to using digital health technology for activity monitoring and exercise behavior change. deductive codes based on the consolidated framework for implementation research were used to describe implementation determinants.results:key implementation determinants were similar across stakeholder groups. essential characteristics of digital health technology included design quality and packaging, adaptability, complexity, and cost. implementation of digital health technology by physical therapists and people with parkinson disease was influenced by their knowledge, attitudes, and varied confidence levels in using digital health technology. inner setting organizational determinants included available resources and access to knowledge/information. process determinants included device interoperability with medical record systems and workflow integration. outer setting barriers included lack of external policies, regulations, and collaboration with device companies.discussion and conclusions:future implementation interventions should address key determinants, including required processes for how and when physical therapists instruct people with parkinson disease on digital health technology, organizational readiness, workflow integration, and characteristics of physical therapists and people with parkinson disease who may have ingrained beliefs regarding their ability and willingness to use digital health technology. although site-specific barriers should be addressed, digital health technology knowledge translation tools tailored to individuals with varied confidence levels may be generalizable across clinics.video abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the video, supplemental digital content available at: http://links.lww.com/jnpt/a436).discussion and conclusions:future implementation interventions should address key determinants, including required processes for how and when physical therapists instruct people with parkinson disease on digital health technology, organizational readiness, workflow integration, and characteristics of physical therapists and people with parkinson disease who may have ingrained beliefs regarding their ability and willingness to use digital health technology. although site-specific barriers should be addressed, digital health technology knowledge translation tools tailored to individuals with varied confidence levels may be generalizable across clinics.video abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the video, supplemental digital content available at: http://links.lww.com/jnpt/a436).",AB_0572
