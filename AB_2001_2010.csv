"scattering particles (such as water vapor and dust) in the atmosphere excessively absorb and scatter light, which causes the image collected by imaging sensors with low visibility, low contrast, color shifting, etc. this limitation hinders the development of vision-driven artificial intelligence applications, such as the intelligent traffic monitoring system (itms). to improve the imaging quality in hazy and sandstorm conditions, this article proposes a novel two-in-one low-visibility enhancement network (termed toenet). specifically, we take into account the changes in the histogram distributions of the red, green, and blue channels of the hazy and sandstorm images and present a multilayer perceptron (mlp)-based channel correlation extraction module (ccem) to learn and reconstruct the correlation between the channels of low-visibility images. the multiscale channel attention features generated by ccem will be embedded into the backbone (i.e., the encoder-decoder network) of toenet to extract additional latent feature information from low-visibility images. toenet can achieve both dehazing and sandstorm enhancement through a single deep network model without incurring extra computational costs. extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed toenet outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets. furthermore, the running time and object detection experiments indicate the practical benefits of our method for high-level visual task under low-visibility weathers in itms. the source code is available at https://github.com/yuangao-yg/toenet.",AB_0201
"this work aims to improve the low accuracy caused by interference information during real-time weld surface detection. first, a weld surface dataset with 7580 pictures containing eight types of defects was established. second, an improved detection model named yolo-msapf was designed based on yolo-v5 model and verified by the self-established database. finally, a real-time detection system was built to analyze the performance of the detection model in an industrial environment. the design principle of the yolo-msapf is to eliminate interference information but enhance necessary features in each scale as much as possible by multiscale alignment fusion (msaf) with parallel features filtering (pff) modules (i.e., msapf strategy). for the msaf, not only the accuracy but the richness of fused features is guaranteed by aligning features at one level to fuse all other scales. after that, the fused features in each scale were individually filtered out in parallel spatial and channel in the pff module. the results show that rate for the images with missing detection for eight types of defects sharply drops from 21.47% to 1.68% when the msapf strategy is used. moreover, it is worth noting that the map@0.5 of the yolo-msapf model reaches 95.3%, which is similar to the yolo-v7 model, while the number of parameters is reduced by 30.1%, compared with the baseline model. additionally, the great ability to screen out unqualified weld is also verified in the industrial environment. soon, code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/luckycat518/yolo-msapf.",AB_0201
"sea-land segmentation of optical remote-sensing images holds great importance for military and civilian applications, such as coastal monitoring, target detection, and resource management. although convolutional neural networks (cnns) have achieved significant improvements in semantic segmentation, the challenges of efficient feature extraction, representation, fusion, and information transmission remain unsolved, which especially impacts the segmentation effectiveness of existing cnn-based models in extracting irregular and refined sea-land boundaries. in this article, a novel dual-branch ensemble network (dbenet) is proposed for pixel-level sea-land segmentation. the salient properties of the dbenet are: 1) a novel dual-branch network architecture is developed to achieve sufficient feature extraction and representation and 2) an efficient ensemble attention learning strategy suitable for the dbenet is designed to strengthen the correlation between dual branches to further facilitate feature fusion and information transmission. the comparative study with state-of-the-art methods reveals the superior performance of our approach, and the ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of each component in the proposed network. the source code is available at https://github.com/roberttang0/dbenet.",AB_0201
"pavement defects such as cracks, net cracks, and pit slots can cause potential traffic safety problems. the timely detection and identification play a key role in reducing the harm of various pavement defects. particularly, the recent development in deep learning (dl)-based convolution neural networks (cnns) has shown competitive performance in image detection and classification. to detect pavement defects automatically and improve effects, a multiscale mobile attention-based network, which we termed manet, is proposed to perform the detection of pavement defects. the architecture of the encoder-decoder is used in manet, where the encoder adopts the mobilenet as the backbone network to extract pavement defect features. instead of the original 3 x 3 convolution, the multiscale convolution kernels are used in depthwise separable convolution (dsconv) layers of the network. furthermore, the hybrid attention mechanism is separately incorporated into the encoder and decoder modules to infer the significance of spatial points and interchannel relationship features for the input intermediate feature maps. the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two publicly available benchmark datasets, i.e., the crack500 (500 crack images with 2000 x 1500 pixels) and cfd (118 crack images with 480 x 320 pixels) datasets. the mean intersection over union (miou) of the proposed approach on these two datasets reaches 0.7219 and 0.7788, respectively. ablation experiments show that the multiscale convolution and hybrid attention modules can effectively help the model extract high-level feature representations and generate more accurate pavement crack segmentation results. we further test the model on locally collected pavement crack images (131 images with 1024 x 768 pixels) and it achieves a satisfactory result. the proposed approach realizes the miou of 0.6514 on the local dataset and outperforms other compared baseline methods. experimental findings demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed approach and it provides a viable solution for pavement crack detection in practical application scenarios. our code is available at https://github.com/xtu502/pavement-defects.",AB_0201
"video-based hand gesture authentication is a challenging fine-grained spatiotemporal analysis task, which requires models with the ability to extract stable physiological and behavioral features from dynamic gestures. inspired by biological studies, we present a physiological-behavioral characteristic understanding network (pb-net) for hand gesture authentication. according to the properties of physiological and behavioral characteristics, we design two branches, the physiological branch (p-branch) and the behavioral branch (b-branch), as well as corresponding data-tailoring strategies for the pb-net. the data-tailoring strategies can produce two customized videos for the two branches, which can facilitate the analyses of physiological and behavioral characteristics. besides, the data-tailoring strategies can remove significant redundant information and thus can improve running efficiency. the p-branch and b-branch do not interfere with each other and focus on the distillation of physiological and behavioral features separately. considering that the important degree of the physiological and behavioral features could be different and changeable, we devise an adaptive physiological-behavioral feature fusion (apbf) module to automatically assign appropriate weights for the two features and merge them together to obtain a more satisfactory identity feature. finally, the rationality, validity, and superiority of the pb-net are fully demonstrated by extensive ablation experiments and sufficient comparisons with 23 excellent video understanding networks on the scut-dhga dataset. the code is available at https://github.com/scut-bip-lab/pb-net.",AB_0201
"background: preterm premature rupture of membranes (pprom) is closely associated with pathogenic microbiomes in the female reproductive tract, and can lead to neonatal septicemia. the current study aimed to investigate potential pathogenic microbiomes associated with neonatal septicemia based on dna metagenome sequencing. methods: in this study, a total of 7 pregnant women with pprom presenting neonatal septicemia (experimental group) and 3 pregnant women with normal newborns (control group) were enrolled. vaginal secretions at admission and before parturition as well as placental tissues after parturition were collected for dna metagenome sequencing using whole genome shotgun method on the illumina novaseq/hiseq platform. raw data were processed by biobakery workflow, and metaphlan4 was implemented for qualitative and quantitative analyses of microbiome. lactobacillus crispatus, gardneralla vaginalis, fannyhessea vaginae and streptococcus suis were specifically detected from the experimental group. the two groups were compared using student's t-tests. results: the indexes of chao1 (p=0.00028/p=0.00072), abundance-based coverage estimator (ace, p=0.00059/p=0.00026), shannon (p=0.036/p=0.0065) and simpson (p=0.007/p=0.041) in the experimental group were increased at admission and before parturition as compared with the control group. several microbiomes, such as lactobacillus crispatus, gardneralla vaginalis, fannyhessea vaginae and streptococcus suis, were specifically detected in the experimental group. notably, gardnerella vaginalis and streptococcus gallolyticus were identified from the vaginal secretions and placenta tissues of women with neonatal septicemia. moreover, nucleic acid synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism-related pathways were enriched in the experimental group. conclusion: this study enhanced the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying pathogenic microbiomes in pprom-induced neonatal septicemia. the trial registry number is chictr2300070666 (url: https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=195648).",AB_0201
"deep learning methods have been widely explored in motor imagery (mi)-based brain computer interface (bci) systems to decode electroencephalography (eeg) signals. however, most studies fail to fully explore temporal dependencies among mi-related patterns generated in different stages during mi tasks, resulting in limited mi-eeg decoding performance. apart from feature extraction, learning temporal dependencies is equally important to develop a subject-specific mi-based bci because every subject has their own way of performing mi tasks. in this paper, a novel temporal dependency learning convolutional neural network (cnn) with attention mechanism is proposed to address mi-eeg decoding. the network first learns spatial and spectral information from multi-view eeg data via the spatial convolution block. then, a series of non-overlapped time windows is employed to segment the output data, and the discriminative feature is further extracted from each time window to capture mi-related patterns generated in different stages. furthermore, to explore temporal dependencies among discriminative features in different time windows, we design a temporal attention module that assigns different weights to features in various time windows and fuses them into more discriminative features. the experimental results on the bci competition iv-2a (bcic-iv-2a) and openbmi datasets show that our proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and achieves the average accuracy of 79.48%, improved by 2.30% on the bcic-iv-2a dataset. we demonstrate that learning temporal dependencies effectively improves mi-eeg decoding performance. the code is available at https://github.com/ma-xinzhi/lightconvnet",AB_0201
"automated surface defect detection for products attracts lots of interest in the industry, which is typically an image classification task. although convolutional neural networks (cnns) with shift and scale invariance have become the de-facto standard for such task in computer vision, their applications to millimeter-level tiny defects with random orientation on the dark surface with the complex texture of magnetic tile remain limited. in this article, we propose, for the first time, introducing rotation invariance (ri) into convolution by rotating feature maps, thus enabling cnns to actively detect defects from multiple directions and decreasing the probability of missing tiny defects. next, we establish a lightweight neural architecture, i.e., cnn with ri (ricnn), with a model size of only 0.119 m. a developed image collection system can obtain real-time images on magnetic tile surface. additionally, we train and evaluate the model performance on a built mtsd3c6k dataset and a publicly available iacas3c6k dataset. experimental results on both datasets show that the proposed ricnn obtains superior classification performance compared with the state-of-the-art networks while requiring substantially fewer computational costs. the source code is available at https://github.com/clarkxielf/convolution-with-rotation-invariance-for-online-detection-of-tiny-defects-on-magnetic-tile-surface.",AB_0201
"recognizing classroom behavior is crucial for assessing and improving teaching quality. however, the existing methods for behavior recognition have limited accuracy due to issues, such as occlusions, pose variations, and inconsistent target scales. to address these challenges, we propose an advanced single-stage object detector called convnext block prediction head network (cbph-net). specifically, we design an efficient feature extraction module (fem) to capture more channel information and relevant features from the images in the backbone network. the neck network combines the path aggregation network (panet) architecture and coordinate attention (ca) to integrate semantic and positional information and suppress irrelevant background information, enabling the network to accurately locate students. cbph utilizes convolutional kernels of different sizes and parsing multiscale features to enhance the multiscale recognition capability of cbph-net especially for accurate detection of small objects. to reduce the influence of irrelevant background, we use elliptical boxes instead of rectangular boxes when calculating the similarity between ground-truth and predicted values. in addition, we construct a dataset named student-teacher behavior dataset (stbd-08) that contains 4432 images with 151574 labeled anchors covering eight typical classroom behaviors. on the proposed dataset stbd-08, cbph-net achieves a mean average precision (map) of 87.5% (an improvement of 3.4% compared with yolov5 and 1.2% compared with yolov7). it processes one frame with the latency of 31.3 ms (1 ms slower than yolov5 and 5.3 ms faster than yolov7). moreover, it achieves a precision of 75.7% in small object recognition, surpassing all comparative methods. the experimental results demonstrate that the cbph-net can be efficiently applied to classroom behavior recognition tasks. codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/icedle/cbph-net.",AB_0201
"nowadays, light detection and ranging (lidar) sensors have been increasingly used in robotics, particularly in autonomous vehicles, for localization and mapping tasks. however, the use of lidar simultaneous localization and mapping (slam) in various scenarios is still limited. in this article, we propose a lidar slam system that addresses this issue by grouping consistent and stable geometry feature to better express the environmental properties in both odometry and loop closure detection. specifically, to achieve stable geometry feature extraction in the lidar odometry component, we adapt an adaptive feature extraction technique that extracts planar, linear, and point features. in addition, we cluster the extracted geometry features to filter out noise. we also analyze the geometry feature matching error and constraint consistency to ensure that the constraints built from these features are stable and repeatable. for the global optimization component, we construct a three-stage loop closure detection approach based on the distribution of geometry feature groups and their corresponding relationships. quantitative and qualitative experiments on the karlsruhe institute of technology and toyota technological institute (kitti) dataset, mulran dataset, and a dataset collected on university campus demonstrate the adaptability, accuracy, and repeatability of our method. in conclusion, our proposed lidar slam system improves the performance in complex and diverse scenarios by implementing stable geometry feature extraction, effective feature constraint classification, and accurate loop closure detection. the source code of our approach is available at https://github.com/qq1962572025/geometryslam.",AB_0201
