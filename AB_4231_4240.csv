"cranial implants are commonly used for surgical repair of craniectomy-induced skull defects. these implants are usually generated offline and may require days to weeks to be available. an automated implant design process combined with onsite manufacturing facilities can guarantee immediate implant availability and avoid secondary intervention. to address this need, the autoimplant ii challenge was organized in conjunction with miccai 2021, catering for the unmet clinical and computational requirements of automatic cranial implant design. the first edition of autoimplant (autoimplant i, 2020) demonstrated the general capabilities and effectiveness of data-driven approaches, including deep learning, for a skull shape completion task on synthetic defects. the second autoimplant challenge (i.e., autoimplant ii, 2021) built upon the first by adding real clinical craniectomy cases as well as additional synthetic imaging data. the autoimplant ii challenge consisted of three tracks. tracks 1 and 3 used skull images with synthetic defects to evaluate the ability of submitted approaches to generate implants that recreate the original skull shape. track 3 consisted of the data from the first challenge (i.e., 100 cases for training, and 110 for evaluation), and track 1 provided 570 training and 100 validation cases aimed at evaluating skull shape completion algorithms at diverse defect patterns. track 2 also made progress over the first challenge by providing 11 clinically defective skulls and evaluating the submitted implant designs on these clinical cases. the submitted designs were evaluated quantitatively against imaging data from post-craniectomy as well as by an experienced neurosurgeon. submissions to these challenge tasks made substantial progress in addressing issues such as generalizability, computational efficiency, data augmentation, and implant refinement. this paper serves as a comprehensive summary and comparison of the submissions to the autoimplant ii challenge. codes and models are available at https://github.com/jianningli/autoimplant_ii.",AB_0424
"in recent years, the computer vision and computer graphics communities have seen the emergence of new classes of models for representing objects based on neural radiance fields (nerfs). these techniques use ideas based on traditional methods from computer graphics, for example, radiance fields, and combine them with implicit neural representations and neural image-based rendering (ibr). however, one significant drawback of this class of techniques was that they were too slow, taking in the range of hours in high-end gpus. due to these limitations, new techniques have been created for the fast reconstruction of scenes, such as direct voxel grid optimization (directvoxgo). alongside this limitation, initially, nerfs had limited compositing and modeling capabilities. for example, a simple task such as separating the background from the foreground could not be modeled with nerfs until the emergence of new techniques such as nerf++. our method extends directvoxgo to allow the handling of unbounded scenes inspired by some ideas from nerf++ and also adapts it to incorporate elements from a neural hashing approach employed by other works. our technique improved photorealism compared with directvoxgo and plenoxels on a subset of the light field dataset on average in at least 2%, 8%, and 8% for peak signal-to-noise ratio (psnr), structural similarity index measure (ssim), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (lpips) metrics, respectively, while also being an order of magnitude faster than nerf++. also, we demonstrate that, for the evaluated scenes, our technique has comparable training time and memory consumption than previous works. code is available in https://github.com/danperazzo/dvgoplusplus.& copy; 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0424
"background: anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tdcs) over the primary motor cortex and cerebellum is gaining prominence in the literature due to its potential to favor learning and motor performance. if administered during motor training, tdcs is capable of increasing the effect of training. considering the motor impairment presented by children with autism spectrum disorders (asd), atdcs applied during motor training may contribute to the rehabilitation of these children. however, it is necessary to examine and compare the effects of atdcs over the motor cortex and the cerebellum on the motor skills of children with asd. this information may benefit future clinical indications of tdcs for rehabilitation of children with asd. the aim of the proposed study is to determine whether anodal tdcs over the primary motor cortex and cerebellum can enhance the effects of gait training and postural control on motor skills, mobility, functional balance, cortical excitability, cognitive aspects and behavioral aspects in children with asd. our hypothesis is the active tdcs combined with motor training will enhance the performance of the participants in comparison to sham tdcs. methods and design: a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind clinical trial will be conducted involving 30 children with asd that will be recruited to receive ten sessions of sham or ten sessions of active anodal tdcs (1ma, 20 min) over the primary motor cortex or cerebellun combined with motor training. the participants will be assessed before as well as one, four and eight weeks after the interventions. the primary outcome will be gross and fine motor skills. the secondary outcomes will be mobility, functional balance, motor cortical excitability, cognitive aspects and behavioral aspects. discussion: although abnormalities in gait and balance are not primary characteristics of asd, such abnormalities compromise independence and global functioning during the execution of routine activities of childhood. if demonstrated that anodal tdcs administered over areas of the brain involved in motor control, such as the primary motor cortex and cerebellum, can enhance the effects of gait and balance training in only ten sessions in two consecutive weeks, the clinical applicability of this stimulation modality will be expanded as well as more scientifically founded. clinical trial registration: february 16, 2023 (https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/rbr-3bskhwf).",AB_0424
"breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women worldwide. early detection is crucial for a high possibility of recovery, but current diagnostic procedures rely on visual inspection by doctors, which is timeconsuming, requires consultation, and lacks reliable automatic detection systems. therefore, an automatic diagnosis system based on machine learning (ml) models is highly required to improve the accuracy of detection and prediction. in this study, an efficient classification method based on ml techniques was proposed to help doctors diagnose and distinguish between malignant and benign tumors relevant to breast cancer prediction. seven automl techniques, including orange, lazy predict, tpot, mljar, matlab classification learner, and autokeras, were examined and applied to eight different datasets to evaluate their performance in terms of classification accuracy. the experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement using state-of-the-art techniques, with lazy predict and matlab classification learner outperforming all other ml techniques for binary classification tasks. the contribution of this work is the identification of the best ml model among multiple models inside each automl technique applied to different breast cancer datasets. all datasets and codes used in this study are freely available from https://github.com/amrrashed/breast-cancer-datasets-and-codes.",AB_0424
"multi-view clustering methods are essential for the stratification of patients into sub-groups of similar molecular characteristics. in recent years, a wide range of methods have been developed for this purpose. however, due to the high diversity of cancer-related data, a single method may not perform sufficiently well in all cases. we present parea, a multi-view hierarchical ensemble clustering approach for disease subtype discovery. we demonstrate its performance on several machine learning benchmark datasets. we apply and validate our methodology on real-world multi-view patient data, comprising seven types of cancer. parea outperforms the current state-of-the-art on six out of seven analysed cancer types. we have integrated the parea method into our python package pyrea (https://github.com/mdbloice/pyrea), which enables the effortless and flexible design of ensemble workflows while incorporating a wide range of fusion and clustering algorithms.",AB_0424
"the jurassic rocks of gebel maghara, northern sinai, egypt, contain a well-preserved and highly diverse macrobenthic fauna, dominated by bivalves. this fauna, particularly bivalves and gastropods, have received little attention in the last 100 years. in an attempt to provide a sound database on the marine bivalve diversity of egypt during the jurassic period, a first faunal group, the protobranch bivalves, is reviewed in detail. sixteen taxa (three of them new), belonging to two orders, five families, and nine genera are systematically described and compared to closely related jurassic taxa from various locations, particularly in europe and india. new species are nuculoma douvillei n. sp., n. sinaiensis n. sp., and palaeoneilo aegyptiaca n. sp. in addition, palaeonucula cuneiformis (j. de c. sowerby), p. muensteri (goldfuss), dacryomya diana (d'orbigny), d. lacryma (j. de. c. sowerby), and praesaccella juriana cox are identified from jurassic strata of egypt for the first time. the younger records of the genus palaeoneilo have not been accepted by some researchers, since almost all exhibit only limited features. the genus occurs with certainty in the middle jurassic (bajocian-bathonian) rocks of egypt, based on well-preserved external and internal characters. similarly, dacryomya and ryderia from bathonian-kimmeridgian rocks of egypt are younger than previously recorded from other parts of the world. the identified genera have wide geographic ranges and have been reported from different faunal provinces, which suggests that latitudinal climate differences did not influence their distribution pattern to a great extent.uuid: https://zoobank.org/7f3a9185-d690-4563-bdc0-df1c8d42ec0d",AB_0424
"supervised learning, such as regression and classification, is an essential tool for analyzing modern high-throughput sequencing data, for example in microbiome research. however, due to the compositionality and sparsity, existing techniques are often inadequate. either they rely on extensions of the linear log-contrast model (which adjust for compositionality but cannot account for complex signals or sparsity) or they are based on black-box machine learning methods (which may capture useful signals, but lack interpretability due to the compositionality). we propose kernelbiome, a kernel-based nonparametric regression and classification framework for compositional data. it is tailored to sparse compositional data and is able to incorporate prior knowledge, such as phylogenetic structure. kernelbiome captures complex signals, including in the zero-structure, while automatically adapting model complexity. we demonstrate on par or improved predictive performance compared with state-of-the-art machine learning methods on 33 publicly available microbiome datasets. additionally, our framework provides two key advantages: (i) we propose two novel quantities to interpret contributions of individual components and prove that they consistently estimate average perturbation effects of the conditional mean, extending the interpretability of linear log-contrast coefficients to nonparametric models. (ii) we show that the connection between kernels and distances aids interpretability and provides a data-driven embedding that can augment further analysis. kernelbiome is available as an open-source python package on pypi and at https://github.com/shimenghuang/kernelbiome.",AB_0424
"this article proposes a new method for estimating the extrinsic calibration parameters between any pair of multibeam lidar sensors on a vehicle. unlike many state-of-the-art works, this method does not use any calibration pattern or reflective marks placed in the environment to perform the calibration; in addition, the sensors do not need to have overlapping fields of view. an iterative closest point (icp)-based process is used to determine the values of the calibration parameters, resulting in better convergence and improved accuracy. furthermore, a setup based on the car learning to act (carla) simulator is introduced to evaluate the approach, enabling quantitative assessment with ground-truth data. the results show an accuracy comparable with other approaches that require more complex procedures and have a more restricted range of applicable setups. this work also provides qualitative results on a real setup, where the alignment between the different point clouds can be visually checked. the open-source code is available at https://github.com/midemig/pcd_calib.",AB_0424

"many tools have been created to generate in silico proteome digests with different protease enzymes and provide usefulinformation for selecting optimal digest schemes for specific needs.this can save on time and resources and generate insights on the observableproteome. however, there remains a need for a tool that evaluatesdigest schemes beyond protein and amino acid coverages in the proteomicdomain. here, we present protview, a versatile in silico protease combination digest evaluation workflow that maps in silico-digested peptides to both protein and genome references,so that the potential observable portions of the proteome, transcriptome,and genome can be identified. the proteomic identification and quantificationof evidence for transcriptional, co-transcriptional, post-transcriptional,translational, and post-translational regulation can all be examined in silico with protview prior to an experiment. benchmarkingagainst biological data comparing multiple proteases shows that protviewcan correctly estimate performances among the digest schemes. protviewprovides this information in a way that is easy to interpret, allowingfor digest schemes to be evaluated before carrying out an experiment,in context that can optimize both proteomic and proteogenomic experiments.protview is available at https://github.com/sspuliasis/protview.",AB_0424
