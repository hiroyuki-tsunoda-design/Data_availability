"pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pdac) is an aggressive disease for which potent therapies have limited efficacy. several studies have described the transcriptomic landscape of pdac tumors to provide insight into potentially actionable gene expression signatures to improve patient outcomes. despite centralization efforts from multiple organizations and increased transparency requirements from funding agencies and publishers, analysis of public pdac data remains difficult. bioinformatic pitfalls litter public transcriptomic data, such as subtle inclusion of low-purity and non-adenocarcinoma cases. these pitfalls can introduce non-specificity to gene signatures without appropriate data curation, which can negatively impact findings. to reduce barriers to analysis, we have created pdacr (http://pdacr.bmi. stonybrook.edu, github.com/rmoffitt/pdacr), an open-source software package and web-tool with annotated datasets from landmark studies and an interface for user-friendly analysis in clustering, differential expression, survival, and dimensionality reduction. using this tool, we present a multi-dataset analysis of pdac transcriptomics that confirms the basal-like/ classical model over alternatives.",AB_0589
"background: motor learning experiments are typically performed in laboratory environments, which can be time-consuming and require dedicated equipment/personnel, thus limiting the ability to gather data from large samples. to address this problem, some researchers have transitioned to unsupervised online experiments, showing advantages in participant recruitment without losing validity. however, most online platforms require coding experience or time-consuming setups to create and run experiments, limiting their usage across the field. method: to tackle this issue, an open-source web-based platform was developed (https://experiments.neurro-lab. engin.umich.edu/) to create, run, and manage procedural skill learning experiments without coding or setup requirements. the feasibility of the platform and the comparability of the results between supervised (n = 17) and unsupervised (n = 24) were tested in 41 naive right-handed participants using an established sequential finger tapping task. the study also tested if a previously reported rapid form of offline consolidation (i.e., microscale learning) in procedural skill learning could be replicated with the developed platform and evaluated the extent of interlimb transfer associated with the finger tapping task.results: the results indicated that the performance metrics were comparable between the supervised and un-supervised groups (all p's > 0.05). the learning curves, mean tapping speeds, and micro-scale learning were similar to previous studies. training led to significant improvements in mean tapping speed (2.22 +/- 1.48 key-presses/s, p < 0.001) and a significant interlimb transfer of learning (1.22 +/- 1.43 keypresses/s, p < 0.05).conclusions: the results show that the presented platform may serve as a valuable tool for conducting online procedural skill-learning experiments.",AB_0589

"it is essential that the satellite laser ranging (slr) estimates of c-20 and c-30 are as reliable as possible for grace and grace follow-on science applications. experiments in combining slr and grace data indicated that not accounting for the influence of the higher-degree even zonal terms results in a lower trend for c-20 and slightly overestimates the annual variation. the data are insufficient for separating c-30 and c-50 within a month from the five satellites used in grace technical note 11 (tn11) (cheng & ries, 2016, https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/alldata/grace/docs/tn-11_c20_slr.txt). lares's eccentricity is extremely sensitive to the gravitational perturbations of c-30 and plays an important role in the reliable determination of c-30. applying a time-variable gravity (tvg) forward model (based on grace) for the higher-degree coefficients improves the recovery of the lower-degree coefficients, such as c-30, c-50, and c-60 when a grace-based empirical orthogonal function (eof) analysis is also applied. a better time series of c-20 and c-30 (represented by tn11e as the updated tn11) was determined from seven satellites (including -1 and 2, starlette, ajisai, stella, bec, and lares) and adjusting a degree and order 5 (5 x 5) field + c-60, c-61, and s-61 based on the tvg model and an eof analysis of grace. the estimated rate of the c-20 is comparable with that from tn14 (loomis et al., 2019, ), but the seasonal variations appear to be better recovered from this study. the time series of c-30 from this study is comparable with the grace rl06 solution for the period prior to march 2012 and appropriate for application to the grace-fo mission.",AB_0589
"recent advancements in deep learning techniques have transformed the area of semantic textmatching (stm). however, most state-of-the-art models are designed to operate with short documents such as tweets, user reviews, comments, and so on. these models have fundamental limitations when applied to long-form documents such as scientific papers, legal documents, and patents. when handling such long documents, there are three primary challenges: (i) the presence of different contexts for the same word throughout the document, (ii) small sections of contextually similar text between two documents, but dissimilar text in the remaining parts (this defies the basic understanding of similarity), and (iii) the coarse nature of a single global similarity measure which fails to capture the heterogeneity of the document content. in this article, we describe colde: contrastive long document encoder-a transformer-based framework that addresses these challenges and allows for interpretable comparisons of long documents. colde uses unique positional embeddings and a multi-headed chunkwise attention layer in conjunction with a supervised contrastive learning framework to capture similarity at three different levels: (i) high-level similarity scores between a pair of documents, (ii) similarity scores between different sections within and across documents, and (iii) similarity scores between different chunks in the same document and across other documents. these fine-grained similarity scores aid in better interpretability. we evaluate colde on three long document datasets namely, acl anthology publications, wikipedia articles, and uspto patents. besides outperforming the state-of-theart methods on the document matching task, colde is also robust to changes in document length and text perturbations and provides interpretable results. the code for the proposed model is publicly available at https://github.com/interdigitalinc/colde.",AB_0589
"this article(1) studies how to schedule hyperparameters to improve generalization of both centralized singlemachine stochastic gradient descent (sgd) and distributed asynchronous sgd (asgd). sgd augmented with momentum variants (e.g., heavy ball momentum (shb) and nesterov's accelerated gradient (nag)) has been the default optimizer for many tasks, in both centralized and distributed environments. however, many advanced momentum variants, despite empirical advantage over classical shb/nag, introduce extra hyperparameters to tune. the error-prone tuning is the main barrier for automl. centralized sgd: we first focus on centralized single-machine sgd and show how to efficiently schedule the hyperparameters of a large class of momentum variants to improve generalization. we propose a unified framework called multistage quasi-hyperbolic momentum (multistage qhm), which covers a large family of momentum variants as its special cases (e.g., vanilla sgd/shb/nag). existing works mainly focus on only scheduling learning rate a's decay, while multistage qhm allows additional varying hyperparameters (e.g., momentum factor), and demonstrates better generalization than only tuning a. we show the convergence of multistage qhm for general non-convex objectives. distributed sgd: we then extend our theory to distributed asynchronous sgd (asgd), in which a parameter server distributes data batches to several worker machines and updates parameters via aggregating batch gradients from workers. we quantify the asynchrony between different workers (i.e., gradient staleness), model the dynamics of asynchronous iterations via a stochastic differential equation (sde), and then derive a pac-bayesian generalization bound for asgd. as a byproduct, we show how a moderately large learning rate helps asgd to generalize better. our tuning strategies have rigorous justifications rather than a blind trial-and-error as we theoretically prove why our tuning strategies could decrease our derived generalization errors in both cases. our strategies simplify the tuning process and beat competitive optimizers in test accuracy empirically. our codes are publicly available https://github.com/jsycsjh/centralized-asynchronous-tuning.",AB_0589
"background: exposure to per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas) is ubiquitous and has been associated with an increased risk of several cardio-metabolic diseases. however, the metabolic pathways linking pfas exposure and human disease are unclear. objective: we examined associations of pfas mixtures with alterations in metabolic pathways in independent cohorts of adolescents and young adults.methods: three hundred twelve overweight/obese adolescents from the study of latino adolescents at risk (solar) and 137 young adults from the southern california children's health study (chs) were included in the analysis. plasma pfas and the metabolome were determined using liquid-chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. a metabolome-wide association study was performed on log-transformed metabolites using bayesian regression with a g-prior specification and g-computation for modeling exposure mixtures to estimate the impact of exposure to a mix-ture of six ubiquitous pfas (pfos, pfhxs, pfhps, pfoa, pfna, and pfda). pathway enrichment analysis was performed using mummichog and gene set enrichment analysis. significance across cohorts was determined using weighted z-tests.results: in the solar and chs cohorts, pfas exposure was associated with alterations in tyrosine metabolism (meta-analysis p = 0.00002) and de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (p = 0.03), among others. for example, when increasing all pfas in the mixture from low ( 30th percentile) to high ( 70th percentile), thyroxine (t4), a thyroid hormone related to tyrosine metabolism, increased by 0.72 standard deviations (sds; equivalent to a standardized mean difference) in the solar cohort (95% bayesian credible interval (bci): 0.00, 1.20) and 1.60 sd in the chs cohort (95% bci: 0.39, 2.80). similarly, when going from low to high pfas exposure, arachidonic acid increased by 0.81 sd in the solar cohort (95% bci: 0.37, 1.30) and 0.67 sd in the chs cohort (95% bci: 0.00, 1.50). in general, no individual pfas appeared to drive the observed associations. discussion: exposure to pfas is associated with alterations in amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism in adolescents and young adults. https:// doi.org/10.1289/ehp11372",AB_0589
"the covid-19 pandemic has required close examination of workforce-related stressors that over decades have contributed to widespread burnout, negative health outcomes, including mental health outcomes, and the loss of the well-educated professionals who are the future of the nursing profession. in the united states and globally, evidence points to factors known to diminish well-being, including inequities, issues of minority status, persistent discrimination, and demanding work environments. the american academy of nursing (aan), dedicated to organizational excellence, nursing leadership and evidence-based policy, develops statements reflecting its mission and those of its nursing affili-ates and corporate member, the american nurses association. within nursing, despite the efforts of its members toward advancement, professional fulfillment is often constrained by the systems in which nurses practice and workplace fac-tors over which they have little control. action by key organizations to initiate changes at systems levels in workplace safety, to increase professional mobility, and propel policies that increase access to health care resources could improve nurse well-being. this paper proposes recommendations from the aan expert panels on building health care system excellence, psychiatric mental health and substance use, and global health expert panels for the american academy of nursing to leverage related policy in the arenas of government and profes-sional/healthcare organizations. transforming health care work environments and advancing nurse well-being and equity can be accomplished through key, innovative policy changes. these will be achieved through collaboration among associations, organizations, nonprofit groups, and with the public and the media.cite this article: naegle, m.a., kelly, l.a., embree, j.l., valentine, n., sharp, d., grinspun, d., hines-martin, v.p., crawford, c.l., & rosa, w.e.

"background: refractory perianal crohn's disease remains notoriously difficult to treat. we developed a novel technology using a commercially available bioabsorbable fistula plug to deliver autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. objective: this study aimed to assess therapeutic safety and feasibility in the completed stomp (stem cells on matrix plugs) phase 1 clinical trial. design: prospective single-arm phase i clinical trial. setting: tertiary academic medical center. patients: adults (aged 18-65 y) with complex single-tract crohn's disease perianal fistula who have failed conventional therapy were included in this study. intervention: autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells were isolated, ex vivo culture expanded, and seeded onto a commercially available bioabsorbable fistula plug. six weeks later, patients returned to the operating room for removal of the seton and placement of the stem cell-loaded plug. main outcome measures: patients were followed up for a total of 8 visits through 12 months. safety was the primary end point; clinical healing and mri response were secondary end points. results: twenty patients (12 females; mean age 36 y) were treated with the stem cell-loaded plug. of the 20 patients enrolled, 3 were not included in the 12-month analysis because of study withdrawal. through 12 months, no patient experienced a serious adverse event related to the stem cell-loaded plug. four patients experienced 7 serious adverse events and 12 patients experienced 22 adverse events. complete clinical healing occurred in 14 of 18 patients at 6 months and 13 of 17 patients at 12 months. mri response was observed in 12 of 18 patients at 6 months. limitations: the main limitations were the small sample size and restrictive inclusion criteria. conclusions: a stem cell-loaded plug can safely and effectively deliver cell-based therapy for patients with single-tract fistulizing perianal crohn's disease. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c70.",AB_0589
"background: perineal wound complications after abdominoperineal resection continue to be a significant challenge. complications, ranging from 14% up to 60%, prolong hospitalization, increase risk of readmission and reoperation, delay the start of adjuvant therapy, and place psychological stress on the patient and family. objective: this study aimed to evaluate the impact of closed incision negative pressure therapy on perineal wound healing. design: this was a retrospective study. settings: the study was conducted in an academic community hospital. patients: patients who underwent abdominoperineal resection from 2012 to 2020 were included. main outcome measures: perineal wound complications within 30 and 180 days were the primary outcome measures. results: a total of 45 patients were included in the study. of these, 31 patients were managed with closed incision negative pressure therapy. the overall perineal wound complications were less frequent in the closed incision negative pressure therapy group (10/31; 32.2%) compared to the control group (10/14; 71.4%; chi(2)(1) = 5.99 [p = 0.01]). in the closed incision negative pressure therapy group, 2 patients (20%) did not heal within 180 days and no patient required reoperation or readmission. in the control group, 4 patients (44%) had not healed at 180 days and 1 patient required flap reconstruction. when the effect of other variables was controlled, closed incision negative pressure therapy resulted in an 85% decrease in the odds of wound complications (adjusted or 0.15 [95% ci, 0.03-0.60]; p = 0.01). limitations: the nonrandomized nature and use of historical controls in this study are its limitations. conclusions: the ease of application and the overall reduction in the incidence and severity of complications may offer an option for perineal wound management and possibly obviate the need for more expensive therapies. further prospective controlled trials are required to effectively study its efficacy. see video abstract at http:// links.lww.com/dcr/b895.",AB_0589
