"open international challenges are becoming the de facto standard for assessing computer vision and image analysis algorithms. in recent years, new methods have extended the reach of pulmonary airway segmentation that is closer to the limit of image resolution. since exact'09 pulmonary airway segmentation, limited effort has been directed to the quantitative comparison of newly emerged algorithms driven by the maturity of deep learning based approaches and extensive clinical efforts for resolving finer details of distal airways for early intervention of pulmonary diseases. thus far, public annotated datasets are extremely limited, hindering the development of data-driven methods and detailed performance evaluation of new algorithms. to provide a benchmark for the medical imaging community, we organized the multi-site, multi-domain airway tree modeling (atm'22), which was held as an official challenge event during the miccai 2022 conference. atm'22 provides large-scale ct scans with detailed pulmonary airway annotation, including 500 ct scans (300 for training, 50 for validation, and 150 for testing). the dataset was collected from different sites and it further included a portion of noisy covid-19 cts with ground-glass opacity and consolidation. twenty-three teams participated in the entire phase of the challenge and the algorithms for the top ten teams are reviewed in this paper. both quantitative and qualitative results revealed that deep learning models embedded with the topological continuity enhancement achieved superior performance in general. atm'22 challenge holds as an open-call design, the training data and the gold standard evaluation are available upon successful registration via its homepage (https://atm22.grand-challenge.org/).",AB_0214
"involuntary motion of the heart remains a challenge for cardiac computed tomography (ct) imaging. although the electrocardiogram (ecg) gating strategy is widely adopted to perform ct scans at the quasi-quiescent cardiac phase, motion-induced artifacts are still unavoidable for patients with high heart rates or irregular rhythms. dynamic cardiac ct, which provides functional information of the heart, suffers even more severe motion artifacts. in this paper, we develop a deep learning based framework for motion artifact reduction in dynamic cardiac ct. first, we build a pad (pseudo all-phase clinical-dataset) based on a whole-heart motion model and single-phase cardiac ct images. this dataset provides dynamic ct images with realistic-looking motion artifacts that help to develop data-driven approaches. second, we formulate the problem of motion artifact reduction as a video deblurring task according to its dynamic nature. a novel tt u-net (temporal transformer u-net) is proposed to excavate the spatiotemporal features for better motion artifact reduction. the self-attention mechanism along the temporal dimension effectively encodes motion information and thus aids image recovery. experiments show that the tt u-net trained on the proposed pad performs well on clinical ct scans, which substantiates the effectiveness and fine generalization ability of our method. the source code, trained models, and dynamic demo will be available at https://github.com/ivy9092111111/tt-u-net.",AB_0214
"deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in multi-type nuclei segmentation. these models are mostly trained at once with the full annotation of all types of nuclei available, while lack the ability of continually learning new classes due to the problem of catastrophic forgetting. in this paper, we study the practical and important class-incremental continual learning problem, where the model is incrementally updated to new classes without accessing to previous data. we propose a novel continual nuclei segmentation method, to avoid forgetting knowledge of old classes and facilitate the learning of new classes, by achieving feature-level knowledge distillation with prototype-wise relation distillation and contrastive learning. concretely, prototype-wise relation distillation imposes constraints on the inter-class relation similarity, encouraging the encoder to extract similar class distribution for old classes in the feature space. prototype-wise contrastive learning with a hard sampling strategy enhances the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of features, improving the performance on both old and new classes. experiments on two multi-type nuclei segmentation benchmarks, i.e., monusac and consep, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with superior performance over many competitive methods. codes are available at https://github.com/zzw-szu/conuseg.",AB_0214
"abnormal posture is a common movement disorder in the progress of parkinson's disease (pd), and this abnormality can increase the risk of falls or even disabilities. the conventional assessment approach depends on the judgment of well-trained experts via canonical scales. however, this approach requires extensive clinical expertise and is highly subjective. considering the potential of quantitative susceptibility mapping (qsm) in pd diagnosis, this study explored the qsm-based method for the automated classification between pd patients with and without postural abnormalities. nevertheless, a major challenge is that unstable non-causal features typically lead to less reliable performance. therefore, we propose a causality-driven graph-convolutional-network framework based on multi-instance learning, where performance stability is enhanced through the invariant prediction principle and causal interventions. specifically, we adopt an intervention strategy that combines a non-causal intervenor with causal prediction. a stability constraint is proposed to ensure robust integrated prediction under different interventions. moreover, an intra-class homogeneity constraint is enforced for each individually-learned causality scoring module to promote the extraction of group-level general features, and hence achieve a balance between subject-specific and group-level features. the proposed method demonstrated promising performance through extensive experiments on a real clinical dataset. also, the features extracted by our method coincide with those reported in previous medical studies on pd posture abnormalities. in general, our work provides a clinically-valuable approach for automated, objective, and reliable diagnosis of postural abnormalities in parkinsonians. our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/sjtubme-qianlab/causalgcn-pdpa.",AB_0214
"point cloud upsampling aims to generate dense point clouds from given sparse ones, which is a challenging task due to the irregular and unordered nature of point sets. to address this issue, we present a novel deep learning-based model, called pu-flow, which incorporates normalizing flows and weight prediction techniques to produce dense points uniformly distributed on the underlying surface. specifically, we exploit the invertible characteristics of normalizing flows to transform points between euclidean and latent spaces and formulate the upsampling process as ensemble of neighbouring points in a latent space, where the ensemble weights are adaptively learned from local geometric context. extensive experiments show that our method is competitive and, in most test cases, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction quality, proximity-to-surface accuracy, and computation efficiency. the source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/unknownue/puflow.",AB_0214
"the artifacts in histology images may encumber the accurate interpretation of medical information and cause misdiagnosis. accordingly, prepending manual quality control of artifacts considerably decreases the degree of automation. to close this gap, we propose a methodical pre-processing framework to detect and restore artifacts, which minimizes their impact on downstream ai diagnostic tasks. first, the artifact recognition network ar-classifier first differentiates common artifacts from normal tissues, e.g., tissue folds, marking dye, tattoo pigment, spot, and out-of-focus, and also catalogs artifact patches by their restorability. then, the succeeding artifact restoration network ar-cyclegan performs de-artifact processing where stain styles and tissue structures can be maximally retained. we construct a benchmark for performance evaluation, curated from both clinically collected wsis and public datasets of colorectal and breast cancer. the functional structures are compared with state-of-the-art methods, and also comprehensively evaluated by multiple metrics across multiple tasks, including artifact classification, artifact restoration, downstream diagnostic tasks of tumor classification and nuclei segmentation. the proposed system allows full automation of deep learning based histology image analysis without human intervention. moreover, the structure-independent characteristic enables its processing with various artifact subtypes. the source code and data in this research are available at https://github.com/yunboer/ar-classifier-and-ar-cyclegan.",AB_0214
"backgroundgenomic sequencing reads compressors are essential for balancing high-throughput sequencing short reads generation speed, large-scale genomic data sharing, and infrastructure storage expenditure. however, most existing short reads compressors rarely utilize big-memory systems and duplicative information between diverse sequencing files to achieve a higher compression ratio for conserving reads data storage space.resultswe employ compression ratio as the optimization objective and propose a large-scale genomic sequencing short reads data compression optimizer, named pmffrc, through novelty memory modeling and redundant reads clustering technologies. by cascading pmffrc, in 982 gb fastq format sequencing data, with 274 gb and 3.3 billion short reads, the state-of-the-art and reference-free compressors harc, spring, mstcom, and fastqcls achieve 77.89%, 77.56%, 73.51%, and 29.36% average maximum compression ratio gains, respectively. pmffrc saves 39.41%, 41.62%, 40.99%, and 20.19% of storage space sizes compared with the four unoptimized compressors.conclusionspmffrc rational usage big-memory of compression server, effectively saving the sequencing reads data storage space sizes, which relieves the basic storage facilities costs and community sharing transmitting overhead. our work furnishes a novel solution for improving sequencing reads compression and saving storage space. the proposed pmffrc algorithm is packaged in a same-name linux toolkit, available un-limited at https://github.com/fahaihi/pmffrc.",AB_0214

"automated counting of grape berries has become one of the most important tasks in grape yield prediction. however, dense distribution of berries and the severe occlusion between berries bring great challenges to counting algorithm based on deep learning. the collection of data required for model training is also a tedious and expensive work. to address these issues and cost-effectively count grape berries, a semi-supervised counting of grape berries in the field based on density mutual exclusion (cdmenet) is proposed. the algorithm uses vgg16 as the backbone to extract image features. auxiliary tasks based on density mutual exclusion are introduced. the tasks exploit the spatial distribution pattern of grape berries in density levels to make full use of unlabeled data. in addition, a density difference loss is designed. the feature representation is enhanced by amplifying the difference of features between different density levels. the experimental results on the field grape berry dataset show that cdmenet achieves less counting errors. compared with the state of the arts, coefficient of determination (r2) is improved by 6.10%, and mean absolute error and root mean square error are reduced by 49.36% and 54.08%, respectively. the code is available at https://github.com/youth-tang/cdmenet-main.",AB_0214
"with the continuous upgrading of high-throughput sequencing technology, a large amount of biological genome data has been deciphered and published. the research on functional genes of biological genomes urgently needs a collection of service websites with user-friendly and full annotation functions for a variety of gene function annotation tools. in this study, icazygfadb, which is a database website integrating nine gene function annotation tools, was perfectly developed to meet the needs of biological genome functional annotation. its nine gene function annotation tools were carbohydrate-active enzymes (cazyme) annotation, gene ontology (go) annotation, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) annotation, cluster of orthologous gene (cog) annotation, evolutionary genealogy of genes: non-supervised orthologous groups (eggnog) annotation, swissprot annotation, pfam annotation, kog annotation and animal transcription factor database (animaltfdb) annotation. it has three advantages. first, it is superior to gene function annotation of other biological cloud analysis platforms and runs very fast. second, all gene annotation functions of the website are free and open to users. third, it can annotate eight gene functions (go, kegg, cog, eggnog, swissprot, pfam, kog and animaltfdb annotation) of a single species at the same time, while other cloud platforms do not have the ability or need to charge to open for users to complete the annotation of eight gene functions at the same time. moreover, the development and operation of our database will provide great help for gene function annotation research and significantly improve the efficiency of genome function research and reduce the cost of bioinformatics analysis. genomic functional annotation researchers can access this database through the following website: http://www.icazygfadb.org.cn/.database url: http://www.icazygfadb.org.cn/",AB_0214
