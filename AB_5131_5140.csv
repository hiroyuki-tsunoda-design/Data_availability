"background: functionally related genes are well known to be often grouped in close vicinity in the genomes, particularly in prokaryotes. notwithstanding the diverse evolutionary mechanisms leading to this phenomenon, it can be used to predict functions of uncharacterized genes. methods: here, we provide a simple but robust statistical approach that leverages the vast amounts of genomic data available today. considering a protein domain as a functional unit, one can explore other functional units (domains) that significantly often occur within the genomic neighborhoods of the queried domain. this analysis can be performed across different taxonomic levels. provisions can also be made to correct for the uneven sampling of the taxonomic space by genomic sequencing projects that often focus on large numbers of very closely related strains, e.g., pathogenic ones. to this end, an optional procedure for averaging occurrences within subtaxa is available. results: several examples show this approach can provide useful functional predictions for uncharacterized gene families, and how to combine this information with other approaches. the method is made available as a web server at http://bioinfo.sggw.edu.pl/neighborhood_analysis.",AB_0514

"mimicry of host proteins is a strategy employed by pathogens to hijack host functions. domain and motif mimicry was explored in the experimental and predicted sars-cov-2-human interactome. the host first inter actor proteins were also added to capture the continuum of the interactions. the domains and motifs of the proteins were annotated using ncbi cd search and scanprosite, respectively. host and pathogen proteins with a common host interactor and similar domain/motif constitute a mimicry pair indicating global structural similarity (domain mimicry pair; dmp) or local sequence similarity (motif mimicry pair; mmp). 593 dmps and 7,02,472 mmps were determined. aaa, dexdc and macro domains were frequent among dmps whereas glycosylation, myristoylation and rgd motifs were abundant among mmp. the proteins involved in mimicry were visualised as a sars-cov-2 mimicry interaction network. the host proteins were enriched in multiple cvd pathways indicating the role of mimicry in covid-19 associated cvds. bridging nodes were identified as potential drug targets. approved antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory drugs are proposed for repurposing against covid-19 associated cvds. the sars-cov-2 mimicry data has been updated in imitatedb (http://imi tatedb.sblab-nsit.net/sarscov2mimicry). determination of key mechanisms, proteins, pathways, drug targets and repurposing candidates is critical for developing therapeutics for sars cov-2 associated cvds.",AB_0514

"with the ever-increasing use of games, game developers are expected to write efficient code and support several aspects such as security, maintainability, and performance. however, the need for frequent updates in game development may lead to quick-fix solutions and bad coding practices. though unintentional, these bad practices may lead to poor program comprehension and can cause several issues during software maintenance. the quick-fix solutions might lead to technical debts due to the presence of anti-patterns and code smells, which may affect the functional and non-functional requirements of the game. to avoid such instances, game developers may need some guidelines to refer to during the game development process. thus, to aid developers and researchers, in our previous work, we had presented an initial catalogue of anti-patterns in the domain of game development. to broaden the scope of the catalogue and diversify the instances of anti-patterns, we analyzed additional data from a q & a platform. we present 15 game-specific anti-patterns based on thematic analysis of 189 issues, 892 commits, 104 pull requests from 100 open-source github game repositories, and 971 questions from game development stack exchange. we see the catalogue as an effort towards improving the development and quality of the games. the catalogue containing a detailed description of every anti-pattern with the context, problem, solution, example(s), and their occurrences on github and game development stack exchange is available at https://rishalab.github.io/catalog-of-game-antipatterns/. & copy; 2023 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.",AB_0514
"melanoma, despite its relatively low incidence compared to other types of skin cancer, accounts for a significant proportion of skin cancer-related deaths. early detection of melanoma is crucial for improving patient survival rates. deep learning algorithms, which heavily rely on data, are widely used in melanoma detection. however, the performance of these algorithms is greatly influenced by the distribution of the dataset, particularly class imbalance. in this manuscript, the authors present a novel method based on the kemeny-young rule for optimal rank aggregation to address the class imbalance problem in melanoma detection. the proposed approach aims to reduce class bias and enhance overall classification accuracy. furthermore, a cost-sensitive learning approach is introduced to improve the classifier's ability to handle class imbalance effectively. this novel cost-sensitive learning method utilizes self-adaptive differential evolution optimization to determine optimal weights for each class. our approach differs from traditional methods that assign weights based on predefined criteria. to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted on the highly imbalanced isic 2020 dataset, which is widely used in melanoma detection research. the kemeny-young rule-based majority voting achieves an overall error rate of 2.44%, while the cost-sensitive learning based on the self-adaptive differential evolution approach achieves an even lower error rate of 1.99%. moreover, the proposed method achieves a sensitivity of 87.93% and a specificity of 98.19%. these experimental results demonstrate the competitiveness and effectiveness of the proposed methods in addressing the challenges posed by class imbalance and improving the accuracy of melanoma detection. by effectively mitigating class imbalance, these methods improve the accuracy and reliability of melanoma detection, thus offering valuable insights for developing advanced computer-aided diagnosis systems in dermatology. the relevant codes for our proposed approach are publicly available at: https://github.com/ctrl-gaurav/handling-imbalanced-class-in-melanoma.",AB_0514

"background: gastrointestinal (gi) infections are quite common today around the world. colonoscopy or wireless capsule endoscopy (wce) are noninvasive methods for examining the whole gi tract for abnormalities. nevertheless, it requires a great deal of time and effort for doctors to visualize a large number of images, and diagnosis is prone to human error. as a result, developing automated artificial intelligence (ai) based gi disease diagnosis methods is a crucial and emerging research area. ai-based prediction models may lead to improvements in the early diagnosis of gastrointestinal disorders, assessing severity, and healthcare systems for the benefit of patients as well as clinicians. the focus of this research is on the early diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases using a convolution neural network (cnn) to enhance diagnosis accuracy. methods: various cnn models (baseline model and using transfer learning (vgg16, inceptionv3, and resnet50)) were trained on a benchmark image dataset, kvasir, containing images from inside the gi tract using n-fold cross-validation. the dataset comprises images of three disease states-polyps, ulcerative colitis, and esophagitis-as well as images of the healthy colon. data augmentation strategies together with statistical measures were used to improve and evaluate the model's performance. additionally, the test set comprising 1200 images was used to evaluate the model's accuracy and robustness. results: the cnn model using the weights of the resnet50 pre-trained model achieved the highest average accuracy of approximately 99.80% on the training set (100% precision and approximately 99% recall) and accuracies of 99.50% and 99.16% on the validation and additional test set, respectively, while diagnosing gi diseases. when compared to other existing systems, the proposed resnet50 model outperforms them all. conclusion: the findings of this study indicate that ai-based prediction models using cnns, specifically resnet50, can improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting gastrointestinal polyps, ulcerative colitis, and esophagitis. the prediction model is available at https://github.com/anjus02/gi-disease-classification.git.",AB_0514
"background preoperative prediction of prolonged postoperative opioid use (ppou) after total knee arthroplasty (tka) could identify high-risk patients for increased surveillance. the skeletal oncology research group machine learning algorithm (sorg-mla) has been tested internally while lacking external support to assess its generalizability. the aims of this study were to externally validate this algorithm in an asian cohort and to identify other potential independent factors for ppou. methods in a tertiary center in taiwan, 3,495 patients receiving tka from 2010-2018 were included. baseline characteristics were compared between the external validation cohort and the original developmental cohorts. discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [auroc] and precision-recall curve [auprc]), calibration, overall performance (brier score), and decision curve analysis (dca) were applied to assess the model performance. a multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate other potential prognostic factors. results there were notable differences in baseline characteristics between the validation and the development cohort. despite these variations, the sorg-mla (https://sorg-.apps.shinyapps.io/tjaopioid/) remained its good discriminatory ability (auroc, 0.75; auprc, 0.34) and good overall performance (brier score, 0.029; null model brier score, 0.032). the algorithm could bring clinical benefit in dca while somewhat overestimating the probability of prolonged opioid use. preoperative acetaminophen use was an independent factor to predict ppou (odds ratio, 2.05). conclusions the sorg-mla retained its discriminatory ability and good overall performance despite the different pharmaceutical regulations. the algorithm could be used to identify high-risk patients and tailor personalized prevention policy.",AB_0514
