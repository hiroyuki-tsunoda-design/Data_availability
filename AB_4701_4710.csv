"we consider a generic representation problem of internal coordinates (bond lengths, valence angles, and dihedral angles) and their transformation to 3-dimensional cartesian coordinates of a biomolecule. we show that the internal-to-cartesian process relies on correctly predicting chemically subtle correlations among t h e internal coordinates themselves, and learning these correlations increases the fidelity of the cartesian representation. we developed a machine learning algorithm, int2cart, to predict bond lengths and bond angles from backbone torsion angles and residue types of a protein, which allows reconstruction of protein structures better than using fixed bond lengths and bond angles or a static library method that relies on backbone torsion angles and residue types in a local environment. the method is able to be used for structure validation, as we show that the agreement between int2cart-predicted bond geometries and those from an alphafold 2 model can be used to estimate model quality. additionally, by using int2cart to reconstruct an idp ensemble, we are able to decrease the clash rate during modeling. the int2cart algorithm has been implemented as a publicly accessible python package at https://github.com/ thglab/int2cart.",AB_0471
"background: there is a lack of cost-effective and readily available access to evidence-based information to manage healthy behaviours for pregnant individuals. mobile health (mhealth) tools offer a cost-effective, interactive, personalized option that can be delivered anywhere at a time most convenient for the user. this study protocol was primarily developed to, i) assess the feasibility of the smartmoms canada intervention in supporting participants to achieve gestational weight gain (gwg) guidelines. the secondary objectives are to, ii) assess user experience with the app, measured by adherence to the program via app software metrics and fre-quency of use, iii) determine the impact of smartmoms canada app usage on the adoption of healthful behav-iours related to nutrition, physical activity and sleep habits, improvements in health-related quality of life, pregnancy-related complications, and symptoms of depression, and iv) investigate the potential extended ef-fects of the app on postpartum health-related outcomes. methods: this is a feasibility trial. pregnant individuals aged 18-40 years with pre-gravid body mass index be-tween 18.5 and 39.9 kg/m2, carrying a singleton fetus, having wi-fi access, and at <= 20 weeks' gestation will be recruited. eligible people will be followed from recruitment until 12 months postpartum. discussion: smartmoms canada is the first bilingual canadian-centric app designed for pregnant people. this mhealth intervention, with its ability to supply frequent interactions, provides pregnancy-related health knowledge to users, potentially leading to an improvement in pregnancy-related outcomes and behaviours, and, ultimately a reduction in the present economic burden related to in-person interventions.trial registration: isrctn, isrctn16254958. registered 20 december 2019, http://www.isrctn.com/ isrctn16254958.",AB_0471
"myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) are clonal hematopoietic disorders, representing high risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia, and frequently associated to somatic mutations, notably in the epigenetic regulator tet2. natural killer (nk) cells play a role in the anti-leukemic immune response via their cytolytic activity. here we show that patients with mds clones harbouringmutations in the tet2 gene are characterised by phenotypic defects in their circulating nk cells. remarkably, nk cells andmds clones from the same patient share the tet2 genotype, and the nk cells are characterised by increased methylation of genomic dna and reduced expression of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (kir), perforin, and tnf-a. in vitro inhibition of tet2 in nk cells of healthy donors reduces their cytotoxicity, supporting its critical role in nk cell function. conversely, nk cells from patients treated with azacytidine (#nct02985190; https://clinicaltrials.gov/) show increased kir and cytolytic protein expression, and ifn-gamma production. altogether, our findings show that, in addition to their oncogenic consequences in the myeloid cell subsets, tet2 mutations contribute to repressing nk-cell function in mds patients.",AB_0471
"the development of single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) technologies has greatly contributed to deciphering the tumor microenvironment (tme). an enormous amount of independent scrna-seq studies have been published representing a valuable resource that provides opportunities for meta-analysis studies. however, the massive amount of biological information, the marked heterogeneity and variability between studies, and the technical challenges in processing heterogeneous datasets create major bottlenecks for the full exploitation of scrna-seq data. we have developed immucan scdb (https://immucanscdb.vital-it.ch), a fully integrated scrna-seq database exclusively dedicated to human cancer and accessible to nonspecialists. immucan scdb encompasses 144 datasets on 56 different cancer types, annotated in 50 fields containing precise clinical, technological, and biological information. a data processing pipeline was developed and organized in four steps: (i) data collection; (ii) data processing (quality control and sample integration); (iii) supervised cell annotation with a cell ontology classifier of the tme; and (iv) interface to analyze tme in a cancer type-specific or global manner. this framework was used to explore datasets across tumor locations in a gene-centric (cxcl13) and cell-centric (b cells) manner as well as to conduct meta-analysis studies such as ranking immune cell types and genes correlated to malignant transformation. this integrated, freely accessible, and user-friendly resource represents an unprecedented level of detailed annotation, offering vast possibilities for downstream exploitation of human cancer scrna-seq data for discovery and validation studies.significance: the immucan scdb database is an accessible supportive tool to analyze and decipher tumor-associated single-cell rna sequencing data, allowing researchers to maximally use this data to provide new insights into cancer biology.",AB_0471
"to obtain accurate estimates for biodiversity and ecological studies, metabarcoding studies should be carefully designed to minimize both false positive (fp) and false negative (fn) occurrences. internal controls (mock samples and negative controls), replicates, and overlapping markers allow controlling metabarcoding errors but current metabarcoding software packages do not explicitly integrate these additional experi-mental data to optimize filtering. we have developed the metabarcoding analysis software vtam, which uses explicitly these elements of the experimental design to find optimal parameter settings that minimize fp and fn occurrences. vtam showed similar sensitivity, but a higher precision compared to two other pipelines using three datasets and two different markers (coi, 16s). the stringent filtering procedure im-plemented in vtam aims to produce robust metabarcoding data to obtain accurate ecological estimates and represents an important step towards a non-arbitrary and standardized validation of metabarcoding data for conducting ecological studies. vtam is implemented in python and available from: https://github.com/ aitgon/vtam. the vtam benchmark code is available from: https://github.com/aitgon/vtam_benchmark.(c) 2023 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of research network of computational and structural biotechnology. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0471
"inertial measurement unit (imu) plays an important role in inertial aided navigation on robots. however, raw imu data could be noisy, especially for low-cost imus, and thus requires efficient pre-processing or denoising before applying further navigation algorithms. conventional imu denoising approaches are mostly hand-crafted and may face concerns such as sensor modelling errors and generalization issues. several recent works leverage deep neural networks (dnns) to tackle this problem and achieve promising results. however, currently reported deep learning methods are based on supervised learning, requiring sufficient and accurate annotations. while in real-world applications, such annotations can be expensive or unavailable, making these methods not practical. to address the above research gap, we propose incorporating self-supervised learning and future-aware inference for imu denoising. the end-to-end navigation evaluation results on euroc and tum-vi datasets are promising. the code will be publicly available at https://github.com/kleinyuan/imudb.",AB_0471
"objective the aim of this paper was to identify and characterize all the segmental radiculomedullary arteries (rmas) that supply the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord. methods all rmas from t4 to l5 were studied systematically in 25 cadaveric specimens. the rma with the greatest diameter in each specimen was termed the artery of adamkiewicz (aka). other supporting rmas were also identified and characterized. results a total of 27 akas were found in 25 specimens. twenty-two akas (81%) originated from a left thoracic or a left lumbar radicular branch, and 5 (19%) arose from the right. two specimens (8%) had two akas each: one specimen with two akas on the left side and the other specimen with one aka on each side. eight cadaveric specimens (32%) had 10 additional rmas; among those, a single additional rma was found in 6 specimens (75%), and 2 additional rmas were found in each of the remaining 2 specimens (25%). of those specimens with a single additional rma, the supporting rma was ipsilateral to the aka in 5 specimens (83%) and contralateral in only 1 specimen (17%). the specimens containing 2 additional rmas were all (100%) ipsilateral to their respective akas. conclusions the segmental rmas supplying the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord can be unilateral, bilateral, or multiple. multiple akas or additional rmas supplying a single anterior spinal artery are common and should be considered when dealing with the spinal cord at the thoracolumbar level. https:// thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.5.spine2214",AB_0471

"increased von willebrand factor (vwf) clearance plays a key role in the pathogenesis of type 1 and type 2 von willebrand disease (vwd). however, the pathological mechanisms involved in patients with mild to moderate reductions in plasma vwf:ag (range, 30-50 iu/dl; low vwf) remain poorly understood. in this study, we investigated the hypothesis that enhanced vwf clearance may contribute to the pathobiology of low vwf. patients with low vwf were recruited to the lovic study after ethics approval and receipt of informed consent. desmopressin was administered iv in 75 patients, and blood samples were drawn at baseline and at the 1-hour and 4-hour time points. as defined by recent ash/isth/nhf/ wfh guidelines, 20% of our low-vwf cohort demonstrated significantly enhanced vwf clearance. importantly, from a clinical perspective, this enhanced vwf clearance was seen after desmopressin infusion, but did not affect the steady-state vwf propeptide (vwfpp)-to-vwf antigen (vwf:ag) ratio (vwfpp/vwf:ag) in most cases. the discrepancy between the vwfpp/vwf:ag ratio and desmopressin fall-off rates in patients with mild quantitative vwd may have reflected alteration in vwfpp clearance kinetics. finally, bleeding scores were significantly lower in patients with low vwf with enhanced vwf clearance, compared with those in whom reduced vwf biosynthesis represented the principle pathogenic mechanism. this trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as #nct03167320.",AB_0471
"background: malignant pleural mesothelioma (mpm) is a rare understudied cancer associated with exposure to asbestos. so far, mpm patients have benefited marginally from the genomics medicine revolution due to the limited size or breadth of existing molecular studies. in the context of the mesomics project, we have performed the most comprehensive molecular characterization of mpm to date, with the underlying dataset made of the largest whole-genome sequencing series yet reported, together with transcriptome sequencing and methylation arrays for 120 mpm patients. results: we first provide comprehensive quality controls for all samples, of both raw and processed data. due to the difficulty in collecting specimens from such rare tumors, a part of the cohort does not include matched normal material. we provide a detailed analysis of data processing of these tumor-only samples, showing that all somatic alteration calls match very stringent criteria of precision and recall. finally, integrating our data with previously published multiomic mpm datasets (n = 374 in total), we provide an extensive molecular phenotype map of mpm based on the multitask theory. the generated map can be interactively explored and interrogated on the ucsc tumormap portal (https://tumormap.ucsc.edu/?p=rcg_mesomics/mpm_archetypes ). conclusions: this new high-quality mpm multiomics dataset, together with the state-of-art bioinformatics and interactive visualization tools we provide, will support the development of precision medicine in mpm that is particularly challenging to implement in rare cancers due to limited molecular studies.",AB_0471
