"deepmtp is a python framework designed to be compatible with the majority of machine learning subareas that fall under the umbrella of multi-target prediction (mtp). multi-target prediction includes problem settings like multi-label classification, multivariate regression, multi-task learning, matrix completion, dyadic prediction, and zero-shot learning. instead of using separate methodologies for the different problem settings, the proposed framework employs a single flexible two-branch neural network architecture that has been proven to be effective across the majority of mtp problem settings. to our knowledge, this is the first attempt at providing a framework that is compatible with more than two mtp problem settings. the source code of the framework is available at https://github.com/diliadis/deepmtp and an extension with a graphical user-interface is available at https://github.com/diliadis/deepmtp_gui.(c) 2023 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0531
"recognizing human actions in video sequences, known as human action recognition (har), is a challenging task in pattern recognition. while convolutional neural networks (convnets) have shown remarkable success in image recognition, they are not always directly applicable to har, as temporal features are critical for accurate classification. in this paper, we propose a novel dynamic pso-convnet model for learning actions in videos, building on our recent work in image recognition. our approach leverages a framework where the weight vector of each neural network represents the position of a particle in phase space, and particles share their current weight vectors and gradient estimates of the loss function. to extend our approach to video, we integrate convnets with state-of-the-art temporal methods such as transformer and recurrent neural networks. our experimental results on the ucf-101 dataset demonstrate substantial improvements of up to 9% in accuracy, which confirms the effectiveness of our proposed method. in addition, we conducted experiments on larger and more variety of datasets including kinetics-400 and hmdb-51 and obtained preference for collaborative learning in comparison with non-collaborative learning (individual learning). overall, our dynamic pso-convnet model provides a promising direction for improving har by better capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of human actions in videos. the code is available at https:// github. com/ leonl ha/ video- action- recog nition- colla borat ive- learn ing- with- dynam ics- via- pso- convn et- trans former.",AB_0531
"motivation single-cell rna-sequencing enables cell-level investigation of cell differentiation, which can be modelled using trajectory inference methods. while tremendous effort has been put into designing these methods, inferring accurate trajectories automatically remains difficult. therefore, the standard approach involves testing different trajectory inference methods and picking the trajectory giving the most biologically sensible model. as the default parameters are often suboptimal, their tuning requires methodological expertise.results we introduce totem, an open-source, easy-to-use r package designed to facilitate inference of tree-shaped trajectories from single-cell data. totem generates a large number of clustering results, estimates their topologies as minimum spanning trees, and uses them to measure the connectivity of the cells. besides automatic selection of an appropriate trajectory, cell connectivity enables to visually pinpoint branching points and milestones relevant to the trajectory. furthermore, testing different trajectories with totem is fast, easy, and does not require in-depth methodological knowledge.availability and implementation totem is available as an r package at https://github.com/elolab/totem.",AB_0531
"archival maps are an important source of information on the state of glaciers in polar zones and are very often basic research data for analysing changes in glacier mass, extent, and geometry. however, basing a quantitative analysis on archival maps requires that they be standardised and precisely matched against modern-day cartographic materials. this can be achieved effectively using techniques and tools from the field of geographic information systems (i.e. gis). the objective of this research was to accurately register archival topographic maps of the area surrounding the hornsund fjord (southern spitsbergen) published by the polish academy of sciences and to evaluate their potential for use in studying changes in the geometry of glaciers in the north-western part of the s & oslash;rkapp land peninsula in the following periods: 1961-1990, 1990-2010, and 1961-2010. the area occupied by the investigated glaciers in the north-western s & oslash;rkapp land decreased in the years 1961-2010 by 45.6 km(2), i.e. by slightly over 16 %. the rate of glacier area change varied over time and amounted to 0.85 km(2) yr(-1) in the period 1961-1990 and sped up to 1.05 km(2) yr(-1) after 1990. this process was accompanied by glacier surface lowering by about 90-100 m for the largest land-terminating glaciers on the peninsula and by up to more than 120 m for tidewater glaciers (above the line marking their 1984 extents). the dataset is now available from the zenodo web portal: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4573129 (dudek and p & eogon;tlicki, 2021).",AB_0531
"background: pain accompanying office hysteroscopy, possibly aggravated by urogenital atrophy, is the most common reason for its discontinuation. the aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of vaginal estriol and hyaluronic acid to facilitate the office hysteroscopy in peri and postmenopausal women. methods: a prospective cohort study involved women aged 45-90 years subjected to office hysteroscopy. women were assigned to three study arms: (a) 0.5 mg of estriol in vaginal cream twice daily for 10 days pre-procedure, (b) 5 mg of hyaluronic acid in vaginal gel twice daily for 10 days pre-procedure, (c) no medication. the following endpoints were compared: pain accompanying the procedure, need for cervical dilation, time of cervical passage, incidence of severe urogenital atrophy, and vaso-vagal reaction. results: there were no significant differences between the arms in terms of pain intensity during (p = 0.93) and after the procedure (p = 0.17), need for cervical dilation (p = 0.5), cervical passage time (p = 0.1), severe urogenital atrophy (p = 0.15), and vaso-vagal reaction (p = 0.29). conclusions: despite unfavorable conditions in peri and postmenopausal women, cervical preparation in the above regimens did not seem to bring clinically significant benefits. clinical trial registration: the study was registered under the number nct05783479 in the protocol registration and results system database (https://clinicaltrials.gov/). the database used for the study was made available in harvard dataverse (https://doi.org/10.7910/dvn/hswurd).",AB_0531
"background: this study aims to present a novel technique that integrates intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (ionm) into laparoscopy for continuous monitoring of pelvic nerves at risk during surgery to ensure their protection. methods: this is a prospective analysis of 10 consecutive patients receiving surgical treatment for proven diagnosis of lumbosacral plexus nerve entrapment. patients with symptoms of chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and severe, burning sharp pain on the lower extremity dermatomes were included. laparoscopic decompression of lumbosacral plexus nerve entrapment with intraoperative neuromonitoring was per-formed between january 2021 and february 2022. intraoperative neuromonitoring records (spontaneous electromyography (emg), free-run emg recordings, transcranial electrical motor-evoked potentials (tcmep) recordings, direct nerve root stimulation recordings, and compound muscle action potentials (cmaps) recordings) and preoperative and postoperative pain symptoms at one month were analyzed. results: the median age of the patients was 29 (25-44) years. neurovascular conflict, fibrosis, and abnormal piriformis mus-cle were identified as the three main etiologies of nerve entrapments. there were no statistically significant differences in transcranial motor evoked potential responses on the operated extremity side before and after decompression surgery or in the amplitude difference changes of tcmep responses between the operated and non-operated extremity sides (p > 0.05). dyspareunia visual analogue scale (vas) scores showed a significant decrease at the first month postoperatively (p-value = 0.027). conclusions: integrating intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring into laparoscopy facilitates the monitoring of the patient's motor function and prevents both permanent and transient nerve damage during pelvic nerve decompression surgery. this technique holds promise in enhancing surgical safety and preserving pelvic nerve function. the study was registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov (registration number nct06009640).",AB_0531
"background: uterine compression methods reduce the amount of postpartum bleeding. in our study, we investigated the effect of fundal pressure, which will be created by a sandbag placed on the abdomen, on reducing post-cesarean bleeding. methods: a total of 482 patients who delivered by cesarean section (cs) in the obstetrics clinic of firat university faculty of medicine between january 2021 and december 2021 were included in this prospective, randomized, single-center study. there were two groups: control group (n = 246), weighted group (n = 236). a sandbag weighing approximately 3 kg was used as a fundal compression tool. hemoglobin (hb) and hematocrit (hct) concentrations and amount of vaginal bleeding were determined preoperatively and at the postoperative 8th and 24th hours. in addition, the time of milk coming from the breast and visual analogue scale (vas) were evaluated. results: the postoperative hb value at 24 hours was significantly lower in weighted group compared to control group. the estimated amount of postoperative bleeding (based on the number of pads) was higher in weighted group compared to control group. the time to onset of milk production from the breast at the postoperative 8th hour was significantly longer in weighted group compared to control group. postoperative vas scores at 24 hours were significantly higher in weighted group compared to control group. conclusions: applying fundal pressure by using a sandbag from the abdominal route seems ineffective in reducing the amount of bleeding after cs. it may even increase the amount of bleeding. clinical trial registration: the study was registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov/, registration number: nct06005831.",AB_0531

"backgroundthis study aimed to compare the effects of cognitive functional therapy (cft) and movement system impairment (msi)-based treatment on pain intensity, disability, kinesiophobia, and gait kinetics in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (cnslbp).methodsin a single-blind randomized clinical trial, we randomly assigned 91 patients with cnslbp into cft (n = 45) and msi-based treatment (n = 46) groups. an 8-week training intervention was given to both groups. the researchers measured the primary outcome, which was pain intensity (numeric rating scale), and the secondary outcomes, including disability (oswestry disability index), kinesiophobia (tampa kinesiophobia scale), and vertical ground reaction force (vgrf) parameters at self-selected and faster speed (force distributor treadmill). we evaluated patients at baseline, at the end of the 8-week intervention (post-treatment), and six months after the first treatment. we used mixed-model anova to evaluate the effects of the interaction between time (baseline vs. post-treatment vs. six-month follow-up) and group (cft vs. msi-based treatment) on each measure.resultscft showed superiority over msi-based treatment in reducing pain intensity (p < 0.001, effect size (es) = 2.41), odi (p < 0.001, es = 2.15), and kinesiophobia (p < 0.001, es = 2.47) at eight weeks. the cft also produced greater improvement in vgrf parameters, at both self-selected (fpf[p < 0.001, es = 3], spf[p < 0.001, es = 0.5], msf[p < 0.001, es = 0.67], war[p < 0.001, es = 1.53], por[p < 0.001, es = 0.8]), and faster speed, fpf(p < 0.001, es = 1.33, msf(p < 0.001, es = 0.57), war(p < 0.001, es = 0.67), por(p < 0.001, es = 2.91)] than the msi, except spf(p < 0.001, es = 0.0) at eight weeks.conclusionthis study suggests that the cft is associated with better results in clinical and cognitive characteristics than the msi-based treatment for cnslbp, and the researchers maintained the treatment effects at six-month follow-up. also, this study achieved better improvements in gait kinetics in cft. ctf seems to be an appropriate and applicable treatment in clinical setting.trial registrationthe researchers retrospectively registered the trial 10/11/2022, at https://www.umin.ac.jp/ with identifier number (umin000047455).",AB_0531
