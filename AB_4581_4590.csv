"sequence comparison tools for metagenome-assembled genomes (mags) struggle with high-volume or low-quality data. we present skani (https://github.com/bluenote-1577/skani), a method for determining average nucleotide identity (ani) via sparse approximate alignments. skani outperforms fastani in accuracy and speed (>20x faster) for fragmented, incomplete mags. skani can query genomes against >65,000 prokaryotic genomes in seconds and 6 gb memory. skani unlocks higher-resolution insights for extensive, noisy metagenomic datasets.",AB_0459
"the claudin multigene family is associated with various aberrant physiological and cellular signaling pathways. however, the association of claudins with survival prognosis, signaling pathways, and diagnostic efficacy in colon cancer remains poorly understood.methods: through the effective utilization of various bioinformatics methods, including differential gene expression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis protein-protein interaction (ppi) network analysis, survival analysis, single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssgsea), mutational variance analysis, and identifying receiver operating characteristic curve of claudins in the cancer genome atlas colon adenocarcinoma (coad).results: we found that: cldn2, cldn1, cldn14, cldn16, cldn18, cldn9, cldn12, and cldn6 are elevated in coad. in contrast, the cldn8, cldn23, cldn5, cldn11, cldn7, and cldn15 are downregulated in coad. by analyzing the public datasets gse15781 and gse50760 from ncbi-geo (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), we have confirmed that cldn1, cldn2, and cldn14 are significantly upregulated and cldn8 and cldn23 are significantly downregulated in normal colon, colon adenocarcinoma tumor, and liver metastasis of colon adenocarcinoma tissues from human samples. various claudins are mutated and found to be associated with diagnostic efficacy in coad.conclusion: the claudin gene family is associated with prognosis, immune regulation, signaling pathway regulations, and diagnosis of coad. these findings may provide new molecular insight into claudins in the treatment of colon cancer.",AB_0459
"generative models are frequently used for de novo design in drug discovery projects to propose new molecules. however, the question of whether or not the generated molecules can be synthesized is not systematically taken into account during generation, even though being able to synthesize the generated molecules is a fundamental requirement for such methods to be useful in practice. methods have been developed to estimate molecule synthesizability, but, so far, there is no consensus on whether or not a molecule is synthesizable. in this paper we introduce the retro-score (rscore), which computes a synthetic accessibility score of molecules by performing a full retrosynthetic analysis through our data-driven synthetic planning software spaya, and its dedicated api: spaya-api (https://spaya.ai). we start by comparing several synthetic accessibility scores to a binary chemist score as estimated by chemists on a bench of generated molecules, as a first experimental validation that the rscore is a reliable synthetic accessibility score. we then describe a pipeline to generate molecules that validate a list of targets while still being easy to synthesize. we further this idea by performing experiments comparing molecular generator outputs across a range of constraints and conditions. we show that the rscore can be learned by a neural network, which leads to a new score: rspred. we demonstrate that using the rscore or rspred as a constraint during molecular generation enables our molecular generators to produce more synthesizable solutions, with higher diversity. the open-source python code containing all the scores and the experiments can be found on (https://github.com/iktos/generation-under-synthetic-constraint).",AB_0459
"introduction a large portion of published evidence syntheses (es) do not conform to established standards. there is a growing number of reviews labeled as a systematized review, but authors do not always identify specific methodological adaptations or specify the biases these may introduce. objective the objective of this scoping review is to identify which methodological attributes common to evidence syntheses (es) are implemented or referenced in published systematized reviews. it also aims to 1) identify and collate, where available, the reasons authors characterize their study as a systematized review 2) determine whether any justifications provided were based on resource constraints or research goals, and 3) describe common characteristics of systematized reviews. inclusion criteria all articles that are titled as a systematized review, attempt a collocation and synthesis of existing literature, and include some methodology for their review process, will be included. materials and methods a title search will be conducted for the terms systematized or systematised in proximity to the term review in a selection of scholarly sources that offer broad coverage of literature in many disciplines: google scholar, lens, web of science core collection (web of science platform), scopus (elsevier platform), medline (ovid platform). screening and data extraction will be done in duplicate. screening will be conducted in covidence. data extraction will be done in google sheets. data extraction elements will include common methodological characteristics relating to various steps of the evidence synthesis process. descriptive, aggregate statistics, and categorization of reasons for selecting the systematized review type are the primary planned analysis for this review. data availability this is a registered report protocol. the data collected in this research project will be made available in the borealis repository (https://borealisdata.ca/) upon finalization of the study.",AB_0459
"motivation the method of genome-wide association studies (gwas) and metabolomics combined provide an quantitative approach to pinpoint metabolic pathways and genes linked to specific diseases; however, such analyses require both genomics and metabolomics datasets from the same individuals/samples. in most cases, this approach is not feasible due to high costs, lack of technical infrastructure, unavailability of samples, and other factors. therefore, an unmet need exists for a bioinformatics tool that can identify gene loci-associated polymorphic variants for metabolite alterations seen in disease states using standalone metabolomics.results here, we developed a bioinformatics tool, metgwas 1.0, that integrates independent gwas data from the gwas database and standalone metabolomics data using a network-based systems biology approach to identify novel disease/trait-specific metabolite-gene associations. the tool was evaluated using standalone metabolomics datasets extracted from two metabolomics-gwas case studies. it discovered both the observed and novel gene loci with known single nucleotide polymorphisms when compared to the original studies.availability and implementation the developed metgwas 1.0 framework is implemented in an r pipeline and available at: https://github.com/saifurbd28/metgwas-1.0.",AB_0459
"research on growth mixture models (gmms) for analyzing data from a complex sample survey is sparse. existing methods use pseudo-likelihood in which survey weights are incorporated into the likelihood function, with variance estimated via linearization or resampling techniques. despite popularity of the pseudo-likelihood approach, weighted estimation introduces the risk of efficiency loss. in this paper we propose a bayesian gmm for complex survey data in which sample design features, such as stratification, clustering, and unequal probability of selection, are incorporated as covariates or hierarchical variance components. the bayesian gmm can yield a reduction in bias in the estimation of regression coefficients when design features are associated with survey outcomes, and can lead to more efficient estimates than the pseudo-likelihood estimators when the design is noninformative. we develop an efficient gibbs sampler that includes only closed-form full conditional distributions for model fitting. we present the results of a careful analysis of data from the galveston bay recovery study (gbrs) which used a stratified multi-stage cluster sample design. using our proposed bayesian gmm, we characterize longitudinal trajectories of post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) among residents of southeastern texas in the aftermath of hurricane ike. we identify four clinically meaningful ptsd trajectory subgroups and characterize risk factors associated with subgroup membership. in the absence of existing software that can be used to implement our proposed bayesian gmm for complex survey data, we built the r package bsvygmm for model fitting, selection, and checking which can be downloaded from https://github.com/anthopolos/bsvygmm.",AB_0459
"multi-person pose understanding from rgb videos involves three complex tasks: pose estimation, tracking and motion forecasting. intuitively, accurate multi-person pose estimation facilitates robust tracking, and robust tracking builds crucial history for correct motion forecasting. most existing works either focus on a single task or employ multi-stage approaches to solving multiple tasks separately, which tends to make sub-optimal decision at each stage and also fail to exploit correlations among the three tasks. in this paper, we propose snipper, a unified framework to perform multi-person 3d pose estimation, tracking, and motion forecasting simultaneously in a single stage. we propose an efficient yet powerful deformable attention mechanism to aggregate spatiotemporal information from the video snippet. building upon this deformable attention, a video transformer is learned to encode the spatiotemporal features from the multi-frame snippet and to decode informative pose features for multi-person pose queries. finally, these pose queries are regressed to predict multi-person pose trajectories and future motions in a single shot. in the experiments, we show the effectiveness of snipper on three challenging public datasets where our generic model rivals specialized state-of-art baselines for pose estimation, tracking, and forecasting. code is available at https://github.com/jimmyzou/snipper.",AB_0459
"background: long-term outcomes of patients with severe stroke remain poorly documented. we aimed to characterize one-year outcomes of patients with stroke requiring mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (icu).methods: we conducted a prospective multicenter cohort study in 33 icus in france (2017-2019) on patients with consecutive strokes requiring mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours. outcomes were collected via telephone interviews by an independent research assistant. the primary end point was poor functional outcome, defined by a modified rankin scale score of 4 to 6 at 1 year. multivariable mixed models investigated variables associated with the primary end point. secondary end points included quality of life, activities of daily living, and anxiety and depression in 1-year survivors.results: among the 364 patients included, 244 patients (66.5% [95% ci, 61.7%-71.3%]) had a poor functional outcome, including 190 deaths (52.2%). after adjustment for non-neurological organ failure, age =70 years (odds ratio [or], 2.38 [95% ci, 1.26-4.49]), charlson comorbidity index =2 (or, 2.01 [95% ci, 1.16-3.49]), a score on the glasgow coma scale <8 at icu admission (or, 3.43 [95% ci, 1.98-5.96]), stroke subtype (intracerebral hemorrhage: or, 2.44 [95% ci, 1.29-4.63] versus ischemic stroke: or, 2.06 [95% ci, 1.06-4.00] versus subarachnoid hemorrhage: reference) remained independently associated with poor functional outcome. in contrast, a time between stroke diagnosis and initiation of mechanical ventilation >1 day was protective (or, 0.56 [95% ci, 0.33-0.94]). a sensitivity analysis conducted after exclusion of patients with early decisions of withholding/withdrawal of care yielded similar results. we observed persistent physical and psychological problems at 1 year in >50% of survivors.conclusions: in patients with severe stroke requiring mechanical ventilation, several icu admission variables may inform caregivers, patients, and their families on post-icu trajectories and functional outcomes. the burden of persistent sequelae at 1 year reinforces the need for a personalized, multi-disciplinary, prolonged follow-up of these patients after icu discharge.registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct03335995",AB_0459
"the identification of condition-specific gene sets from transcriptomic experiments is important to reveal regulatory and signaling mechanisms associated with a given cellular response. statistical methods of differential expression analysis, designed to assess individual gene variations, have trouble highlighting modules of small varying genes whose interaction is essential to characterize phenotypic changes. to identify these highly informative gene modules, several methods have been proposed in recent years, but they have many limitations that make them of little use to biologists. here, we propose an efficient method for identifying these active modules that operates on a data embedding combining gene expressions and interaction data. applications carried out on real datasets show that our method can identify new groups of genes of high interest corresponding to functions not revealed by traditional approaches. software is available at https://github.com/claudepasquier/amine.",AB_0459
"motivation: studying the genetic makeup of viruses and phages through genome analysis is crucial for comprehending their function in causing diseases, progressing medicine, tracing their evolutionary history, monitoring the environment, and creating innovative biotechnologies. however, accessing the necessary data can be challenging due to a lack of dedicated comparative genomic tools and viral and phage databases, which are often outdated. moreover, many wet bench experimentalists may not have the computational proficiency required to manipulate large amounts of genomic data. results: we have developed vapex (virus and phage explorer), a web server which is supported by a database and features a user-friendly web interface. this tool enables users to easily perform various genomic analysis queries on all natural viruses and phages that have been fully sequenced and are listed in the ncbi compendium. vapex therefore excels in producing visual depictions of fully resolved synteny maps, which is one of its key strengths. vapex has the ability to exhibit a vast array of orthologous gene classes simultaneously through the use of symbolic representation. additionally, vapex can fully analyze user-submitted viral and phage genomes, including those that have not yet been annotated. availability and implementation: vapex can be accessed from all current web browsers such as chrome, firefox, edge, safari, and opera. vapex is freely accessible at https://archaea.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/vapex/.",AB_0459
