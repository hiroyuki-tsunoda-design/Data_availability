"motivation online assessment of tumor characteristics during surgery is important and has the potential to establish an intra-operative surgeon feedback mechanism. with the availability of such feedback, surgeons could decide to be more liberal or conservative regarding the resection of the tumor. while there are methods to perform metabolomics-based tumor pathology prediction, their model complexity predictive performance is limited by the small dataset sizes. furthermore, the information conveyed by the feedback provided on the tumor tissue could be improved both in terms of content and accuracy.results in this study, we propose a metabolic pathway-informed deep learning model (pideel) to perform survival analysis and pathology assessment based on metabolite concentrations. we show that incorporating pathway information into the model architecture substantially reduces parameter complexity and achieves better survival analysis and pathological classification performance. with these design decisions, we show that pideel improves tumor pathology prediction performance of the state-of-the-art in terms of the area under the roc curve by 3.38% and the area under the precision-recall curve by 4.06%. similarly, with respect to the time-dependent concordance index (c-index), pideel achieves better survival analysis performance (improvement of 4.3%) when compared to the state-of-the-art. moreover, we show that importance analyses performed on input metabolite features as well as pathway-specific neurons of pideel provide insights into tumor metabolism. we foresee that the use of this model in the surgery room will help surgeons adjust the surgery plan on the fly and will result in better prognosis estimates tailored to surgical procedures.availability and implementation the code is released at https://github.com/ciceklab/pideel. the data used in this study are released at https://zenodo.org/record/7228791.",AB_0454
"dynamical behaviour is one of the most crucial protein characteristics. despite the advances in the field of protein structure resolution and prediction, analysis and prediction of protein dynamic properties remains a major challenge, mostly due to the low accessibility of data and its diversity and heterogeneity. to address this issue, we present atlas, a database of standardised all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, accompanied by their analysis in the form of interactive diagrams and trajectory visualisation. atlas offers a large-scale view and valuable insights on protein dynamics for a large and representative set of proteins, by combining data obtained through molecular dynamics simulations with information extracted from experimental structures. users can easily analyse dynamic properties of functional protein regions, such as domain limits (hinge positions) and residues involved in interaction with other biological molecules. additionally, the database enables exploration of proteins with uncommon dynamic properties conditioned by their environment such as chameleon subsequences and dual personality fragments. the atlas database is freely available at https://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/atlas. graphical abstract",AB_0454
"in a constant evolving world, change detection is of prime importance to keep updated maps. to better sense areas with complex geometry (urban areas in particular), considering 3d data appears to be an interesting alternative to classical 2d images. in this context, 3d point clouds (pcs), whether obtained through lidar or photogrammetric techniques, provide valuable information. while recent studies showed the considerable benefit of using deep learning-based methods to detect and characterize changes into raw 3d pcs, these studies rely on large annotated training data to obtain accurate results. the collection of these annotations are tricky and time-consuming. the availability of unsupervised or weakly supervised approaches is then of prime interest. in this paper, we propose an unsupervised method, called deepcluster 3d change detection (dc3dcd), to detect and categorize multiclass changes at point level. we classify our approach in the unsupervised family given the fact that we extract in a completely unsupervised way a number of clusters associated with potential changes. let us precise that in the end of the process, the user has only to assign a label to each of these clusters to derive the final change map. our method builds upon the deepcluster approach, originally designed for image classification, to handle complex raw 3d pcs and perform change segmentation task. an assessment of the method on both simulated and real public dataset is provided. the proposed method allows to outperform fully-supervised traditional machine learning algorithm and to be competitive with fully-supervised deep learning networks applied on rasterization of 3d pcs with a mean of iou over classes of change of 57.06% and 66.69% for the simulated and the real datasets, respectively. the code is available at https://github.com/idegelis/torch-points3d-dc3dcd.",AB_0454
"with the ongoing digitization in archives, an increasing number of historical data becomes available for research. this includes historical aerial images which provide detailed information about the depicted area. among the applications enabled by these images are change detection of land use, land cover, glaciers, and coastal environments as well as the observation of land degradation, and natural hazards. studying the depicted areas and occurring 3d deformations requires the generation of a digital surface model (dsm) which is usually obtained via photogrammetric structure-from-motion (sfm). however, conventional sfm workflows often fail in registering historical aerial images due to their radiometric characteristics introduced by digitization, original image quality, or vast temporal changes between epochs. we demonstrate that the feature matching step in the structure from motion (sfm) pipeline is particularly crucial. to address this issue, we apply the two synergetic neural network methods superglue and disk, improving feature matching for historical aerial images. this requires several modifications to enable rotational invariance and leveraging the high resolution of aerial images. in contrast to other studies our workflow does not require any prior information such as dsms, flight height, focal lengths, or scan resolution which are often no more extent in archives. it is shown that our methods using adapted parameter settings are even able to deal with quasi texture-less images. this enables the simultaneous processing of various kind of mono-temporal and multi-temporal data handled in a single workflow from data preparation over feature matching through to camera parameter estimation and the generation of a sparse point cloud. it outperforms conventional strategies in the number of correct feature matches, number of registered images and calculated 3d points and allows the generation of multi-temporal dsms with high quality.with the flexibility of the method, it enables the automatic processing of formerly unusable or only to be interactively processed data, e.g. aerial images where the flight route is unknown, or with difficult radiometric properties. this makes it possible to go back even further in time, where the data quality usually decreases, and enables a holistic monitoring and comparison of environments of high interest. the code is made publicly available at https://github.com/tudipffmgt/hai-sfm.",AB_0454
"we present a major update of the hocomoco collection that provides dna binding specificity patterns of 949 human transcription factors and 720 mouse orthologs. to make this release, we performed motif discovery in peak sets that originated from 14 183 chip-seq experiments and reads from 2554 ht-selex experiments yielding more than 400 thousand candidate motifs. the candidate motifs were annotated according to their similarity to known motifs and the hierarchy of dna-binding domains of the respective transcription factors. next, the motifs underwent human expert curation to stratify distinct motif subtypes and remove non-informative patterns and common artifacts. finally, the curated subset of 100 thousand motifs was supplied to the automated benchmarking to select the best-performing motifs for each transcription factor. the resulting hocomoco v12 core collection contains 1443 verified position weight matrices, including distinct subtypes of dna binding motifs for particular transcription factors. in addition to the core collection, hocomoco v12 provides motif sets optimized for the recognition of binding sites in vivo and in vitro, and for annotation of regulatory sequence variants. hocomoco is available at https://hocomoco12.autosome.org and https://hocomoco.autosome.org. graphical abstract",AB_0454
"in an increasingly chemically polluted environment, rapidly characterizing the human chemical exposome (i.e., chemical mixtures accumulating in humans) at the population scale is critical to understand its impact on health. high-resolution mass spectrometry (hrms) profiling of complex biological matrices can theoretically provide a comprehensive picture of chemical exposures. however, annotating the detected chemical features, particularly low-abundant ones, remains a significant obstacle to implementing such approaches at a large scale. we present scannotation (https://github.com/scannotation/scannotation_software), an automated and user-friendly suspect screening tool for the rapid pre-annotation of hrms preprocessed data sets. this software tool combines several ms1 chemical predictors, i.e., m/z, experimental and predicted retention times, isotopic patterns, and neutral loss patterns, to score the proximity between features and suspects, thus efficiently prioritizing tentative annotations to verify. scannotation and ms-dial4 were used to annotate blood serum samples of 75 breton adolescents. scannotation's combination of ms1-based chemical predictors allowed us to annotate 89 chemically diverse environmental compounds with high confidence (confirmed by ms2 when available). these compounds included 62% of emerging molecules, for which no toxicological or human biomonitoring data are reported in the literature. the complementarity observed with ms-dial4 results demonstrates the relevance of scannotation for the efficient pre-annotation of large-scale exposomics data sets.",AB_0454
"pathbank (https://pathbank.org) and its predecessor database, the small molecule pathway database (smpdb), have been providing comprehensive metabolite pathway information for the metabolomics community since 2010. over the past 14 years, these pathway databases have grown and evolved significantly to meet the needs of the metabolomics community and respond to continuing changes in computing technology. this year's update, pathbank 2.0, brings a number of important improvements and upgrades that should make the database more useful and more appealing to a larger cross-section of users. in particular, these improvements include: (i) a significant increase in the number of primary or canonical pathways (from 1720 to 6951); (ii) a massive increase in the total number of pathways (from 110 234 to 605 359); (iii) significant improvements to the quality of pathway diagrams and pathway descriptions; (iv) a strong emphasis on drug metabolism and drug mechanism pathways; (v) making most pathway images more slide-compatible and manuscript-compatible; (vi) adding tools to support better pathway filtering and selecting through a more complete pathway taxonomy; (vii) adding pathway analysis tools for visualizing and calculating pathway enrichment. many other minor improvements and updates to the content, the interface and general performance of the pathbank website have also been made. overall, we believe these upgrades and updates should greatly enhance pathbank's ease of use and its potential applications for interpreting metabolomics data. graphical abstract",AB_0454
"motivation: the identification of cancer genes is a critical yet challenging problem in cancer genomics research. existing computational methods, including deep graph neural networks, fail to exploit the multilayered gene-gene interactions or provide limited explanations for their predictions. these methods are restricted to a single biological network, which cannot capture the full complexity of tumorigenesis. models trained on different biological networks often yield different and even opposite cancer gene predictions, hindering their trustworthy adaptation. here, we introduce an explainable multilayer graph neural network (emgnn) approach to identify cancer genes by leveraging multiple gene-gene interaction networks and pan-cancer multi-omics data. unlike conventional graph learning on a single biological network, emgnn uses a multilayered graph neural network to learn from multiple biological networks for accurate cancer gene prediction. results: our method consistently outperforms all existing methods, with an average 7.15% improvement in area under the precision-recall curve over the current state-of-the-art method. importantly, emgnn integrated multiple graphs to prioritize newly predicted cancer genes with conflicting predictions from single biological networks. for each prediction, emgnn provided valuable biological insights via both model-level feature importance explanations and molecular-level gene set enrichment analysis. overall, emgnn offers a powerful new paradigm of graph learning through modeling the multilayered topological gene relationships and provides a valuable tool for cancer genomics research. availability and implementation: our code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhanglab-aim/emgnn.",AB_0454
"apple scab and apple rust are the major classes of apple leaf diseases that gravely affect the apple yield. seeking an automatic, less expensive, fast yet precise method to detect plant diseases is crucial. traditional approaches to detect plant diseases using computer vision involve complex and labor-intensive methodologies that rely on image enhancement methods and hand-engineered features. the deep convolutional neural network models are highly favourable in performing image classification with many target classes without involving the arduous phase of feature engineering. in this paper, we utilized the capsule neural network (capsnet) architecture and modified the network structure by adding additional convolution layers to enhance the model's learning capacity to classify the apple diseases into apple rust, apple scab, healthy, and multiple diseases on the same leaf. model training was performed on a dataset of images that reflected complex growing conditions observed in the real world. the ability of the model to learn was improved by enhancing the images. experimentation was conducted on the kaggle plant pathology 2020 - fgvc7 dataset. experimental study demonstrated a recognition accuracy of 91.37% on the test set, with an overall improvement of 3.67% in accuracy when compared to the research work utilizing the same dataset in literature. therefore, the proposed method effectively achieves apple foliar leaf disease detection and surpasses existing state-of-the-art techniques applied to the same dataset.

"with the increasing occurrence and severity of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (chab) at the global scale, there is an urgent need for rapid, accurate, accessible, and cost-effective detection tools. here, we detail the roshab workflow, an innovative, in-the-field applicable genomics approach for real-time, early detection of chab outbreaks. we present how the proposed workflow offers consistent taxonomic identification of water samples in comparison to traditional microscopic analyses in a few hours and discuss how the generated data can be used to deepen our understanding on cyanobacteria ecology and forecast habs events. in parallel, processed water samples will be used to iteratively build the international cyanobacterial toxin database (icyatox; http://icyatox.ibis.ulaval.ca) containing the analysis of novel cyanobacterial genomes, including phenomics and genomics metadata. ultimately, roshab will (1) improve the accuracy of on-site rapid diagnostics, (2) standardize genomic procedures in the field, (3) facilitate these genomics procedures for non-scientific personnel, and (4) identify prognostic markers for evidence-based decisions in habs surveillance.",AB_0454
