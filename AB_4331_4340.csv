"motivation microbial sequences generated from clinical samples are often contaminated with human host sequences that must be removed for ethical and legal reasons. care must be taken to excise host sequences without inadvertently removing target microbial sequences to the detriment of downstream analyses such as variant calling and de novo assembly.results to facilitate accurate host decontamination of both short and long sequencing reads, we developed hostile, a tool capable of accurate host read removal using a laptop. we demonstrate that our approach removes at least 99.6% of real human reads and retains at least 99.989% of simulated bacterial reads. using hostile with a masked reference genome further increases bacterial read retention (>= 99.997%) with negligible (<= 0.001%) reduction in human read removal performance. compared with an existing tool, hostile removes 21%-23% more human short reads and 21-43 times fewer bacterial reads, typically in less time.availability and implementation hostile is implemented as an mit-licensed python package available from https://github.com/bede/hostile together with supplementary material.",AB_0434
"motivation analysis of mutational signatures is a powerful approach for understanding the mutagenic processes that have shaped the evolution of a cancer genome. to evaluate the mutational signatures operative in a cancer genome, one first needs to quantify their activities by estimating the number of mutations imprinted by each signature.results here we present sigprofilerassignment, a desktop and an online computational framework for assigning all types of mutational signatures to individual samples. sigprofilerassignment is the first tool that allows both analysis of copy-number signatures and probabilistic assignment of signatures to individual somatic mutations. as its computational engine, the tool uses a custom implementation of the forward stagewise algorithm for sparse regression and nonnegative least squares for numerical optimization. analysis of 2700 synthetic cancer genomes with and without noise demonstrates that sigprofilerassignment outperforms four commonly used approaches for assigning mutational signatures.availability and implementation sigprofilerassignment is available under the bsd 2-clause license at https://github.com/alexandrovlab/sigprofilerassignment with a web implementation at https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/assignment/.",AB_0434
"backgroundthe advent and continual improvement of high-throughput sequencing technologies has made immunoglobulin repertoire sequencing accessible and informative regardless of study species. however, to fully map dynamic changes in polyclonal responses precise framework and complementarity determining region annotation of rearranging genes is pivotal. most sequence annotation tools are designed primarily for use with human and mouse antibody sequences which use databases with fixed species lists, applying very specific assumptions which select against unique structural characteristics. for this reason, data agnostic tools able to learn from presented data can be very useful with new species or with novel datasets.resultswe have developed igmat, which utilises a reduced amino acid alphabet, that incorporates multiple hmm alignments into a single consensus to automatically annotate immunoglobulin sequences from most organisms. additionally, the software allows the incorporation of user defined databases to better represent the species and/or antibody class of interest. to demonstrate the accuracy and utility of igmat, we present analysis of sequences extracted from structural data and immunoglobulin sequence datasets from several different species.conclusionsigmat is fully open-sourced and freely available on github (https://github.com/tpi-immunogenetics/igmat) for download under gplv3 license. it can be used as a cli application or as a python module to be integrated in custom scripts.",AB_0434
"backgroundprehabilitation and recovery programmes aim to optimise patients' physical fitness and mental well-being before, during and after cancer treatment. this paper aimed to understand the impact of such a programme on emotional well-being in individuals undergoing cancer surgery. the programme was multi-modal, containing physical activity, well-being and nutritional support.methodsqualitative interviews were conducted with 16 individuals who participated in a prehabilitation and recovery programme. twenty-four health care staff involved in referral completed an online survey. an inductive, thematic analysis was conducted, integrating perspectives of patients and staff, structured with the framework approach.resultspatients seemed to experience emotional benefits from the programme, appearing less anxious and more confident in their ability to cope with treatment. they seemed to value having something positive to focus on and control over an aspect of treatment. ongoing, implicit psychological support provided by exercise specialists, who were perceived as expert, available and caring, seemed valued. some patients appeared to appreciate opportunities to talk about cancer with peers and professionals. discomfort with talking about cancer with other people, outside of the programme, was expressed.conclusionsparticipation in a prehabilitation and recovery programme appeared to yield valuable emotional well-being benefits, even without referral to specialist psychological support.study registrationthe study protocol was uploaded onto the open science framework 24 september 2020 (https://osf.io/347qj/).",AB_0434
"as demand for the automation of biological assays has increased over recent years, the range of measurement types implemented by multiwell plate readers has broadened and the list of published software packages that caters to their analysis has grown. however, most plate readers export data in esoteric formats with little or no metadata, while most analytical software packages are built to work with tidy data accompanied by associated metadata. 'parser' functions are therefore required to prepare raw data for analysis. such functions are instrument- and data type-specific, and to date, no generic tool exists that can parse data from multiple data types or multiple plate readers, despite the potential for such a tool to speed up access to analysed data and remove an important barrier for less confident coders. we have developed the interactive web application, parsley, to bridge this gap. unlike conventional programmatic parser functions, parsley makes few assumptions about exported data, instead employing user inputs to identify and extract data from data files. in doing so, it is designed to enable any user to parse plate reader data and can handle a wide variety of instruments (10+) and data types (53+). parsley is freely available via a web interface, enabling access to its unique plate reader data parsing functionality, without the need to install software or write code. availability and implementation the parsley web application can be accessed at: https://gbstan.shinyapps.io/parsleyapp/. the source code is available at: https://github.com/ec363/parsleyapp and is archived on zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/10011752.",AB_0434
"with the implementation of the conphymp reporting tool as an element of peer review in frontiers in pharmacology, section ethnopharmacology and in other journals, this short perspective paper highlights the use of a new tool available via the website of the society for medicinal plant and natural product research (https://ga-online.org/best-practice/) and how to use it. the conphymp guidelines and the tool cover the relevant aspects which need to be reported when studying a plant extract using pharmacological, toxicological microbiological, clinical and other approaches. in our vision, science will only remain impactful if it is based on a drive for best practice, i.e., on a sound conceptual and methodological basis.",AB_0434
"motivation whole-genome sequencing studies of human tumours have revealed that complex forms of structural variation, collectively known as complex genome rearrangements (cgrs), are pervasive across diverse cancer types. detection, classification, and mechanistic interpretation of cgrs requires the visualization of complex patterns of somatic copy number aberrations (scnas) and structural variants (svs). however, there is a lack of tools specifically designed to facilitate the visualization and study of cgrs.results we present reconplot (rearrangement and copy number plot), an r package that provides functionalities for the joint visualization of scnas and svs across one or multiple chromosomes. reconplot is based on the popular ggplot2 package, thus allowing customization of plots and the generation of publication-quality figures with minimal effort. overall, reconplot facilitates the exploration, interpretation, and reporting of cgr patterns.availability and implementation the r package reconplot is available at https://github.com/cortes-ciriano-lab/reconplot. detailed documentation and a tutorial with examples are provided with the package.",AB_0434
"we test the convergence of fast simulations based on the comoving lagrangian acceleration (cola) method for predictions of the matter power spectrum, specialising our analysis in the redshift range 1 <= z <= 1.65, relevant to high-redshift spectroscopic galaxy surveys. we then focus on the enhancement of the matter power spectrum in modified gravity (mg), the boost factor, using the dvali-gabadadze-porrati (dgp) theory as a test case but developing a general approach that can be applied to other mg theories. after identifying the minimal simulation requirements for accurate dgp boost factors, we design and produce a cola simulation suite that we use to train a neural network emulator for the dgp boost factor. using mg-arepo simulations as a reference, we estimate the emulator accuracy to be of similar to 3% up to k = 5 h mpc-1 at 0 <= z <= 2. we make the emulator publicly available at: https://github.com/bartolomeof/ndgpemu.",AB_0434
"objectives this study aims to map existing literature describing how people with lived experience of self-harm have engaged in codesigning self-harm interventions, understand barriers and facilitators to this engagement, and how the meaningfulness of codesign has been evaluated.design scoping review by joanna briggs institute methodology. a protocol was published online (http://dx.doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/p52ud).data sources pubmed, embase, psycinfo, web of science, cochrane library, prospero, clinicaltrials.gov and relevant websites were searched on 24 december 2022 (repeated 4 november 2023).eligibility criteria we included studies where individuals with lived experience of self-harm (first-hand or caregiver) have codesigned self-harm interventions.data extraction and synthesis results were screened at title and abstract level, then full-text level by two researchers independently. prespecified data were extracted, charted and sorted into themes.results we included 22 codesigned interventions across mobile health, educational settings, prisons and emergency departments. involvement varied from designing content to multistage involvement in planning, delivery and dissemination. included papers described the contribution of 159 female, 39 male and 21 transgender or gender diverse codesigners. few studies included contributors from a minoritised ethnic or lgbtqia+ group. six studies evaluated how meaningfully people with lived experience were engaged in codesign: by documenting the impact of contributions on intervention design or through postdesign reflections. barriers included difficulties recruiting inclusively, making time for meaningful engagement in stretched services and safeguarding concerns for codesigners. explicit processes for ensuring safety and well-being, flexible schedules, and adequate funding facilitated codesign.conclusions to realise the potential of codesign to improve self-harm interventions, people with lived experience must be representative of those who use services. this requires processes that reassure potential contributors and referrers that codesigners will be safeguarded, remunerated, and their contributions used and valued.",AB_0434
"bacteria cooperate by working collaboratively to defend their colonies, share nutrients, and resist antibiotics. nevertheless, our understanding of these remarkable behaviours primarily comes from studying a few well-characterized species. consequently, there is a significant gap in our understanding of microbial social traits, particularly in natural environments. to address this gap, we can use bioinformatic tools to identify genes that control cooperative or otherwise social traits. existing tools address this challenge through two approaches. one approach is to identify genes that encode extracellular proteins, which can provide benefits to neighbouring cells. an alternative approach is to predict gene function using annotation tools. however, these tools have several limitations. not all extracellular proteins are cooperative, and not all cooperative behaviours are controlled by extracellular proteins. furthermore, existing functional annotation methods frequently miss known cooperative genes. we introduce socfinder as a new tool to find bacterial genes that control cooperative or otherwise social traits. socfinder combines information from several methods, considering if a gene is likely to [1] code for an extracellular protein [2], have a cooperative functional annotation, or [3] be part of the biosynthesis of a cooperative secondary metabolite. we use data on two extensively-studied species (p. aeruginosa and b. subtilis) to show that socfinder is better at finding known cooperative genes than existing tools. we also use theory from population genetics to identify a signature of kin selection in socfinder cooperative genes, which is lacking in genes identified by existing tools. socfinder opens up a number of exciting directions for future research, and is available to download from https://github.com/lauriebelch/socfinder.",AB_0434
