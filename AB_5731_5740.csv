"objective during the covid-19 pandemic, the authors' institution managed ventriculoatrial (va) shunt complications in 2 teenage patients in close proximity to a symptomatic covid-19 infection. systemic thrombotic events are an established complication of covid-19 infection due to a hypercoagulable state. thrombotic complications, particularly elevated central venous pressure, can cause va shunt failure. the true effect of covid-19 on patients with intravascular devices is currently unknown. in this study, the authors aimed to determine if there was an association between covid-19 infection and va shunt failure. methods trinetx, an aggregated electronic health record platform, was used to analyze data of more than 13 million us pediatric patients. two matched cohorts of patients < 18 years of age with a va shunt were defined. group 1 (n = 311) had a positive laboratory test for covid-19 from march 1, 2020, to march 31, 2022. group 2 (n = 311), a control group, had any medical appointment from march 1, 2020, to march 31, 2022, and never had a positive laboratory test for covid-19. the authors analyzed outcomes 1 year after testing positive for covid-19 in group 1, and after the medical appointment in group 2. outcomes included shunt complications, shunt revisions or replacements, and thromboembolic complications. to protect patient privacy, individual results of fewer than 10 patients are not specified in trinetx. results group 1 had a greater odds of mechanical shunt complication than group 2 (20% vs 4%, or 5.71, 95% ci 3.07-10.62). group 1 had a greater odds of shunt reoperation than group 2 (11% vs < 3%, or > 3.7, 95% ci 1.72-7.62). there were 1-10 patients in group 1 (<= 3% of group 1) who experienced a thromboembolism due to the shunt, compared with no patients in group 2 who had a thromboembolism due to the shunt. conclusions this analysis demonstrates an association of shunt complications, reoperations, and thromboembolic events in patients with va shunts following covid-19 infection. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2024.4.peds23517",AB_0574
"background: newborns can be exposed to inorganic arsenic (ias) through contaminated drinking water, formula, and other infant foods. epidemiological studies have demonstrated a positive association between urinary ias levels and the risk of developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) among u.s. adolescents and adults. objectives: the present study examined how oral ias administration to neonatal mice impacts the intestinal tract, which acts as an early mediator methods: neonatal mice were treated with a single dose of ias via oral gavage. effects on the small intestine were determined by histological examination, rna sequencing, and biochemical analysis. serum lipid profiling was analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography (fplc), and hepatosteatosis was characterized histologically and biochemically. liver x receptor-alpha (lxra) knockout (lxra-=- ) mice and liver-specific activating transcription factor 4 (atf4)-deficient (atf4 degrees hep) mice were used to define their roles in ias-induced effects during the neonatal stage. results: neonatal mice exposed to ias via oral gavage exhibited accumulation of dietary fat in enterocytes, with higher levels of enterocyte triglycerides and free fatty acids. these mice also showed accelerated enterocyte maturation and a longer small intestine. this was accompanied by higher levels of liver-derived very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein triglycerides, and a lower level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the serum. mice exposed during the neonatal period to oral ias also developed hepatosteatosis. compared with the control group, ias-induced fat accumulation in enterocytes became more significant in neonatal lxra-=- mice, accompanied by accelerated intestinal growth, hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatosteatosis. in contrast, regardless of enterocyte fat accumulation, hepatosteatosis was largely reduced in ias-treated neonatal atf 4 degrees hep mice. conclusion: exposure to ias in neonatal mice resulted in excessive accumulation of fat in enterocytes, disrupting lipid homeostasis in the serum and liver, revealing the importance of the gut-liver axis and endoplasmic reticulum stress in mediating ias-induced nafld at an early age. https://",AB_0574
"many modern frame interpolation approaches rely on explicit bidirectional optical flows between adjacent frames, thus are sensitive to the accuracy of underlying flow estimation in handling occlusions while additionally introducing computational bottlenecks unsuitable for efficient deployment. in this paper, we propose a flow-free approach that is completely end-to-end trainable for multi-frame video interpolation. our method, flavr, leverages 3d spatio-temporal kernels to directly learn motion properties from unlabeled videos and greatly simplifies the process of training, testing and deploying frame interpolation models. as a result, flavr delivers up to 6x speed up compared to the current state-of-the-art methods for multi-frame interpolation while consistently demonstrating superior qualitative and quantitative results compared with prior methods on popular benchmarks includingvimeo-90k, snu-film, and gopro. additionally, we showthat frame interpolation is a competitive self-supervised pre-training task for videos by demonstrating various novel applications of flavr including action recognition, optical flow estimation, and video object tracking. code and trained models are available in the project page: https://tarun005.github.io/ flavr/. we have provided additional qualitative results for frame interpolation as well as downstream applications in our video available using this web link https://paperid1300.s3.us- west- 2.amazonaws.com/ flavrvideo.mp4 (link).",AB_0574

"background: despite their higher incidence of colorectal cancer, ethnoracial minority and low-income patients have reduced access to elective colorectal cancer surgery. although the affordable care act's medicaid expansion increased screening of colonoscopies, its effect on disparities in elective colorectal cancer surgery remains unknown. objective: this study assessed the effects of medicaid expansion on elective colorectal cancer surgery rates overall and by race-ethnicity and income. design: using the 2012 to 2015 state inpatient databases, a retrospective cohort study was conducted. settings: state inpatient databases from 3 expansion states (maryland, new jersey, and kentucky) and 2 nonexpansion states (florida and north carolina) were used. patients: this study examined 22,304 adult patients aged 18 to 64 years who underwent colorectal cancer surgery. main outcome measures: using interrupted time series analysis, the effect of medicaid expansion on the odds of elective colorectal cancer surgery was assessed. results: elective vs nonelective surgery rates remained unchanged overall (70.2% vs 70.7%, p = 0.63) and in ethnoracial minorities in expansion states (whites from 72.8% to 73.8% pre to post, p = 0.40 and non-white from 64.0% to 63.1% pre to post, p = 0.67). there was an instantaneous increase in odds of elective surgery in expansion vs nonexpansion states at policy implementation (adjusted or 1.37; 95% ci, 1.05-1.79; p = 0.02), but it subsequently decreased (combined adjusted or 0.95; 95% ci, 0.92-0.99; p = 0.03). elective surgery rates were also unchanged among ethnoracial minorities (instantaneous changes in expansion states, combined effect 1.06; pre-trend 1.01 vs post-trend 0.98) and low-income persons in expansion states (pre-trend 1.03 vs post-trend 0.97) (for all, p > 0.1). limitations: the study was limited to 5 states. although patients may have increased access to cancer screening services and surgery after expansion, the state inpatient databases only provide information on patients who underwent surgery. conclusions: despite gains in screening, medicaid expansion was not associated with reductions in known ethnoracial or income-based disparities in elective colorectal cancer surgery rates. expanding access to colorectal cancer surgery for underserved populations likely requires attention to provider and health system factors contributing to persistent disparities. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c217.",AB_0574
"much of the host antiviral response is mediated through changes to host gene expression levels. likewise, viruses induce changes to host gene expression levels in order to promote the viral life cycle and evade the host immune system. however, there is no resource that specifically collects human gene expression levels pre- and post-virus infection. further, public gene expression repositories do not contain enough specialized metadata to easily find relevant experiments. here, we present the virus expression database (vexd), a freely available website and database, that collects human gene expression datasets in response to viral infection. vexd contains similar to 8,000 uniformly processed samples obtained from 289 studies examining 51 distinct human viruses. we show that the vexd processing pipeline captures known antiviral responses in the form of interferon-stimulated genes. we further show that the datasets collected in vexd can be used to quickly identify supporting data for experiments performed in human cells or model organisms. vexd is freely available at https://vexd.cchmc.org/.",AB_0574

"background: standard management of stage iii colon cancer includes surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. despite improved overall survival with adjuvant chemotherapy in stage iii colon cancer, it is reportedly underused in older adults. to date, no contemporary national analysis of adjuvant chemotherapy use and its impact on older adults with stage iii colon cancer exists. objective: this study aimed to assess the current use of adjuvant chemotherapy in older adults with stage iii colon cancer and determine factors associated with noncompliance. design: retrospective cohort study. settings: conducted using the national cancer database. patients: this study included patients aged 65 years and older undergoing curative resection for stage iii colon adenocarcinomas, 2010-2017. main outcome measures: adjuvant chemotherapy use, factors associated with adjuvant chemotherapy use, and overall survival with and without adjuvant chemotherapy in older adults with pathologic stage iii disease. results: of 64,608 patients included, 64.3% received adjuvant chemotherapy. adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly independently associated with improved 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival vs no adjuvant chemotherapy (92.8%, 75.3%, 62.4% vs 70.8%, 46.6%, 32.7%; hr 0.475; 95% ci, 0.459-0.492; p <0.001). compared with the no adjuvant chemotherapy cohort, patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy were younger, female, and less comorbid (p < 0.001). factors associated with adjuvant chemotherapy noncompliance included advancing age, lower annual income, open approach, longer length of stay, pathologic stage iiia, and fewer than 12 lymph nodes. limitations: administrative data source with inherent risks of bias, coding errors, and limitations in the fields available for analysis. conclusions: adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival but was only used in 64.3% of older adults with stage iii colon cancer. adjuvant chemotherapy noncompliance was seen in the most vulnerable and highest-risk patients, including those with greater comorbidity, lower income, and patients who received open surgery. see video abstract at http://links. lww.com/dcr/c125.",AB_0574
"background: national comprehensive cancer network guideline adherence improves cancer outcomes. in rectal cancer, guideline adherence is distributed differently by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and insurance. objective: this study aimed to determine the independent effects of race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and insurance status on rectal cancer survival after accounting for differences in guideline adherence. design: this was a retrospective study. settings: the study was conducted using the california cancer registry. patients: this study included patients aged 18 to 79 years diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma between january 1, 2004, and december 31, 2017, with follow-up through november 30, 2018. investigators determined whether patients received guideline-adherent care. main outcome measures: ors and 95% cis were used for logistic regression to analyze patients receiving guideline-adherent care. disease-specific survival analysis was calculated using cox regression models. results: a total of 30,118 patients were examined. factors associated with higher odds of guideline adherence included asian and hispanic race/ethnicity, managed care insurance, and high socioeconomic status. asians (hr, 0.80; 95% ci, 0.72-0.88; p < 0.001) and hispanics (hr, 0.91; 95% ci, 0.83-0.99; p = 0.0279) had better disease-specific survival in the nonadherent group. race/ethnicity were not factors associated with disease-specific survival in the guideline adherent group. medicaid disease-specific survival was worse in both the nonadherent group (hr, 1.56; 95% ci, 1.40-1.73; p < 0.0001) and the guideline-adherent group (hr, 1.18; 95% ci, 1.08-1.30; p = 0.0005). disease-specific survival of the lowest socioeconomic status was worse in both the nonadherent group (hr, 1.42; 95% ci, 1.27-1.59) and the guideline-adherent group (hr, 1.20; 95% ci, 1.08-1.34). limitations: limitations included unmeasured confounders and the retrospective nature of the review. conclusions: race, socioeconomic status, and insurance are associated with guideline adherence in rectal cancer. race/ethnicity was not associated with differences in disease-specific survival in the guideline-adherent group. medicaid and lowest socioeconomic status had worse disease-specific survival in both the guideline nonadherent group and the guideline-adherent group. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/ b954.",AB_0574
"biofilms are communities of microorganisms that grow on virtually all surfaces with sufficient nutrients including aquatic and industrial water systems and medical devices. biofilms are complex, structured communities where the interplay of growth, metabolism, and competition between species interact with physical processes of diffusion, convection, attachment, and detachment. this work describes a model of a one-dimensional biofilm in a stirred tank reactor that incorporates these complexities. the model is implemented in the modern julia programming language providing an efficient tool for studying a large variety of biofilms and the intricate communities the microorganisms create. details of the new software, known as biofilm.jl, including the mathematical model and organization and execution of the code, are provided. examples of biofilms modeled using biofilm.jl are presented such as a single heterotroph, sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (sob) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb), and a phototroph. postprocessing tools are described that allow a biofilm.jl user to make plots and extract specific values from the solution and explore the simulated biofilm results. program summary program title: biofilm.jl cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /n8sgj48nvd .1 developer's repository link: https://github .com /markowkes /biofilm .jl code ocean capsule: https://codeocean .com /capsule /2341966 licensing provisions: mit programming language: julia (developed on v1.8, tested on v1.9) supplementary material: https://markowkes .github .io /biofilm .jl nature of problem: this software solves for the temporal and spatial dynamics of an arbitrary number of solutes and particulates (biomass species) in a one-dimensional biofilm. the model includes the growth of particulates and the associated solute consumption (or production), the biofilm thickness dynamics due to growth within and detachment from the top of the biofilm. additionally, source terms can be used to model the death of biomass or other effects. discontinuous inputs, such as the diurnal cycle or periodic dosing, can be included. solution method: the software solves for the temporal dynamics of particulates, solutes, and biofilm thickness, which are described by differential equations. these equations are discretized using a finite volume method and organized into a single system of ordinary differential equations that are solved using the differentialequations.jl library. the software includes a collection of postprocessing tools to assist the user with exploring the simulation results.
