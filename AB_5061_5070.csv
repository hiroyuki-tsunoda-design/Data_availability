"modelling the engaging behaviour of humans using multimodal data collected during human-robot interactions has attracted much research interest. most methods that have been proposed previously predict engaging behaviour directly from multimodal features, and do not incorporate personality inferences or any theories of interpersonal behaviour in human-human interactions. this work investigates whether personality inferences and attributes from interpersonal theories of behaviour (like attitude and emotion) further augment the modelling of engaging behaviour. we present a novel pipeline to model engaging behaviour that incorporates the big five personality traits, the interpersonal circumplex (ipc), and the triandis theory of interpersonal behaviour (tib). we extract first-person vision and physiological features from the mhhri dataset and predict the big five personality traits using a support vector machine. subsequently, we empirically validate the advantage of incorporating personality in modelling engaging behaviour and present a novel method that effectively uses the ipc to obtain scores for a human's attitude and emotion from their big five traits. finally, our results demonstrate that attitude and emotion are correlates of behaviour even in human-robot interactions, as suggested by the tib for human-human interactions. furthermore, incorporating the ipc and the big five traits helps generate behavioural inferences that supplement the engaging behaviour prediction, thus enriching the pipeline. engagement modelling has a wide range of applications in domains like online learning platforms, assistive robotics, and intelligent conversational agents. practitioners can also use this work in cognitive modelling and psychology to find more complex and subtle relations between humans' behaviour and personality traits, and discover new dynamics of the human psyche. the code will be made available at: https://github.com/soham-joshi/engagement-prediction-mhhri.",AB_0507
"mespeus is a freely accessible database which uses carefully selected metal coordination groups found in metalloprotein structures taken from the protein data bank. the database contains geometrical information of metal sites within proteins, including 40 metal types. in order to completely determine the metal coordination, the symmetry-related units of a given protein structure are taken into account and are generated using the appropriate space group symmetry operations. this permits a more complete description of the metal coordination geometry by including all coordinating atoms. the user-friendly web interface allows users to directly search for a metal site of interest using several useful options, including searching for metal elements, metal-donor distances, coordination number, donor residue group, and structural resolution. these searches can be carried out singly or in combination. the details of a metal site and the metal site(s) in the whole structure can be graphically displayed using the interactive web interface. mespeus is automatically updated monthly by synchronizing with the pdb database. an investigation for the mg-atp interaction is given to demonstrate how mespeus can be used to extract information about metal sites by selecting structure and coordination features. mespeus is available at http://mespeus.nchu.edu.tw/. graphical abstract",AB_0507
"the real-world facial expression recognition (fer) datasets suffer from noisy annotations due to crowd-sourcing, ambiguity in expressions, the subjectivity of annotators, and inter-class similarity. however, the recent deep networks have a strong capacity to memorize the noisy annotations leading to corrupted feature embedding and poor generalization. recent works handle the problem by selecting samples with clean labels based on loss values using a fixed threshold for all the classes which may not always be reliable. they also depend upon the noise rate in the data which may not always be available. in this work, we propose a novel fer framework (dnfer) in which samples with clean labels are selected based on a class-specific threshold, computed dynamically in each mini-batch. specifically, dnfer uses supervised training on selected clean samples and unsupervised consistent training on all the samples. this threshold is independent of noise rate and does not need any clean data, unlike other methods. in addition, to effectively learn from noisy annotated samples, the posterior distributions between weakly-augmented image and strongly-augmented image are aligned using an unsupervised consistency loss. we demonstrate the robustness of dnfer on both synthetic as well as on real noisy annotated fer datasets. in addition, dnfer obtains state-of-the-art performance on popular benchmark datasets, with 90.41% on rafdb, 57.77 % on sfew, 89.32% on ferplus, and 65.22% on affectnet-7. our source codes are made publicly available at https://github.com/1980x/dnfer.",AB_0507
"in this paper, we present our effort to develop an automatic speaker verification (asv) system for low resources children's data. for the children's speakers, very limited amount of speech data is available in majority of the languages for training the asv system. developing an asv system under low resource conditions is a very challenging problem. to develop the robust baseline system, we merged out of domain adults' data with children's data to train the asv system and tested with children's speech. this kind of system leads to acoustic mismatches between training and testing data. to overcome this issue, we have proposed spectral warping based data augmentation. we modified adult speech data using spectral warping method (to simulate like children's speech) and added it to the training data to overcome data scarcity and mismatch between adults' and children's speech. the proposed data augmentation gives 20.46% and 52.52% relative improvement (in equal error rate) for indian punjabi and british english speech databases, respectively. we compared our proposed method with well known data augmentation methods: specaugment, speed perturbation (sp) and vocal tract length perturbation (vtlp), and found that the proposed method performed best. the proposed spectral warping method is publicly available at https://github.com/kathania/speaker-verification-spectral-warping.",AB_0507
"purposeferrofluid seals are known for their low friction torque and high tightness. however, they have some limitation due to the allowable rotational speed. the work presented here analyzes the performance of newly designed seals which are a combination of a ferrofluid and a centrifugal seal. the new seals can operate at high speeds. the purpose of this study is to theoretically predict the performance of combined seals.design/methodology/approachthree seals were designed and selected for analysis. a version of the seals with a nonmagnetic insert is also considered, the purpose of which is to facilitate the installation and return of ferrofluid during low rotational speeds. the analyses were based on combining the results of numerical simulation of magnetic field distribution with mathematical models.findingsa combination of ferrofluid sealing and centrifugal sealing is possible. analyses showed that the combined seal could hold a minimum pressure of 190 kpa in the velocity range of 0-100 m/s. the problem with this type of seal is the temperature.originality/valuenew seal designs are presented. key parameters that affect the seal operation are discussed. a methodology that can be used in the design of such seals is presented.peer reviewthe peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/ilt-07-2023-0221/.",AB_0507
"though literacy levels are slowly improving in india due to the steps taken by the government of india, it has been a challenge for female students with gender disparities in literacy levels. stress levels are high in students, more so during their exam times. while prior literature has demonstrated the prevalence of stress during student life, there is limited evidence of any interventions to decrease stress and improve satisfaction with life, specifically for female students. heartfulness meditation is a heart-based meditation practice that may reduce stress and improve satisfaction with life among female students. we conducted a prospective cohort analysis comparing perceived stress and satisfaction with life outcomes among female students who self-selected to participate in the heartfulness meditation program. the first group, g20, underwent intervention from week 0 until week 12 and continued their practice independently until week 20. the second group, g14, joined the intervention from week 7 until week 12 with only a 6-week exposure to guided meditation sessions through heartfulness trainers. they continued their practice independently until week 20. data on perceived stress (pss) and satisfaction with life (swls) were collected at week 0 and week 20 for both groups. g20 had 127 participants, and g14 had 113 participants. ninety-four participants from the g20 group and 93 from g14 completed the study. the g20 group showed a statistically significant reduction of pss scores from 20.79 to 18.96, and an increase in the swls scores from 22.03 to 23.51 from baseline to the end of the study period. the study of the pearson correlation coefficient indicated that there is a weak positive correlation between pre- and post-scores for both the groups for both pss and swls. our findings suggest that heartfulness meditation practice offers significant benefits with perceived stress and satisfaction with life among female students independent of their age. still, a prolonged guided intervention of over 6 weeks is needed. a larger, randomized study with an additional control group with no meditation intervention is recommended.clinical trial registrationisrctn11302156, https://doi.org/10.1186/isrctn11302156.",AB_0507
"advancements in cancer immunotherapy have shown significant outcomes in treating cancers. to design effective immunotherapy, it's important to understand immune response of a patient based on its genomic profile. however, analyses to do that requires proficiency in the bioinformatic methods. swiftly growing sequencing technologies and statistical methods create a blockage for the scientists who want to find the biomarkers for different cancers but don't have detailed knowledge of coding or tool. here, we are providing a webbased resource that gives scientists with no bioinformatics expertise, the ability to obtain the prognostic biomarkers for different cancer types at different levels. we computed prognostic biomarkers from 8346 cancer patients for twenty cancer types. these biomarkers were computed based on i) presence of 352 human leukocyte antigen class-i, ii) 660959 tumor-specific hla1 neobinders, and iii) expression profile of 153 cytokines. it was observed that survival risk of cancer patients depends on presence of certain type of hla-i alleles; for example, liver hepatocellular carcinoma patients with hla-a*03:01 are at lower risk. our analysis indicates that neobinders of hla-i alleles have high correlation with overall survival of certain type of cancer patients. for example, hla-b*07:02 binders have 0.49 correlation with survival of lung squamous cell carcinoma and -0.77 with kidney chromophobe patients. additionally, we computed prognostic biomarkers based on cytokine expressions. higher expression of few cytokines is survival favorable like il-2 for bladder urothelial carcinoma, whereas il-5r is survival unfavorable for kidney chromophobe patients. freely accessible to public, cancerhla-i maintains raw and analysed data (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/cancerhla1/).",AB_0507
"background: kock's continent ileostomy is an option after proctocolectomy for patients not suitable for ipaa or ileorectal anastomosis. ulcerative colitis is the most common indication for continent ileostomy. objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of continent ileostomy. design: retrospective cohort register study. settings: data were obtained from the swedish national patient registry. patients: all patients with ibd and a continent ileostomy were identified. data on demographics, diagnosis, reoperations, and excisions of the continent ileostomy were obtained. patients with inconsistent diagnostic coding were classified as ibd-unclassified. main outcome measures: the main outcome measures were number of reoperations, time to reoperations, and time to excision of continent ileostomy. results: we identified 727 patients, 428 (59%) with ulcerative colitis, 45 (6%) with crohn's disease, and 254 (35%) with ibd-unclassified. after a median follow-up time of 27 (interquartile range, 21-31) years, 191 patients (26%) never had revision surgery. some 1484 reoperations were performed on 536 patients (74%), and the median number of reoperations was 1 (interquartile range, 0-3) per patient. the continent ileostomy was excised in 77 patients (11%). reoperation within the first year after reconstruction was associated with a higher rate of revisions (incidence rate ratio, 2.90; p < 0.001) and shorter time to excision (hr 2.38; p < 0.001). constructing the continent ileostomy after year 2000 was associated with increased revision and excision rates (incidence rate ratio, 2.7; p < 0.001 and hr 2.74; p = 0.013). ibd-unclassified was associated with increased revisions (incidence rate ratio, 1.3; p < 0.001), and the proportion of ibd-unclassified patients almost doubled from the 1980s (32%) to after 2000 (50%). limitations: retrospective design, data from a register, and no data on quality of life were available were the limitations of this study. conclusion: continent ileostomy is associated with substantial need for revision surgery, but most patients keep their reconstruction for a long time. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c122.",AB_0507
"the internet of medical things (iomt) is the new digital healthcare application paradigm that offers many healthcare services to users. iomt-based emerging healthcare applications such as cyborgs, the combination of advanced artificial intelligence (ai) robots, and doctors performing surgical operations remotely from hospitals to patients in their homes. for instance, robot-based knee replacement procedures, and thigh medical care real-time performance monitoring systems are cyborg applications. the paper introduces the multi-agent federated reinforcement learning policy (mfrlp) indicated in mobile and fog agents based on the socket remote procedure call (rpc) paradigm. the goal is to design a consumer-centric cyborg-efficient training testing system that executes the overall application mechanism with minimum delays in the iomt system. the study develops the rpc based on reinforcement learning and federated learning that adopts dynamic changes in the environment for cyborg applications. as a result, mfrlp minimized the training and testing in the mobile and fog environments by 50%, local processing time by 40%, and processing time by 50% compared to existing machine learning (ml) methods for cyborg applications. the code is publicly available at https://github.com/prayagtiwari/ciomt.",AB_0507
"mirnas (micrornas) target specific mrna (messenger rna) sites to regulate their translation expression. although mirna targeting can rely on seed region base pairing, animal mirnas, including human mirnas, typically cooperate with several cofactors, leading to various noncanonical pairing rules. therefore, identifying the binding sites of animal mirnas remains challenging. because experiments for mapping mirna targets are costly, computational methods are preferred for extracting potential mirna-mrna fragment binding pairs first. however, existing prediction tools can have significant false positives due to the prevalent noncanonical mirna binding behaviors and the information-biased training negative sets that were used while constructing these tools. to overcome these obstacles, we first prepared an information-balanced mirna binding pair ground-truth data set. a mirna-mrna interaction-aware model was then designed to help identify mirna binding events. on the test set, our model (auroc = 94.4%) outperformed existing models by at least 2.8% in auroc. furthermore, we showed that this model can suggest potential binding patterns for mirna-mrna sequence interacting pairs. finally, we made the prepared data sets and the designed model available at http://cosbi2.ee.ncku.edu.tw/mirna_binding/download.",AB_0507
