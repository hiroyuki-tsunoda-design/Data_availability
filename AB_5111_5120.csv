"motivation: gene set enrichment methods are a common tool to improve the interpretability of gene lists as obtained, for example, from differential gene expression analyses. they are based on computing whether dysregulated genes are located in certain biological pathways more often than expected by chance. gene set enrichment tools rely on pre-existing pathway databases such as kegg, reactome, or the gene ontology. these databases are increasing in size and in the number of redundancies between pathways, which complicates the statistical enrichment computation. results: we address this problem and develop a novel gene set enrichment method, called pareg, which is based on a regularized generalized linear model and directly incorporates dependencies between gene sets related to certain biological functions, for example, due to shared genes, in the enrichment computation. we show that pareg is more robust to noise than competing methods. additionally, we demonstrate the ability of our method to recover known pathways as well as to suggest novel treatment targets in an exploratory analysis using breast cancer samples from tcga. availability and implementation: pareg is freely available as an r package on bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pareg.html) as well as on https://github.com/cbg-ethz/pareg. the github repository also contains the snakemake workflows needed to reproduce all results presented here.",AB_0512
"recently, various methods for 6d pose and shape estimation of objects at a per-category level have been proposed. this work provides an overview of the field in terms of methods, datasets, and evaluation protocols. first, an overview of existing works and their commonalities and differences is provided. second, we take a critical look at the predominant evaluation protocol, including metrics and datasets. based on the findings, we propose a new set of metrics, contribute new annotations for the redwood dataset, and evaluate state-of-the-art methods in a fair comparison. the results indicate that existing methods do not generalize well to unconstrained orientations and are actually heavily biased towards objects being upright. we provide an easy-to-use evaluation toolbox with welldefined metrics, methods, and dataset interfaces, which allows evaluation and comparison with various state-of-the-art approaches (https://github.com/roym899/pose_and_shape_evaluation).(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0512
"isobaric labeling relative quantitation is one of the dominating proteomic quantitation technologies. traditional quantitation pipelines for isobaric-labeled mass spectrometry data are based on sequence database searching. in this study, we present a novel quantitation pipeline that integrates sequence database searching, spectral library searching, and a feature-based peptide-spectrum-match (psm) filter using various spectral features for filtering. the combined database and spectral library searching results in larger quantitation coverage, and the filter removes psms with larger quantitation errors, retaining those with higher quantitation accuracy. quantitation results show that the proposed pipeline can improve the overall quantitation accuracy at the psm and protein levels. to our knowledge, this is the first study that utilizes spectral library searching to improve isobaric labeling-based quantitation. for users to conveniently perform the proposed pipeline, we have implemented the feature-based filter being executable on both windows and linux platforms; its executable files, user manual, and sample data sets are freely available at https://ms.iis.sinica.edu.tw/comics/software_fpf.html. furthermore, with the developed filter, the proposed pipeline is fully compatible with the trans-proteomic pipeline.",AB_0512
"objective: to evaluate if an internet-delivered parent training program is noninferior to its group-delivered counterpart in reducing child disruptive behavior problems (dbp). method: this noninferiority randomized clinical trial enrolled families seeking treatment in primary care in stockholm, sweden, for dbp in a child 3-11 years of age. participants were randomized to internet-delivered (icomet) or group-delivered (gcomet) parent training. the primary outcome was parent-rated dbp. assessments were made at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. secondary outcomes included child and parent behaviors and well-being and treatment satisfaction. the noninferiority analysis was determined by a one-sided 95% ci of the mean difference between gcomet and icomet using multilevel modeling. results: this trial included 161 children (mean age 8.0); 102 (63%) were boys. in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, icomet was noninferior to gcomet. there were small differences in between-group effect sizes (d = -0.02 to 0.13) on the primary outcome with the upper limit of the one-sided 95% ci below the noninferiority margin at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. parents were more satisfied with gcomet (d = 0.49, 95% ci [0.26, 0.71]). at 3-month follow-up, there were also significant differences in treatment effect on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms (d = 0.34, 95% ci [0.07, 0.61]) and parenting behavior (d = 0.41, 95% ci [0.17, 0.65]) favoring gcomet. at 12-month follow-up, there were no dif-ferences in any outcomes. conclusion: internet-delivered parent training was noninferior to group-delivered parent training in reducing child dbp. the results were maintained at 12-month follow-up. this study supports internet-delivered parent training being used as an alternative to group-delivered parent training in clinical settings. clinical trial registration information: randomized controlled trial of comet via the internet or in group format; https://www.clinicaltrials. gov/; nct03465384.",AB_0512
"the identification and segmentation of histological regions of interest can provide significant support to pathologists in their diagnostic tasks. however, segmentation methods are constrained by the difficulty in obtaining pixel-level annotations, which are tedious and expensive to collect for whole-slide images (wsi). though several methods have been developed to exploit image-level weak-supervision for wsi classification, the task of segmentation using wsi-level labels has received very little attention. the research in this direction typically require additional supervision beyond image labels, which are difficult to obtain in real world practice. in this study, we propose wholesight, a weakly-supervised method that can simultaneously segment and classify wsis of arbitrary shapes and sizes. formally, wholesight first constructs a tissue-graph representation of wsi, where the nodes and edges depict tissue regions and their interactions, respectively. during training, a graph classification head classifies the wsi and produces node-level pseudo-labels via post-hoc feature attribution. these pseudo-labels are then used to train a node classification head for wsi segmentation. during testing, both heads simultaneously render segmentation and class prediction for an input wsi. we evaluate the performance of wholesight on three public prostate cancer wsi datasets. our method achieves state-of-the-art weakly-supervised segmentation performance on all datasets while resulting in better or comparable classification with respect to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised wsi classification methods. additionally, we assess the generalization capability of our method in terms of segmentation and classification performance, uncertainty estimation, and model calibration. our code is available at: https://github.com/histocartography/wholesight.",AB_0512
"quark spin effects in hadronization were recently included in the pythia 8 monte carlo event generator for the simulation of the deep inelastic scattering (dis) process off a polarized proton or neutron target. the spin effects were activated via the external stringspinner package, which is based on the string+(3) p(0 )model of polarized hadronization, and were restricted to the production of pseudoscalar mesons in string fragmentation. the struck quark polarization could either be calculated using parametrizations of the transversity pdfs or be freely specified. in this article we present a major extension of stringspinner that includes vector meson production in the pythia 8 string fragmentation. the spin-dependent emission and decay processes of the vector mesons are described using the string+(3) p-0 model, which systematically accounts for the quark-spin degree of freedom in the fragmentation chain. the new package works with the version 8.3 of the pythia event generator and it allows for a more complete and quantitative simulation of the final states in polarized semi-inclusive dis events. also, it can be used to study the transverse-spin effects for the production of vector mesons. after describing the new version of stringspinner, examples of its usage in semi-inclusive dis events are presented.new version program summaryprogram title: stringspinnercpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632/37jrpmyz3t .2developer's repository link: https://gitlab .com /albikerbizi /stringspinner.gitlicensing provisions: gnu gpl v2 or laterprogramming language: c++, fortranjournal reference of previous version: comput. phys. commun. 272 (2022) 108234.does the new version supersede the previous version?: yesreasons for the new version: vector meson emission and decay is required for a more complete simulation of the dis final states. summary of revisions: the spin-dependence of the string fragmentation is extended to include the production and the decay of polarized vector mesons.nature of problem: vector meson contribute strongly to the final hadrons produced in dis, and they can produce non-trivial effects on the spin-dependent observables.solution method: extend the previous version of stringspinner to include polarized vector meson production and decay using a more complete model of polarized hadronization.(c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0512
"an alarming number of fatalities caused by the covid-19 pandemic has forced the scientific community to accelerate the process of therapeutic drug discovery. in this regard, the collaboration between biomedical scientists and experts in artificial intelligence (ai) has led to a number of in silico tools being developed for the initial screening of therapeutic molecules. all living organisms produce antiviral peptides (avps) as a part of their first line of defense against invading viruses. the deepavpiden model proposed in this paper and its corresponding web app, deployed at https://deep-avpiden.anvil.app, is an effort toward discovering novel avps in proteomes of living organisms. apart from deep-avpiden, a computationally efficient model called deep-avpiden (ds) has also been developed using the same underlying network but with point-wise separable convolutions. the deep-avpiden and deep-avpiden (ds) models show an accuracy of 90% and 88%, respectively, and both have a precision of 90%. also, the proposed models were statistically compared using the student's t-test. on comparing the proposed models with the state-of-the-art classifiers, it was found that they are much better than them. to test the proposed model, we identified some avps in the natural defense proteins of plants, mammals, and fishes and found them to have appreciable sequence similarity with some experimentally validated antimicrobial peptides. these avps can be chemically synthesized and tested for their antiviral activity.",AB_0512
"tomato is one of the most extensively grown vegetables in any country, and their diseases can significantly affect yield and quality. accurate and early detection of tomato diseases is crucial for reducing losses and improving crop management. current deep learning and cnn research have resulted in the availability of multiple cnn designs, making automated plant disease identification viable rather than traditional visual inspection-based disease detection. when using deep learning methods, the dataset serves one of the most crucial roles in disease prediction. plantvillage is the most widely used publicly available dataset for tomato disease detection, but it was created in a laboratory/controlled environment, and models trained on it do not perform well on real-world images. some natural or real-world datasets are available, but they are private and not publicly available. also, when attempting to predict tomato diseases on the field in the jodhpur and jaipur districts of rajasthan, india, we found that the majority of diseases are leaf miner, spotted wilt virus, and nnutrition deficiency diseases, but there are no public datasets containing such categories. to overcome these challenges, we propose the creation of a new dataset called tomato-village with three variants: (a) multiclass tomato disease classification, (b) multilabel tomato disease classification, and (c) object detection-based tomato disease detection. to our best knowledge, tomato-village will be the first such dataset to be available publicly. further, we have applied the various cnn architectures/models on this dataset, and baseline results were drawn. the tomato-village dataset, their baseline results, and related source code will be available at https://github.com/mamta-joshi-gehlot/tomato-village.",AB_0512
"background: an accurate prediction of mortality in end-of-life care is crucial but presents challenges. existing prognostic tools demonstrate moderate performance in predicting survival across various time frames, primarily in in-hospital settings and single-time evaluations. however, these tools may fail to capture the individualized and diverse trajectories of patients. limited evidence exists regarding the use of artificial intelligence (ai) and wearable devices, specifically among patients with cancer at the end of life. objective: this study aimed to investigate the potential of using wearable devices and ai to predict death events among patients with cancer at the end of life. our hypothesis was that continuous monitoring through smartwatches can offer valuable insights into the progression of patients at the end of life and enable the prediction of changes in their condition, which could ultimately enhance personalized care, particularly in outpatient or home care settings. methods: this prospective study was conducted at the national taiwan university hospital. patients diagnosed with cancer and receiving end-of-life care were invited to enroll in wards, outpatient clinics, and home-based care settings. each participant was given a smartwatch to collect physiological data, including steps taken, heart rate, sleep time, and blood oxygen saturation. clinical assessments were conducted weekly. the participants were followed until the end of life or up to 52 weeks. with these input features, we evaluated the prediction performance of several machine learning-based classifiers and a deep neural network in 7-day death events. we used area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auroc), f1-score, accuracy, and specificity as evaluation metrics. a shapley additive explanations value analysis was performed to further explore the models with good performance. results: from september 2021 to august 2022, overall, 1657 data points were collected from 40 patients with a median survival time of 34 days, with the detection of 28 death events. among the proposed models, extreme gradient boost (xgboost) yielded the best result, with an auroc of 96%, f1-score of 78.5%, accuracy of 93%, and specificity of 97% on the testing set. the shapley additive explanations value analysis identified the average heart rate as the most important feature. other important features included steps taken, appetite, urination status, and clinical care phase. conclusions: we demonstrated the successful prediction of patient deaths within the next 7 days using a combination of wearable devices and ai. our findings highlight the potential of integrating ai and wearable technology into clinical end-of-life care, offering valuable insights and supporting clinical decision-making for personalized patient care. it is important to acknowledge that our study was conducted in a relatively small cohort; thus, further research is needed to validate our approach and assess its impact on clinical care.trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct05054907; https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct05054907",AB_0512
"deep learning models can achieve high accuracy when trained on large amounts of labeled data. however, real-world scenarios often involve several challenges: training data may become available in installments, may originate from multiple different domains, and may not contain labels for training. certain settings, for instance medical applications, often involve further restrictions that prohibit retention of previously seen data due to privacy regulations. in this work, to address such challenges, we study unsupervised segmentation in continual learning scenarios that involve domain shift. to that end, we introduce garda (generative appearance replay for continual domain adaptation), a generative-replay based approach that can adapt a segmentation model sequentially to new domains with unlabeled data. in contrast to single-step unsupervised domain adaptation (uda), continual adaptation to a sequence of domains enables leveraging and consolidation of information from multiple domains. unlike previous approaches in incremental uda, our method does not require access to previously seen data, making it applicable in many practical scenarios. we evaluate garda on three datasets with different organs and modalities, where it substantially outperforms existing techniques. our code is available at: https://github.com/histocartography/generative-appearance-replay.",AB_0512
