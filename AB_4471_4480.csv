"solubility is a property of central importance for the use of proteins in research in molecular and cell biology and in applications in biotechnology and medicine. since experimental methods for measuring protein solubility are material intensive and time consuming, computational methods have recently emerged to enable the rapid and inexpensive screening of solubility for large libraries of proteins, as it is routinely required in development pipelines. here, we describe the development of one such method to include in the predictions the effect of the ph on solubility. we illustrate the resulting ph-dependent predictions on a variety of antibodies and other proteins to demonstrate that these predictions achieve an accuracy comparable with that of experimental methods. we make this method publicly available at https://www-cohsoftware.ch.cam.ac.uk/index.php/camsolph, as the version 3.0 of camsol.",AB_0448
"text. let f be a totally real number field. dasgupta conjectured an explicit p-adic analytic formula for the gross- stark units of f. in a later paper, dasgupta-spiess conjectured a cohomological formula for the principal minors and the characteristic polynomial of the gross regulator matrix associated to a totally odd character of f. dasgupta-spiess conjectured that these conjectural formulas coincide for the diagonal entries of gross regulator matrix. in this paper, we prove this conjecture when f is a cubic field.video. for a video summary of this paper, please visit https://youtu .be /hlbruioke04.(c) 2023 the author. published by elsevier inc. this is an open access article under the cc by license ( .org /licenses /by /4 .0/).",AB_0448
"semantic segmentation is a popular technique successfully applied to various fields like self-driving cars, natural, medical, and satellite images, among others. on the one hand, a well-known concept of disagreement where two models help each other to learn better discriminative features comes from co-training. on the other hand, attention mechanisms are proven to improve the segmentation results; nevertheless, this technique solely focuses on signals with some kind of alignment. this research leverage both concepts in a new kind of attention based on disagreement (pure, embedded, and mixed-embedded disagreement attention) that improves the model generalisation. furthermore, we introduce an innovative deep supervision approach (alternating deep supervision) which trains the model following the sequence of supervision branches. extensive experiments over the segmentation benchmark datasets lits17 and ct-82 verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. the code is available at https://github.com/giussepi/disagreement-attention.",AB_0448
"the gene ontology (go) knowledgebase (http://geneontology.org) is a comprehensive resource concerning the functions of genes and gene products (proteins and noncoding rnas). go annotations cover genes from organisms across the tree of life as well as viruses, though most gene function knowledge currently derives from experiments carried out in a relatively small number of model organisms. here, we provide an updated overview of the go knowledgebase, as well as the efforts of the broad, international consortium of scientists that develops, maintains, and updates the go knowledgebase. the go knowledgebase consists of three components: (1) the go-a computational knowledge structure describing the functional characteristics of genes; (2) go annotations-evidence-supported statements asserting that a specific gene product has a particular functional characteristic; and (3) go causal activity models (go-cams)-mechanistic models of molecular pathways (go biological processes) created by linking multiple go annotations using defined relations. each of these components is continually expanded, revised, and updated in response to newly published discoveries and receives extensive qa checks, reviews, and user feedback. for each of these components, we provide a description of the current contents, recent developments to keep the knowledgebase up to date with new discoveries, and guidance on how users can best make use of the data that we provide. we conclude with future directions for the project.",AB_0448
"we introduce hi-cola, a code designed to run fast, approximate n-body sim-ulations of non-linear structure formation in reduced horndeski gravity. given an input lagrangian, hi-cola dynamically constructs the appropriate field equations and consistently solves for the cosmological background, linear growth, and screened fifth force of that theory. hence hi-cola is a general, adaptable, and useful tool that allows the mildly non-linear regime of many horndeski theories to be investigated for the first time, at low computational cost. in this work, we first describe the screening approximations and simulation setup of hi-cola for theories with vainshtein screening. we validate the code against traditional n-body simulations for cubic galileon gravity, finding 2.5% agreement up to kmax = 1.2 h/mpc. to demonstrate the flexibility of hi-cola, we additionally run the first simulations of an extended shift-symmetric gravity theory. we use the consistency and modularity of hi-cola to dissect how the modified background, linear growth, and screened fifth force all contribute to departures from acdm in the non-linear matter power spectrum. hi-cola can be found at https://github.com/hi-colacode/hi-cola.",AB_0448
"background & aims: it is unclear if dietary adjustments to maintain energy balance during reduced physical activity can offset inactivity-induced reductions in insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal to produce normal daily glucose concentrations and meal responses. therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of long-term physical inactivity (60 days of bed rest) on daily glycemia when in energy balance.methods: interstitial glucose concentrations were measured using continuous glucose monitoring sys-tems (cgms) for 5 days before and towards the end of bed rest in 20 healthy, young males (age: 34 +/- 8 years; bmi: 23.5 +/- 1.8 kg/m2). energy intake was reduced during bed rest to match energy expenditure, but the types of foods and timing of meals was maintained. fasting venous glucose and insulin con-centrations were determined, as well as the change in whole-body glucose disposal using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (hiec).results: following long-term bed rest, fasting plasma insulin concentration increased 40% (p = 0.004) and glucose disposal during the hiec decreased 24% (p < 0.001). interstitial daily glucose total area under the curve (tauc) from pre-to post-bed rest increased on average by 6% (p = 0.041), despite a 20 and 25% reduction in total caloric and carbohydrate intake, respectively. the nocturnal period (00:00-06:00) showed the greatest change to glycemia with glucose tauc for this period increasing by 9% (p = 0.005). cgms measures of daily glycemic variability (sd, j-index, m-value and mag) were not changed during bed rest.conclusions: reduced physical activity (bed rest) increases glycemia even when daily energy intake is reduced to maintain energy balance. however, the disturbance to daily glucose homeostasis was much more modest than the reduced capacity to dispose of glucose, and glycemic variability was not negatively affected by bed rest, likely due to positive mitigating effects from the contemporaneous reduction in dietary energy and carbohydrate intake. clinical trials record: nct03594799 (registered july 20, 2018) (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ nct03594799).(c) 2023 the authors. published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0448
"predicting the function of a protein from its amino acid sequence is a long- standing challenge in bioinformatics. traditional approaches use sequence alignment to compare a query sequence either to thousands of models of protein families or to large databases of individual protein sequences. here we introduce proteinfer, which instead employs deep convolutional neural networks to directly predict a variety of protein functions - enzyme commission (ec) numbers and gene ontology (go) terms - directly from an unaligned amino acid sequence. this approach provides precise predictions which complement alignment- based methods, and the computational efficiency of a single neural network permits novel and lightweight software interfaces, which we demonstrate with an in- browser graphical interface for protein function prediction in which all computation is performed on the user's personal computer with no data uploaded to remote servers. moreover, these models place full- length amino acid sequences into a generalised func-tional space, facilitating downstream analysis and interpretation. to read the interactive version of this paper, please visit https://google-research.github.io/proteinfer/.",AB_0448
"we present an open-source differentiable acoustic simulator, j-wave, which can solve time-varying and time-harmonic acoustic problems. it supports automatic differentiation, which is a program transformation technique that has many applications, especially in machine learning and scientific computing. j-wave is composed of modular components that can be easily customized and reused. at the same time, it is compatible with some of the most popular machine learning libraries, such as jax and tensorflow. the accuracy of the simulation results for known configurations is evaluated against the widely used k-wave toolbox and a cohort of acoustic simulation software. j-wave is available from https://github.com/ucl-bug/jwave.(c) 2023 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0448
"estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women have oxidative stress-mediated suppression of endothelial function that is exacerbated by high blood pressure. previous research suggests blueberries may improve endothelial function through reductions in oxidative stress, while also exerting other cardiovascular benefits. the objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of blueberries to improve endothelial function and blood pressure in postmenopausal women with above-normal blood pressure, and to identify potential mechanisms for improvements in endothelial function. a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm clinical trial was performed, where postmenopausal women aged 45-65 years with elevated blood pressure or stage 1-hypertension (total n = 43, endothelial function n = 32) consumed 22 g day(-1) of freeze-dried highbush blueberry powder or placebo powder for 12 weeks. endothelial function was assessed at baseline and 12 weeks through ultrasound measurement of brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (fmd) normalized to shear rate area under the curve (fmd/srauc) before and after intravenous infusion of a supraphysiologic dose of ascorbic acid to evaluate whether fmd improvements were mediated by reduced oxidative stress. hemodynamics, arterial stiffness, cardiometabolic blood biomarkers, and plasma (poly)phenol metabolites were assessed at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and venous endothelial cell protein expression was assessed at baseline and 12 weeks. absolute fmd/srauc was 96% higher following blueberry consumption compared to baseline (p < 0.05) but unchanged in the placebo group (p > 0.05), and changes from baseline to 12 weeks were greater in the blueberry group than placebo (+1.09 x 10(-4) +/- 4.12 x 10(-5)vs. +3.82 x 10(-6) +/- 1.59 x 10(-5), p < 0.03, respectively). the fmd/srauc response to ascorbic acid infusion was lower (p < 0.05) at 12 weeks compared to baseline in the blueberry group with no change in the placebo group (p > 0.05). the sum of plasma (poly)phenol metabolites increased at 4, 8, and 12 weeks in the blueberry group compared to baseline, and were higher than the placebo group (all p < 0.05). increases in several plasma flavonoid and microbial metabolites were also noted. no major differences were found for blood pressure, arterial stiffness, blood biomarkers, or endothelial cell protein expression following blueberry consumption. these findings suggest daily consumption of freeze-dried blueberry powder for 12 weeks improves endothelial function through reduced oxidative stress in postmenopausal women with above-normal blood pressure. the clinical trial registry number is nct03370991 (https://clinicaltrials.gov)",AB_0448
"recent fossil discoveries from new zealand have revealed a remarkably diverse assemblage of paleocene stem group penguins. here, we add to this growing record by describing nine new penguin specimens from the late paleocene (upper teurian local stage; 55.5-59.5 ma) moeraki formation of the south island, new zealand. the largest specimen is assigned to a new species, kumimanu fordycei n. sp., which may have been the largest penguin ever to have lived. allometric regressions based on humerus length and humerus proximal width of extant penguins yield mean estimates of a live body mass in the range of 148.0 kg (95% ci: 132.5 kg-165.3 kg) and 159.7 kg (95% ci: 142.6 kg-178.8 kg), respectively, for kumimanu fordycei. a second new species, petradyptes stonehousei n. gen. n. sp., is represented by five specimens and was slightly larger than the extant emperor penguin aptenodytes forsteri. two small humeri represent an additional smaller unnamed penguin species. parsimony and bayesian phylogenetic analyses recover kumimanu and petradyptes crownward of the early paleocene mainland nz taxa waimanu and muriwaimanu, but stemward of the chatham island taxon kupoupou. these analyses differ, however, in the placement of these two taxa relative to sequiwaimanu, crossvallia, and kaiika. the massive size and placement of kumimanu fordycei close to the root of the penguin tree provide additional support for a scenario in which penguins reached the upper limit of sphenisciform body size very early in their evolutionary history, while still retaining numerous plesiomorphic features of the flipper.uuid: https://zoobank.org/15b1d5b2-a5a0-4aa5-ba0a-8ef3b8461730",AB_0448
