"nemoh is developed to solve potential flow problems using the boundary element method for computing wave loads on offshore structures. the solver solves the first-order problem in the frequency domain. an extended module enables computation of the second-order loads on a structure in bi-chromatic bi-directional waves. nemoh is released as open-source, developed, and distributed under the terms of gnu general public license (gplv3). along with the source code, a user manual is available which facilitates the compilation and execution of the source files. in this new release, nemoh v3.0 has new features; irregular frequencies removal method, new linear system solvers for enhancing computational efficiency, and a new module for computing the full quadratic transfer function (qtf) of drift forces. verification cases are shown for a truncated cylinder, a truncated cylinder with a thin heave plate, a spar buoy platform (softwind), and a semi-submersible platform (oc4). the results are compared with reference data from commercial software, wamit, diodore, and hydrostar, and the comparison showed that nemoh v3.0 is accurate and efficient. program summary program title: nemoh cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /k9v4hjb5xj .1 developer's repository link: https://gitlab .com /lheea /nemoh code ocean capsule: https://codeocean .com /capsule /9256007 licensing provisions: gplv3 programming language: fortran external libraries and programs: blas [1], lapack [2] nature of problem: nemoh solves the potential flow problems of diffraction and radiation in wave-structure interactions. typical use is the estimation of the dynamic response of floating structures, e.g. floating offshore wind turbine platforms, or wave-energy converters. solution method: the linear potential flow problems, diffraction and radiation, are expressed in the boundary integral of the source distribution formulation. the equations are solved in the frequency domain and implemented using the boundary element method with quadrilateral panels. the source distribution on the body panels is obtained by solving the linear system. the hydrodynamic coefficients are computed with the known source distribution. the second-order potential flow problem is not solved directly; the green formulation is used with an assisting function which is the instantaneous radiation potential, that allows the computation of second-order force for given first-order hydrodynamic quantities. additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: & bull; the previous version, nemoh v2.0 [3], was available only for computing first-order hydrodynamic coefficients without the irregular frequency removal method. nemoh v3.0 has new features, the extended boundary integral method is implemented for removing the irregular frequencies, new computer physics (2023) linear system solvers are added for enhancing computational efficiency, and a new module is added for computing second-order wave loads. nemoh v3.0 has better accuracy than v2.0 due to finer interpolation points of the free-surface green function and a better integration method for constructing the influence coefficients. & bull; for the free-surface piercing bodies problem, it is known that non-unique solutions exist in the boundary integral equation at certain frequencies. in nemoh, the extended boundary integral equation is applied to remove the irregular frequencies by providing the lid panels on the body waterplane. the second-order loads require the computation of the free-surface forcing terms in the integral forms. these free-surface integrals are essential for the sum-frequency wave loads but may be negligible in the difference-frequency loads. for now, it is suggested not to apply the lid panels when the free-surface integrals are computed. references [1] https://netlib .org /blas/.

"recent deep-learning techniques have made it possible to manipulate facial expressions in digital photographs or videos, however, these techniques still lack fine and personalized ways to control their creation. moreover, current technologies are highly dependent on large labeled databases, which limits the range and complexity of expressions that can be modeled. thus, these technologies cannot deal with non-basic emotions. in this paper, we propose a novel interdisciplinary approach combining the generative adversarial network (gan) with a technique inspired by cognitive sciences, psychophysical reverse correlation. reverse correlation is a data-driven method able to extract an observer's 'mental representation' of what a given facial expression should look like. our approach can generate 1) personalized facial expression prototypes, 2) of basic emotions, and non-basic emotions that are not available in existing databases, and 3) without the need for expertise. personalized prototypes obtained with reverse correlation can then be applied to manipulate facial expressions. in addition, our system challenges the universality of facial expression prototypes by proposing the concepts of dominant and complementary action units to describe facial expression prototypes. the evaluations we conducted on a limited number of emotions validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. the code is available at https://github.com/yansen0508/mental-deep-reverse-engineering.",AB_0460
"change detection methods based on earth observations are increasingly used to monitor rainforest in the intertropical band. until recently, deforestation monitoring was mainly based on remotely sensed optical images which often face limitations in humid tropical areas due to frequent cloud coverage. this leads to late detections of disturbance events. since the launch of sentinel-1 acquiring images with a revisit time of 12 days and a spatial resolution of 5 x 20 m in brazil, synthetic aperture radar (sar) images have been increasingly used to monitor deforestation. in this study, we propose a multitemporal version of the change detection method we previously applied to timeseries of sentinel-1 sar images, to monitor deforestation/degradation in the congo rainforest. our approach is based on a cumulative sum (cusum) method combined with a spatial recombination of critical thresholds (cusum cross-tc). the newly developed multitemporal cusum method (recusum) was applied to a time-series of 82 dual polarization (vh, vv) ground range detected (grd) sentinel-1 images acquired in the para state, in the brazilian amazonia, from 29/09/2016 to 01/07/2019. the recusum method consists of iteratively applying the cusum cross-tc to monitor multiple changes in a time-series by splitting the time-series at each date of detected change and by independently iterating over the time periods resulting from the splits. the number of changes in the time-series was then analysed according to the vegetation type (forest, non-forest vegetation) determined by visual inspection of optical sentinel-2 image and planetscope monthly mosaic. this showed a difference between non-forest vegetation and forested areas. a threshold based on the number of changes (tnbc) was then developed to differentiate forest from non-forest disturbances. the ability to monitor non-forest vegetation was analysed: the cusum cross-tc detected up to 90% of the total non-forest vegetation area over the study region in the past period. after removing past disturbances and past non-forest vegetation, then removing the pixels covered with non-forest vegetations based on tnbc, the application of the recusum led to a precision of 81%, a recall of 68%, a kappa coefficient of 0.72 and a f1-score of 0.74 in forest disturbance monitoring. according to these results, recusum applied to sentinel-1 time-series of images can be used for efficient forest disturbance monitoring and for generating a forest / non-forest map after the application of newly developed post-processing steps. sentinel-1 imagery can be used for both forest / non-forest mapping and for forest disturbance detection. recusum was released as an open-source git project available at: https://forgemia. inra.fr/bertrand.ygorra/cusum-deforestation_monitoring.",AB_0460
"ph determination and acid-base titrations areessentialexperiments performed by high school and university undergraduatestudents alike throughout their chemistry education. while these experimentsoften rely on conventional ph meters for quantification and ph teststrips or indicators for qualitative assessments, we demonstratedherein that a smartphone-based ph determination technique, performingdigital image analysis, particularly the determination of either thedominant wavelength or the rgb intensities, could readily replaceall but one conventional ph meter in a classroom setting. using anin-house developed smartphone-based ph reading application (app),students were able to determine the ph and perform titrations usingph strips and universal indicators, producing results matching thosedetermined with a standard ph meter. the app and its variantsare available for download (https://tinyurl.com/2dashjyk and https://tinyurl.com/4d73wnxt), and no prior knowledge of coding or programing was required fromthe students. all that was needed was an android 11 phone or tabletwith an internet connection. moreover, the students and instructors'reactions to the mobile app alike were very positive and showcasedthe need and interest for such inexpensive technology, which allowsfor the running of an entire class for ph determination of multiplereal-life samples or acid/base titration without using standard phmeters.",AB_0460
"introduction: indigenous peoples in canada face a disproportionate burden of diabetes-related foot complications (drfc), such as foot ulcers, lower extremity amputations (lea), and peripheral arterial disease. this scoping review aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of drfc among first nations, me ' tis, and inuit peoples in canada, incorporating an equity lens. methods: a scoping review was conducted based on arksey ando'malley refined by the joanna briggs institute. the progress-plus framework was utilized to extract data and incorporate an equity lens. a critical appraisal was performed, and indigenous stakeholders were consulted for feedback. we identified the incorporation of patient-oriented/centered research (por). results: of 5,323 records identified, 40 studies were included in the review. the majority of studies focused on first nations (92%), while representation of the inuit population was very limited populations (< 3% of studies). lea was the most studied outcome (76%). age, gender, ethnicity, and place of residence were the most commonly included variables. patient-oriented/centered research was mainly included in recent studies (16%). the overall quality of the studies was average. data synthesis showed a high burden of drfc among indigenous populations compared to non-indigenous populations. indigenous identity and rural/remote communities were associated with the worse outcomes, particularly major lea. discussion: this study provides a comprehensive understanding of drfc in indigenous peoples in canada of published studies in database. it not only incorporates an equity lens and patient-oriented/centered research but also demonstrates that we need to change our approach. more data is needed to fully understand the burden of drfc among indigenous peoples, particularly in the northern region in canada where no data are previously available. western research methods are insufficient to understand the unique situation of indigenous peoples and it is essential to promote culturally safe and quality healthcare. conclusion: efforts have been made to manage drfc, but continued attention and support are necessary to address this population's needs and ensure equitable prevention, access and care that embraces their ways of knowing, being and acting. systematic review registration: open science framework https://osf.io/j9pu7, identifier j9pu7.",AB_0460
"background rifampin-resistant tuberculosis is a leading cause of morbidity worldwide; only one-third of persons start treatment, and outcomes are often inadequate. several trials demonstrate 90% efficacy using an all-oral, 6-month regimen of bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid (bpal), but significant toxicity occurred using 1200-mg linezolid. after us food and drug administration approval in 2019, some us clinicians rapidly implemented bpal using an initial 600-mg linezolid dose adjusted by serum drug concentrations and clinical monitoring.methods data from us patients treated with bpal between 14 october 2019 and 30 april 2022 were compiled and analyzed by the bpal implementation group (big), including baseline examination and laboratory, electrocardiographic, and clinical monitoring throughout treatment and follow-up. linezolid dosing and clinical management was provider driven, and most patients had linezolid adjusted by therapeutic drug monitoring.results of 70 patients starting bpal, 2 changed to rifampin-based therapy, 68 (97.1%) completed bpal, and 2 of the 68 (2.9%) experienced relapse after completion. using an initial 600-mg linezolid dose daily adjusted by therapeutic drug monitoring and careful clinical and laboratory monitoring for adverse effects, supportive care, and expert consultation throughout bpal treatment, 3 patients (4.4%) with hematologic toxicity and 4 (5.9%) with neurotoxicity required a change in linezolid dose or frequency. the median bpal duration was 6 months.conclusions bpal has transformed treatment for rifampin-resistant or intolerant tuberculosis. in this cohort, effective treatment required less than half the duration recommended in 2019 us guidelines for drug-resistant tuberculosis. use of individualized linezolid dosing and monitoring likely enhanced safety and treatment completion. the big cohort demonstrates that early implementation of new tuberculosis treatments in the united states is feasible. an all-oral 6-month regimen of bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid (bpal) was implemented in the united states to treat rifampin-resistant and rifampin-intolerant tuberculosis. all patients safely completed treatment using close monitoring, linezolid serum drug levels, and early management of adverse events. graphical abstract this graphical abstract is also available at tidbit: https://tidbitapp.io/tidbits/implementation-of-bpal-in-the-united-states-experience-using-a-novel-all-oral-treatment-regimen-for-treatment-of-rifampin-resistant-or-rifampin-intolerant-tb-disease-dee64faf-9909-4a26-ac3a-bf8078a7a4a3",AB_0460
"many important engineering optimization problems require a strong and simple optimization algorithm to achieve the best solutions. in 2020, rao introduced three non-parametric algorithms, known as rao algorithms, which have garnered significant attention from researchers worldwide due to their simplicity and effectiveness in solving optimization problems. in our simulation studies, we have developed a new version of the rao algorithm called the fully informed search algorithm (fisa), which demonstrates acceptable performance in optimizing real-world problems while maintaining the simplicity and non-parametric nature of the original algorithms. we evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested fisa approach by applying it to optimize the shifted benchmark functions, such as those provided in cec 2005 and cec 2014, and by using it to design mechanical system components. we compare the results of fisa to those obtained using the original rao method. the outcomes obtained indicate the efficacy of the proposed new algorithm, fisa, in achieving optimized solutions for the aforementioned problems. the matlab codes of fisa are publicly available at https://github.com/ebrahimakbary/fisa.",AB_0460
"itis well-known that the activity and function of proteinsisstrictly correlated with their secondary, tertiary, and quaternarystructures. their biological role is regulated by their conformationalflexibility and global fold, which, in turn, is largely governed bycomplex noncovalent interaction networks. because of the large sizeof proteins, the analysis of their noncovalent interaction networksis challenging, but can provide insights into the energetics of conformationalchanges or protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions.the noncovalent interaction (nci) index, based on the reduced densitygradient, is a well-established tool for the detection of weak contactsin biological systems. in this work, we present a web-based applicationto expand the use of this index to proteins, which only requires amolecular structure as input and provides a mapping of the number,type, and strength of noncovalent interactions. structure preparationis automated and allows direct importing from the pdb database, makingthis server (https://nciweb.dsi.upmc.fr) accessible to scientists with limited experience in bioinformatics.a quick overview of this tool and concise instructions are presented,together with an illustrative application.",AB_0460
"motivation: in the field of oncology, statistical models are used for the discovery of candidate factors that influence the development of the pathology or its outcome. these statistical models can be designed in a multiblock framework to study the relationship between different multiomic data, and variable selection is often achieved by imposing constraints on the model parameters. a priori graph constraints have been used in the literature as a way to improve feature selection in the model, yielding more interpretability. however, it is still unclear how these graphs interact with the models and how they impact the feature selection. additionally, with the availability of different graphs encoding different information, one can wonder how the choice of the graph meaningfully impacts the results obtained. results: we proposed to study the graph penalty impact on a multiblock model. specifically, we used the sgcca as the multiblock framework. we studied the effect of the penalty on the model using the tcga-lgg dataset. our findings are 3-fold. we showed that the graph penalty increases the number of selected genes from this dataset, while selecting genes already identified in other works as pertinent biomarkers in the pathology. we demonstrated that using different graphs leads to different though consistent results, but that graph density is the main factor influencing the obtained results. finally, we showed that the graph penalty increases the performance of the survival prediction from the model-derived components and the interpretability of the results. availability and implementation: source code is freely available at https://github.com/neurospin/netsgcca",AB_0460
"motivation: alignment of protein structures is a major problem in structural biology. the first approach commonly used is to consider proteins as rigid bodies. however, alignment of protein structures can be very complex due to conformational variability, or complex evolutionary relationships between proteins such as insertions, circular permutations or repetitions. in such cases, introducing flexibility becomes useful for two reasons: (i) it can help compare two protein chains which adopted two different conformational states, such as due to proteins/ligands interaction or post-translational modifications, and (ii) it aids in the identification of conserved regions in proteins that may have distant evolutionary relationships. results: we propose icarus, a new approach for flexible structural alignment based on identification of protein units, evolutionarily preserved structural descriptors of intermediate size, between secondary structures and domains. icarus significantly outperforms reference methods on a dataset of very difficult structural alignments. availability and implementation: code is freely available online at https://github.com/dsimb/icarus.",AB_0460
