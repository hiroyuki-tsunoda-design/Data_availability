"wearable cameras allow to acquire images and videos from the user's perspective. these data can be processed to understand humans behavior. despite human behavior analysis has been thoroughly investigated in third person vision, it is still understudied in egocentric settings and in particular in industrial scenarios. to encourage research in this field, we present meccano, a multimodal dataset of egocentric videos to study humans behavior understanding in industrial-like settings. the multimodality is characterized by the presence of gaze signals, depth maps and rgb videos acquired simultaneously with a custom headset. the dataset has been explicitly labeled for fundamental tasks in the context of human behavior understanding from a first person view, such as recognizing and anticipating human-object interactions. with the meccano dataset, we explored six different tasks including (1) action recognition, (2) active objects detection and recognition, (3) egocentric human-objects interaction detection, (4) egocentric gaze estimation, (5) action anticipation and (6) next-active objects detection. we propose a benchmark aimed to study human behavior in the considered industrial-like scenario which demonstrates that the investigated tasks and the considered scenario are challenging for state-of-the-art algorithms. to support research in this field, we publicy release the dataset at https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/meccano/.",AB_0548
"with the progression of the covid-19 pandemic, large datasets of sars-cov-2 genome sequences were collected to closely monitor the evolution of the virus and identify the novel variants/strains. by analyzing genome sequencing data, health authorities can 'hunt' novel emerging variants of sars-cov-2 as early as possible, and then monitor their evolution and spread. we designed varianthunter, a highly flexible and user-friendly tool for systematically monitoring the evolution of sars-cov-2 at global and regional levels. in varianthunter, amino acid changes are analyzed over an interval of 4 weeks in an arbitrary geographical area (continent, country, or region); for every week in the interval, the prevalence is computed and changes are ranked based on their increase or decrease in prevalence. varianthunter supports two main types of analysis: lineage-independent and lineage-specific. the former considers all the available data and aims to discover new viral variants. the latter evaluates specific lineages/viral variants to identify novel candidate designations (sub-lineages and sub-variants). both analyses use simple statistics and visual representations (diffusion charts and heatmaps) to track viral evolution. a dataset explorer allows users to visualize available data and refine their selection. varianthunter is a web application free to all users. the two types of supported analysis (lineage-independent and lineage-specific) allow user-friendly monitoring of the viral evolution, empowering genomic surveillance without requiring any computational background.database url: http://gmql.eu/variant_hunter/",AB_0548
"alvabuilder is a software tool for de novo moleculardesign andcan be used to generate novel molecules having desirable characteristics.such characteristics can be defined using a simple step by step graphicalinterface, and they can be based on molecular descriptors, on predictionsof qsar/qspr models, and on matching molecular fragments or used todesign compounds similar to a given one. the molecules generated arealways syntactically valid since they are composed by combining fragmentsof molecules taken from a training data set chosen by the user. inthis paper, we demonstrate how the software can be used to designnew compounds for a defined case study. alvabuilder is available at https://www.alvascience.com/alvabuilder/",AB_0548
"background: the beneficial effect of a defunctioning stoma in mitigating the consequences of anastomotic leakage after rectal cancer surgery is still debated. objective: this study aims to reflect on a decade of rectal cancer surgery in terms of stoma construction and anastomotic leakage. design: retrospective observational study. setting: this study used data from the dutch colorectal audit from 2011 to 2020. patients: patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery with a primary anastomosis. main outcome measures: primary outcome was anastomotic leakage. secondary outcomes were minor complications, admission to intensive care, length of stay, readmission, and patient death. results: a total of 13,263 patients were included in this study. a defunctioning stoma was constructed in 7106 patients (53.6%). patients with a defunctioning stoma were less likely to develop anastomotic leakage (7.9% vs 13.0%), and if anastomotic leakage occurred, fewer patients needed surgical reintervention (37.7% vs 81.1%). an annual decrease in the construction of a defunctioning stoma was seen (69.8% in 2011 vs 51.8% in 2015 vs 29.7% in 2020), accompanied by a 5% increase in anastomotic leakage (9.1% in 2011 vs 14.1% in 2020). a defunctioning stoma was associated with a higher occurrence of minor complications, increased admissions to the intensive care unit, longer length of stay, and more readmissions within 90 days. limitation: this retrospective study is susceptible to confounders by indications, and there could be risk factors for anastomotic leakage and the use of a stoma that were not regarded. conclusions: the reduction in defunctioning stomas is paralleled with an increase in anastomotic leakage. however, patients with a defunctioning stoma also showed more minor complications, a prolonged length of stay, more intensive care admissions, and more readmissions. in our opinion, the trade-offs of selective use should be individually considered. see video abstract at http://links.lww. com/dcr/c137.",AB_0548
"background: :accurate clinical restaging is required to select patients who respond to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer and who may benefit from an organ preservation strategy. objective:the purpose of this study was to review our experience with the clinical restaging of rectal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy to assess its accuracy in detecting major and pathological complete response to treatment. design:this was a retrospective cohort study. setting:this study was conducted at 2 high-volume italian centers for colorectal surgery. patients:data were included from all consecutive patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy and surgery for locally advanced rectal cancer from january 2012 to july 2020. criteria to define clinical response were no palpable mass, a superficial ulcer <2 cm (major response), or no mucosal abnormality (complete response) at endoscopy and no metastatic nodes at mri. main outcome measures:the main outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values of clinical restaging in detecting pathological complete response (ypt0) or major pathological response (ypt0-1) after neoadjuvant therapy. results:a total of 333 patients were included; 81 (24.3%) had a complete response whereas 115 (34.5%) had a pathological major response. accuracy for clinical complete response was 80.8% and for major clinical response was 72.9%. sensitivity was low for both clinical complete response (37.5%) in detecting ypt0 and clinical major response (59.3%) in detecting ypt0-1. positive predictive value was 68.2% for ypt0 and 60.4% for ypt0-1. limitations:the main limitation of the study its retrospective nature. conclusion:accuracy of actual clinical criteria to define pathological complete response or pathological major response is poor. failure to achieve good sensitivity and precision is a major limiting factor in the clinical setting. current clinical assessments need to be revised to account for indications for rectal preservation after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c63.",AB_0548
"molecular adsorption is the first important step of many surface-mediated chemical processes, from catalysis to lubrication. this phenomenon is controlled by physical/chemical interactions, which can be accurately described by first-principles calculations. several computational tools have been developed to study molecular adsorption based on high throughput/automatized approaches in recent years. however, these tools can sometimes be over-sophisticated for non-expert users. here we present xsorb, a pythonbased program for identifying the accurate adsorption energy and geometry of complex molecules on crystalline (reconstructed) surfaces. the program automatically samples the potential energy surface (pes) that describes the molecule-surface interaction by generating several adsorption configurations through symmetry operations. the set of the most representative ones is automatically identified through a fast pre-optimization scheme. finally, the pes global minimum is identified through a full structural optimization process. we show the program capabilities through an example consisting of a hydrocarbon molecule, 1-hexene, adsorbed over the (110) surface of iron and the reconstructed (001) surface of diamond. this program, despite its conceptual simplicity, is very effective in reducing the computational workload usually associated with the creation and optimization of several adsorption configurations. program summaryprogram title: xsorb cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /kv97tgybx8 .1developer's repository link: https://gitlab .com /triboteam /xsorbed/ licensing provisions: cc by 4.0programming language: python (version 3.7 and above) and quantum espresso (for the ab initio calculations).nature of problem: identifying the most stable adsorption configuration of a molecule over a substrate and compute its adsorption energy.solution method: creating a python-based code that generates many adsorption configurations with different molecular orientations, performs a preliminary partial geometrical optimization with density functional theory calculations of all these configurations, identifies the most relevant ones for the full geometrical optimization and computes the adsorption energy.& copy; 2023 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ( .org /licenses /by /4 .0/).",AB_0548
"plankton microorganisms play a huge role in the aquatic food web. recently, it has been proposed to use plankton as a biosensor, since they can react to even minimal perturbations of the aquatic environment with specific physiological changes, which may lead to alterations in morphology and behavior. nowadays, the development of high-resolution in-situ automatic acquisition systems allows the research community to obtain a large amount of plankton image data. fundamental examples are the zooscan and woods hole oceanographic institution (whoi) datasets, comprising up to millions of plankton images. however, obtaining unbiased annotations is expensive both in terms of time and resources, and in-situ acquired datasets generally suffer from severe imbalance, with only a few images available for several species. transfer learning is a popular solution to these challenges, with imagenet1k being the most-used source dataset for pre-training. on the other hand, datasets like the zooscan and the whoi may represent a valuable opportunity to compare out-of-domain and large-scale plankton in-domain source datasets, in terms of performance for the task at hand.in this paper, we design three transfer learning pipelines for plankton image classification, with the aim of comparing in-domain and out-of-domain transfer learning on three popular benchmark plankton datasets. the general framework consists in fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a plankton target dataset. in the first pipeline, the model is pre-trained from scratch on a large-scale plankton dataset, in the second, it is pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets (imagenet1k or imagenet22k), while in the third, a two-stage fine-tuning is implemented (imagenet -> large-scale plankton dataset -> target plankton dataset). our results show that an out-of-domain imagenet22k pre-training outperforms the plankton in-domain ones, with an average boost in test accuracy of around 6%. in the next part of this work, we adopt three imagenet22k pre-trained vision transformers and one convnext, obtaining results on par (or slightly superior) with the state-of-the-art, corresponding to the usage of cnn models ensembles, with a single model. finally, we design and test an ensemble of our vision transformers and the convnext, outperforming the state-of-the-art existing works on plankton image classification on the three target datasets. to support scientific community contribution and further research, our implemented code is open-source and available at https://github.com/malga-vision/plankton_transfer.",AB_0548

"g protein coupled receptors (gpcrs) are critical eukaryotic signal transduction gatekeepers and repre-sent the largest protein superfamily in the human proteome, with more than 800 members. they share seven transmembrane helices organized in an up-down bundle architecture. gpcr-mediated signaling pathways have been linked to numerous human diseases, and gpcrs are the targets of approximately 35% of all drugs currently on the market. structure network analysis, a graph theory-based approach, represents a cutting-edge tool to deeply understand gpcr function, which strongly relies on communica-tion between the extracellular and intracellular poles of their structure. psngpcrdb stores the structure networks (i.e., linked nodes, hubs, communities and communication pathways) computed on all updated gpcr structures in the protein data bank, in their isolated states or in complex with extracellular and/or intracellular molecules. the structure communication signatures of a sub-family or family of gpcrs as well as of their small-molecule activators or inhibitors are stored as consensus networks. the database stores also all meaningful structure network-based comparisons (i.e., difference networks) of functionally different states (i.e., inactive or active) of a given receptor sub-type, or of consensus networks represen-tative of a receptor sub-type, type, sub-family or family. single or consensus gpcr networks hold also information on amino acid conservation. the database allows to graphically analyze 3d structure net-works together with interactive data-tables. ligand-centric networks can be analyzed as well. psngpcrdb is unique and represents a powerful resource to unravel gpcr function with important impli-cations in cell signaling and drug design. psngpcrdb is freely available at: http://webpsn.hpc.unimo.it/ psngpcr.php.& copy; 2023 the authors. published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0548
