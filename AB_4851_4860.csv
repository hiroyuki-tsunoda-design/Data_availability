"we present a global multiyear height-resolved data set of aerosol-type-specific cloud condensation nuclei concentrations (n(ccn)) estimated from the spaceborne lidar aboard the cloud-aerosol lidar and infrared pathfinder satellite observation (calipso) satellite. for estimating nccn, we apply the recently introduced optical modelling of the calipso aerosol microphysics (omcam) algorithm to the calipso level 2 aerosol profile product. the estimated n(ccn) are then gridded into a uniform latitude-longitude grid of 2 degrees x 5 degrees, a vertical grid of resolution 60m from the surface to an altitude of 8 km, and a temporal resolution of 1 month. the data span a total of 186 months, from june 2006 to december 2021. in addition, we provide a 3d aerosoltype-specific climatology of n(ccn) produced using the complete time series. we further highlight some potential applications of the data set in the context of aerosol-cloud interactions. the complete data set can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.1594/pangaea.956215 (choudhury and tesche, 2023).",AB_0486
"the number of publications describing chemical structures has increased steadily over the last decades. however, the majority of published chemical information is currently not available in machine-readable form in public databases. it remains a challenge to automate the process of information extraction in a way that requires less manual intervention - especially the mining of chemical structure depictions. as an open-source platform that leverages recent advancements in deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing, decimer.ai (deep learning for chemical image recognition) strives to automatically segment, classify, and translate chemical structure depictions from the printed literature. the segmentation and classification tools are the only openly available packages of their kind, and the optical chemical structure recognition (ocsr) core application yields outstanding performance on all benchmark datasets. the source code, the trained models and the datasets developed in this work have been published under permissive licences. an instance of the decimer web application is available at https://decimer.ai.",AB_0486
"in the last decade, a number of methods have been suggested to deal with large amounts of genetic data in genomic predictions. yet, steadily growing population sizes and the suboptimal use of computational resources are pushing the practical application of these approaches to their limits. as an extension to the c/cuda library miraculix, we have developed tailored solutions for the computation of genotype matrix multiplications which is a critical bottleneck in the empirical evaluation of many statistical models. we demonstrate the benefits of our solutions at the example of single-step models which make repeated use of this kind of multiplication. targeting modern nvidia((r)) gpus as well as a broad range of cpu architectures, our implementation significantly reduces the time required for the estimation of breeding values in large population sizes. miraculix is released under the apache 2.0 license and is freely available at https://github.com/alexfreudenberg/miraculix.",AB_0486
"oxford nanopore technologies' (ont) sequencing platform offers an excellent opportunity to perform real-time analysis during sequencing. this feature allows for early insights into experimental data and accelerates a potential decision-making process for further analysis, which can be particularly relevant in the clinical context. although some tools for the real-time analysis of dna-sequencing data already exist, there is currently no application available for differential transcriptome data analysis designed for scientists or physicians with limited bioinformatics knowledge. here, we introduce nanoporeata, a user-friendly real-time analysis toolbox for rna-sequencing data from ont. sequencing results from a running or finished experiment are processed through an r shiny-based graphical user interface with an integrated nextflow pipeline for whole transcriptome or gene-specific analyses. nanoporeata provides visual snapshots of a sequencing run in progress, thus enabling interactive sequencing and rapid decision making that could also be applied to clinical cases. availability and implementation: github https://github.com/anwiercze/nanoporeata; zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8099825.",AB_0486
"we present nu dobe, a python tool for the computation of neutrinoless double beta decay (0 nu beta beta) rates in terms of lepton-number-violating operators in the standard model effective field theory (smeft). the tool can be used for automated calculations of 0 nu beta beta rates, electron spectra and angular correlations for all isotopes of experimental interest, for lepton-number-violating operators up to and including dimension 9. the tool takes care of renormalization-group running to lower energies and provides the matching to the low-energy effective field theory and, at lower scales, to a chiral effective field theory description of 0 nu beta beta rates. the user can specify different sets of nuclear matrix elements from various many-body methods and hadronic low-energy constants. the tool can be used to quickly generate analytical and numerical expressions for 0 nu beta beta rates and to generate a large variety of plots. in this work, we provide examples of possible use along with a detailed code documentation. the code can be accessed through:github: https://github.com/oscholer/nudobeonline user-interface: https://oscholer-nudobe-streamlit-4foz22.streamlit.app/",AB_0486
"e3 ligases are enzymes that play a critical role in ubiquitin-mediatedprotein degradation and are involved in various cellular processes.pharmacophore analysis is a useful approach for predicting e3 ligasebinding selectivity, which involves identifying key chemical featuresnecessary for a ligand to interact with a specific protein targetcavity. while pharmacophore analysis is not always sufficient to accuratelypredict ligand binding affinity, it can be a valuable tool for filteringand/or designing focused libraries for screening campaigns. in thisstudy, we present a fast and an inexpensive approach using a pharmacophorefingerprinting scheme known as erg, which is used in a multi-classmachine learning classification model. this model can assign the correcte3 ligase binder to its known e3 ligase and predict the probabilityof each molecule to bind to different e3 ligases. practical applicationsof this approach are demonstrated on commercial libraries such asasinex for the rational design of e3 ligase binders. the scripts anddata associated with this study can be found on github at https://github.com/fraunhofer-itmp/e3_binder_model.",AB_0486
"in population medical genetics, the study of autosomal recessive disorders in highly endogamous populations is a major topic where calculating the inbreeding and relationship coefficients on mating networks is crucial. however, a challenge arises when dealing with large and complex mating networks, making their traversal difficult during the calculation process. for this calculation, we propose using iterative level-0 (il0) as a new and faster algorithm that traverses mating networks more efficiently. the purpose of this work is to explain in detail the il0 algorithm and prove its superiority by comparing it with two algorithms based on the best-known algorithms in the area: depth first search (dfs) and breadth first search (bfs). a cytoscape application has been developed to calculate the inbreeding and relationship coefficients of individuals composing any mating network. in this application, the il0 proposal together with dfs-based and bfs-based algorithms have been implemented. any user can access this freely available cytoscape application (https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/ inbreeding) that allows the comparison between the il0 proposal and the best-known algorithms (based on dfs and bfs). in addition, a diverse set of mating networks has been collected in terms of complexity (number of edges) and species (humans, primates, and dogs) for the experiments. the runtime obtained by the il0, dfs-based, and bfs-based algorithms when calculating the inbreeding and relationship coefficients proved the improvement of il0. in fact, a speedup study reflected that the il0 algorithm is 7.60 to 127.50 times faster than dfs-based and bfs-based algorithms. moreover, a scalability study found that the growth of the il0 runtime has a linear dependence on the number of edges of the mating network, while the dfs-based and bfs-based runtimes have a quadratic dependence. therefore, the il0 algorithm can solve the problem of calculating the inbreeding and relationship coefficients many times faster (up to 127.50) than the two algorithms based on the famous dfs and bfs. furthermore, our results demonstrate that il0 scales much better as the complexity of mating networks increases.",AB_0486

"the field of deep visual analytics (dva) has recently arisen from the idea of developing visual interactive systems supported by deep learning, in order to provide them with large-scale data processing capabilities and to unify their implementation across different data and domains. in this paper we present deepvats, an open-source tool that brings the field of dva into time series data. deepvats trains, in a self-supervised way, a masked time series autoencoder that reconstructs patches of a time series, and projects the knowledge contained in the embeddings of that model in an interactive plot, from which time series patterns and anomalies emerge and can be easily spotted. the tool includes a back-end for data processing pipeline and model training, as well as a front-end with an interactive user interface. we report on results that validate the utility of deepvats, running experiments on both synthetic and real datasets. the code is publicly available on https://github.com/vrodriguezf/deepvats.(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0486
"the nasa aerosol cloud meteorology interactions over the western atlantic experiment (activate) produced a unique dataset for research into aerosol-cloud-meteorology interactions, with applications extending from process-based studies to multi-scale model intercomparison and improvement as well as to remote-sensing algorithm assessments and advancements. activate used two nasa langley research center aircraft, a hu-25 falcon and king air, to conduct systematic and spatially coordinated flights over the northwest atlantic ocean, resulting in 162 joint flights and 17 other single-aircraft flights between 2020 and 2022 across all seasons. data cover 574 and 592 cumulative flights hours for the hu-25 falcon and king air, respectively. the hu-25 falcon conducted profiling at different level legs below, in, and just above boundary layer clouds (< 3 km) and obtained in situ measurements of trace gases, aerosol particles, clouds, and atmospheric state parameters. under cloud-free conditions, the hu-25 falcon similarly conducted profiling at different level legs within and immediately above the boundary layer. the king air (the high-flying aircraft) flew at approximately similar to 9 km and conducted remote sensing with a lidar and polarimeter while also launching dropsondes (785 in total). collectively, simultaneous data from both aircraft help to characterize the same vertical column of the atmosphere. in addition to individual instrument files, data from the hu-25 falcon aircraft are combined into merge files on the publicly available data archive that are created at different time resolutions of interest (e.g., 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 s, or matching an individual data product's start and stop times). this paper describes the activate flight strategy, instrument and complementary dataset products, data access and usage details, and data application notes. the data are publicly accessible through https://doi.org/10.5067/suborbital/activate/data001 (activate science team, 2020).",AB_0486
