"the distinct functions and phenotypes of human tissues and cells derive from the activity of biological processes that varies in a context-dependent manner. here, we present the process activity (proact) webserver that estimates the preferential activity of biological processes in tissues, cells, and other contexts. users can upload a differential gene expression matrix measured across contexts or cells, or use a built-in matrix of differential gene expression in 34 human tissues. per context, proact associates gene ontology (go) biological processes with estimated preferential activity scores, which are inferred from the input matrix. proact visualizes these scores across processes, contexts, and process-associated genes. proact also offers potential cell-type annotations for cell subsets, by inferring them from the preferential activity of 2001 cell-type-specific processes. thus, proact output can highlight the distinct functions of tissues and cell types in various contexts, and can enhance cell-type annotation efforts. the proact webserver is available at https://netbio.bgu.ac.il/proact/.",AB_0562
"segmentation helps interpret imaging data in a biological context. with the development of powerful tools for automated segmentation, public repositories for imaging data have added support for sharing and visualizing segmentations, creating the need for interactive web-based visualization of 3d volume segmentations. to address the ongoing challenge of integrating and visualizing multimodal data, we developed mol* volumes and segmentations (mol*vs), which enables the interactive, web-based visualization of cellular imaging data supported by macro molecular data and biological annotations. mol*vs is fully integrated into mol* viewer, which is already used for visualization by several public repositories. all emdb and empiar entries with segmentation datasets are accessible via mol*vs, which supports the visualization of data from a wide range of electron and light microscopy experiments. additionally, users can run a local instance of mol*vs to visualize and share custom datasets in generic or application-specific formats including volumes in .ccp4, .mrc, and .map, and segmentations in emdbsff .hff, amira .am, imod .mod, and segger .seg. mol*vs is open source and freely available at https://molstarvolseg.ncbr.muni.cz/.",AB_0562
"the alphafold2 prediction algorithm opened up the possibility of exploring proteins' structural space at an unprecedented scale. currently, >200 million protein structures predicted by this approach are deposited in alphafolddb, covering entire proteomes of multiple organisms, including humans. predicted structures are, however, stored without detailed functional annotations describing their chemical behaviour. partial atomic charges, which map electron distribution over a molecule and provide a clue to its chemical reactivity, are an important example of such data. we introduce the web application alpha charges: a tool for the quick calculation of partial atomic charges for protein structures from alphafolddb. the charges are calculated by the recent empirical method sqe+qp, parameterised for this class of molecules using robust quantum mechanics charges (b3lyp/6-31g*/npa) on propka3 protonated structures. the computed partial atomic charges can be downloaded in common data formats or visualised via the powerful mol* viewer. the alpha charges application is freely available at https://alphacharges.ncbr.muni.cz with no login requirement.

"objectives: this study aimed to present demographic and clinicopathological aspects of oscc identified in pathology service in the uae over a 13-year period and compare these findings to a cohort of 523 cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma using the cancer genome atlas's cbioportal database (http://cbioportal.org).material and methods: histological examination of all hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides and assessment of all demographic and clinical information from laboratory records were performed on all oscc diagnosed between 2005 and 2018.results: males made up 71.4% of the sample of 231 osccs that were evaluated. the patients' average age was 55.38 years. the two most prevalent afflicted sites were the anterior two-thirds of the tongue (57.6%) and the cheek (28.1%). the most prevalent site among smokers were the floor of mouth, cheek, and jaw bones. there was a link between tumor size and numerous anatomical subsites that was shown to be highly significant. oscc in the fom was associated with a 25% mortality rate. patients with oscc of the anterior tongue and cheek had the best prognosis, with only 15.7% and 15.3% of patients dying during follow-up.conclusion: the present investigation found a correlation between the diverse clinicopathological characteristics of the various anatomical subsites in oscc. different anatomical subsites also displayed varying degrees of gene mutation.",AB_0562
"motivation: predicting the binding between t-cell receptor (tcr) and peptide presented by human leucocyte antigen molecule is a highly challenging task and a key bottleneck in the development of immunotherapy. existing prediction tools, despite exhibiting good performance on the datasets they were built with, suffer from low true positive rates when used to predict epitopes capable of eliciting t-cell responses in patients. therefore, an improved tool for tcr-peptide prediction built upon a large dataset combining existing publicly available data is still needed. results: we collected data from five public databases (iedb, tbadb, vdjdb, mcpas-tcr, and 10x) to form a dataset of >3 million tcr-peptide pairs, 3.27% of which were binding interactions. we proposed epitcr, a random forest-based method dedicated to predicting the tcr-peptide interactions. epitcr used simple input of tcr cdr3 beta sequences and antigen sequences, which are encoded by flattened blosum62. epitcr performed with area under the curve (0.98) and higher sensitivity (0.94) than other existing tools (nettcr, imrex, atm-tcr, and pmtnet), while maintaining comparable prediction specificity (0.9). we identified seven epitopes that contributed to 98.67% of false positives predicted by epitcr and exerted similar effects on other tools. we also demonstrated a considerable influence of peptide sequences on prediction, highlighting the need for more diverse peptides in a more balanced dataset. in conclusion, epitcr is among the most well-performing tools, thanks to the use of combined data from public sources and its use will contribute to the quest in identifying neoantigens for precision cancer immunotherapy. availability and implementation: epitcr is available on github (https://github.com/ddiem-ri-4d/epitcr).",AB_0562
"according to various orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (imf), the planetary shock can be either quasi-parallel or quasi-perpendicular. under quasi-parallel conditions a significant number of solar wind suprathermal particles are reflected from the shock and drift along imf, forming an extended and highly turbulent region called the foreshock where various nonlinear plasma phenomena are observed. in this research, a case study of the structures in the foreshock region at mars as observed by mars atmosphere and volatile evolution is performed close to martian aphelion, when the foreshock wave activity is usually low. data from plasma analyzer static and magnetometer mag is used to analyze ion beams angular spectrum and magnetic field dynamics. it is shown that the observed structures are consistent with short large-amplitude magnetic structures (slams), commonly detected in foreshock regions of magnetized and unmagnetized bodies throughout the solar system. finally, the alfven mach number is calculated to analyze characteristics of the observed foreshock structures. the analysis shows that the observed slams-like structures at mars are steepened waves formed by the ion cyclotron resonance between plasma waves propagating along the imf and the back-streaming scattered solar wind h+ and exospheric o+ and o-2(+) ions, with the dominant impact of o+ ions. the steepening process is accompanied with observation of gradients in the diffuse ion density near the bowshock, like it has been previously reported near the earth (e.g., scholer, 1993, https://doi. org/10.1029/92ja01875; tsubouchi & lembege, 2004, ).",AB_0562
"background recently, deep neural networks have been successfully applied in many biological fields. in 2020, a deep learning model alphafold won the protein folding competition with predicted structures within the error tolerance of experimental methods. however, this solution to the most prominent bioinformatic challenge of the past 50 years has been possible only thanks to a carefully curated benchmark of experimentally predicted protein structures. in genomics, we have similar challenges (annotation of genomes and identification of functional elements) but currently, we lack benchmarks similar to protein folding competition. results here we present a collection of curated and easily accessible sequence classification datasets in the field of genomics. the proposed collection is based on a combination of novel datasets constructed from the mining of publicly available databases and existing datasets obtained from published articles. the collection currently contains nine datasets that focus on regulatory elements (promoters, enhancers, open chromatin region) from three model organisms: human, mouse, and roundworm. a simple convolution neural network is also included in a repository and can be used as a baseline model. benchmarks and the baseline model are distributed as the python package `genomicbenchmarks', and the code is available at https://github.com/ml-bioinfo- ceitec/genomic_benchmarks. conclusions deep learning techniques revolutionized many biological fields but mainly thanks to the carefully curated benchmarks. for the field of genomics, we propose a collection of benchmark datasets for the classification of genomic sequences with an interface for the most commonly used deep learning libraries, implementation of the simple neural network and a training framework that can be used as a starting point for future research. the main aim of this effort is to create a repository for shared datasets that will make machine learning for genomics more comparable and reproducible while reducing the overhead of researchers who want to enter the field, leading to healthy competition and new discoveries.",AB_0562
"background lumbar herniated disc (hnp) is mainly treated by conservative management. epidural steroid injection (esi) has been an option to treat failed cases prior to surgery. triamcinolone has been widely used due to its efficacy in bringing about pain reduction for up to three months. however, several reports have shown some severe adverse events. platelet-rich plasma (prp) is made from blood through centrifugation. several studies supported the potential short to long-term effects, and safety of prp injection in treating hnp. the study objective was to evaluate the efficacy of prp in treatment of single-level lumbar hnp in comparison to triamcinolone. methods thirty patients were treated by transforaminal epidural injections. prp was obtained from 24 ml venous blood through standardized double-spin protocol. participants included fifteen patients each being in triamcinolone and prp groups. the same postoperative protocols and medications were applied. the visual analogue scale of leg (legvas), collected at baseline, 2, 6, 12, and 24 weeks, was the primary outcome. the backvas, oswestry disability index (odi), adverse event, and treatment failure were the secondary endpoints. results platelet ratio of prp in fifteen patients was 2.86 +/- 0.85. patients treated by prp injections showed statistically and clinically significant reduction in legvas at 6, 12, and 24 weeks, and in odi at 24 weeks. it demonstrated comparable results on other aspects. no adverse event occurred in either group. conclusion noncommercial epidural double-spin prp yielded superior results to triamcinolone. due to its efficacy and safety, the procedure is recommended in treating single level lumbar hnp. trial registration nct, nct05234840. registered 1 january 2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/ nct05234840.",AB_0562
"every year there is more and more evidence that non-coding rnas play an important role in biological processes affecting various levels of organization of living systems: from the cellular (regulation of gene expression, remodeling and maintenance of chromatin structure, co-transcriptional suppression of transposons, splicing, post-transcriptional rna modifications, etc.) to cell populations and even organismal ones (development, aging, cancer, cardiovascular and many other diseases). the development and creation of mutually complementary databases that will aggregate, unify and structure different types of data can help to reach the system level of studying non-coding rnas. here we present the rna-chrom manually curated analytical database, which contains the coordinates of billions of contacts of thousands of human and mouse rnas with chromatin. through the user-friendly web interface (https://rnachrom2.bioinf.fbb.msu.ru/), two approaches to the analysis of the rna-chromatin interactome were implemented. firstly, to find out whether the rna of interest to a user contacts with chromatin, and if so, with which genes or dna loci? secondly, to find out which rnas are in contact with the dna locus of interest to a user (and probably participate in its regulation), and if there are such, what is the nature of their interaction? for a more detailed study of contact maps and their comparison with other data, the web interface allows a user to view them in the ucsc genome browser.",AB_0562
"introduction a working knowledge of data analytics is becoming increasingly important in the digital health era. interactive dashboards are a useful, accessible format for presenting and disseminating health-related information to a wide audience. however, many oral health researchers receive minimal data visualisation and programming skills. objectives the objective of this protocols paper is to demonstrate the development of an analytical, interactive dashboard, using oral health-related data from multiple national cohort surveys. methods the flexdashboard package was used within the r studio framework to create the structure-elements of the dashboard and interactivity was added with the shiny package. data sources derived from the national longitudinal study of children in ireland and the national children's food survey. variables for input were selected based on their known associations with oral health. the data were aggregated using tidyverse packages such as dplyr and summarised using ggplot2 and kableextra with specific functions created to generate bar-plots and tables. results the dashboard layout is structured by the yaml (yaml ain't markup language) metadata in the r markdown document and the syntax from flexdashboard. survey type, wave of survey and variable selector were set as filter options. shiny's render functions were used to change input to automatically render code and update output. the deployed dashboard is openly accessible at https://dduh.shinyapps.io/dduh/. examples of how to interact with the dashboard for selected oral health variables are illustrated. conclusion visualisation of national child cohort data in an interactive dashboard allows viewers to dynamically explore oral health data without requiring multiple plots and tables and sharing of extensive documentation. dashboard development requires minimal non-standard r coding and can be quickly created with open-source software.",AB_0562
