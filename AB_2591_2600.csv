"cross-modal hashing is an efficient method to embed high-dimensional heterogeneous modal feature descriptors into a consistency-preserving hamming space with low-dimensional. most existing cross-modal hashing methods have been able to bridge the heterogeneous modality gap, but there are still two challenges resulting in limited retrieval accuracy: (1) ignoring the continuous similarity of samples on manifold; (2) lack of discriminability of hash codes with the same semantics. to cope with these problems, we propose a deep consistency-preserving hash auto-encoders model, called dcpha, based on the multi-manifold property of the feature distribution. specifically, dcpha consists of a pair of asymmetric auto-encoders and two semantics-preserving attention branches working in the encoding and decoding stages, respectively. when the number of input medical image modalities is greater than 2, the encoder is a multiple pseudo-siamese network designed to extract specific modality features of different medical image modalities. in addition, we define the continuous similarity of heterogeneous and homogeneous samples on riemann manifold from the perspective of multiple sub-manifolds, respectively, and the two constraints, i.e., multi-semantic consistency and multi-manifold similarity-preserving, are embedded in the learning of hash codes to obtain high quality hash codes with consistency-preserving. the extensive experiments show that the proposed dcpha has the most stable and state-of-the-art performance. we make code and models publicly available: https:// github. com/ socra tes023/ dcpha.",AB_0260
"scaffold proteins drive liquid-liquid phase separation (llps) to form biomolecular condensates and organize various biochemical reactions in cells. dysregulation of scaffolds can lead to aberrant condensate assembly and various complex diseases. however, bioinformatics predictors dedicated to scaffolds are still lacking and their development suffers from an extreme imbalance between limited experimentally identified scaffolds and unlabeled candidates. here, using the joint distribution of hybrid multimodal features, we implemented a positive unlabeled (pu) learning-based framework named pulps that combined probtagging and penalty logistic regression (plr) to profile the propensity of scaffolds. pulps achieved the best auc of 0.8353 and showed an area under the lift curve (aul) of 0.8339 as an estimation of true performance. upon reviewing recent experimentally verified scaffolds, we performed a partial recovery with 2.85% increase in aul from 0.8339 to 0.8577. in comparison, pulps showed a 45.7% improvement in aul compared with plr, whereas 8.2% superiority over other existing tools. our study first proved that pu learning is more suitable for scaffold prediction and demonstrated the widespread existence of phase separation states. this profile also uncovered potential scaffolds that co-drive llps in the human proteome and generated candidates for further experiments. pulps is free for academic research at http://pulps. zbiolab.cn.",AB_0260
"horizontal gene transfer (hgt) is an important driver in genome evolution, gain-of-function, and metabolic adaptation to environmental niches. genome-wide identification of putative hgt events has become increasingly practical, given the rapid growth of genomic data. however, existing hgt analysis toolboxes are not widely used, limited by their inability to perform phylogenetic reconstruction to explore potential donors, and the detection of hgt from both evolutionarily distant and closely related species.in this study, we have developed hgtphylodetect, which is a versatile computational toolbox that combines high-throughput analysis with phylogenetic inference, to facilitate comprehensive investigation of hgt events. two case studies with saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida versatilis demonstrate the ability of hgtphylodetect to identify horizontally acquired genes with high accuracy. in addition, hgtphylodetect enables phylogenetic analysis to illustrate a likely path of gene transmission among the evolutionarily distant or closely related species.the hgtphylodetect computational toolbox is designed for ease of use and can accurately find hgt events with a very low false discovery rate in a high-throughput manner. the hgtphylodetect toolbox and its related user tutorial are freely available at https:// github.com/sysbiochalmers/hgtphylodetect.",AB_0260
"optical remote sensing images are often contaminated by clouds and shadows, resulting in missing data, which greatly hinders consistent earth observation missions. cloud and shadow removal is one of the most important tasks in optical remote sensing image processing. due to the characteristics of active imaging that enable synthetic aperture radar (sar) to penetrate cloud cover and other climatic conditions, sar data are extensively utilized to guide optical remote sensing image cloud and shadow removal. nevertheless, sar data are highly corrupted by speckle noise, which generates artifact pollution to spectral features extracted from optical images and makes sar-optical fusion ill-posed to generate cloud and shadow removal results while retaining high spectral fidelity and reasonable spatial structures. to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, this paper presents a novel hierarchical spectral and structure-preserving fusion network (hs2p), which can recover cloud and shadow regions in optical remote sensing imagery based on the hierarchical fusion of optical and sar remote sensing imagery. in hs2p, we present a deep hierarchical architecture with stacked residual groups (resgroups), which progressively constrains the reconstruction. to pursue the adaptive selection of more informative features for fusion and reduce attention to the features with artifacts brought by clouds and shadows in optical data or speckle noise in sar data, residual blocks with a channel attention mechanism (rbca) are recommended. additionally, a novel collaborative optimization loss function is proposed to preserve spectral features while enhancing structural details. extensive experiments on the publicly open dataset (i.e., sen12ms-cr) demonstrate that the proposed method can robustly recover diverse ground information in optical remote sensing imagery with various cloud types. compared with the state-of-the-art cloud and shadow removal methods, our hs2p achieves significant improvements in terms of quantitative and qualitative results. the source code is publicly available at https://github.com/weifanyi515/hs2p.",AB_0260
"neuropeptides play pivotal roles in different physiological processes and are related to different kinds of diseases. identification of neuropeptides is of great benefit for studying the mechanism of these physiological processes and the treatment of neurological disorders. several state-of-the-art neuropeptide predictors have been developed by using a two-layer stacking ensemble algorithm. although the two-layer stacking ensemble algorithm can improve the feature representability, these models are complex, which are not as efficient as the models based on one classifier. in this study, we proposed a new model, neuroppred-svm, to predict neuropeptides based on the embeddings of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers and other sequential features by using a support vector machine (svm). the experimental results indicate that our model achieved a cross-validation area under the receiver operating characteristic (auroc) curve of 0.969 on the training data set and an auroc of 0.966 on the independent test set. by comparing our model with the other four state-of-the-art models including neuropipred, predneurop, neuroppred-fuse, and neuroppred-frl on the independent test set, our model achieved the highest auroc, matthews correlation coefficient, accuracy, and specificity, which indicate that our model outperforms the existing models. we believed that neuroppred-svm could be a useful tool for identifying neuropeptides with high accuracy and low cost. the data sets and python code are available at https://github. com/liuyf-a/neuroppred-svm.",AB_0260
"interactions between dna and transcription factors (tfs) play an essential role in understanding transcriptional regulation mechanisms and gene expression. due to the large accumulation of training data and low expense, deep learning methods have shown huge potential in determining the specificity of tfs-dna interactions. convolutional network-based and self-attention network-based methods have been proposed for transcription factor binding sites (tfbss) prediction. convolutional operations are efficient to extract local features but easy to ignore global information, while self-attention mechanisms are expert in capturing long-distance dependencies but difficult to pay attention to local feature details. to discover comprehensive features for a given sequence as far as possible, we propose a dual-branch model combining self-attention and convolution, dubbed as dsac, which fuses local features and global representations in an interactive way. in terms of features, convolution and self-attention contribute to feature extraction collaboratively, enhancing the representation learning. in terms of structure, a lightweight but efficient architecture of network is designed for the prediction, in particular, the dual-branch structure makes the convolution and the self-attention mechanism can be fully utilized to improve the predictive ability of our model. the experiment results on 165 chip-seq datasets show that dsac obviously outperforms other five deep learning based methods and demonstrate that our model can effectively predict tfbss based on sequence feature alone. the source code of dsac is available at https://github.com/yubinlab-qust/dsac/.",AB_0260
"motivation: recently, deep learning has become the mainstream methodology for drug-target binding affinity prediction. however, two deficiencies of the existing methods restrict their practical applications. on the one hand, most existing methods ignore the individual information of sequence elements, resulting in poor sequence feature representations. on the other hand, without prior biological knowledge, the prediction of drug-target binding regions based on attention weights of a deep neural network could be difficult to verify, which may bring adverse interference to biological researchers. results: we propose a novel multi-functional and robust drug-target binding affinity prediction (mfr-dta) method to address the above issues. specifically, we design a new biological sequence feature extraction block, namely biomlp, that assists the model in extracting individual features of sequence elements. then, we propose a new elem-feature fusion block to refine the extracted features. after that, we construct a mix-decoder block that extracts drug-target interaction information and predicts their binding regions simultaneously. last, we evaluate mfr-dta on two benchmarks consistently with the existing methods and propose a new dataset, sc-pdb, to better measure the accuracy of binding region prediction. we also visualize some samples to demonstrate the locations of their binding sites and the predicted multi-scale interaction regions. the proposed method achieves excellent performance on these datasets, demonstrating its merits and superiority over the state-of-the-art methods. availability and implementation: https://github.com/ju-huay/mfr. contact: x.song@jiangnan.edu.cn or z.feng@surrey.ac.uk",AB_0260
"motivation: accurate and rapid prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity is a great challenge currently encountered in drug discovery. recent advances have manifested a promising alternative in applying deep learning-based computational approaches for accurately quantifying binding affinity. the structure complementarity between protein-binding pocket and ligand has a great effect on the binding strength between a protein and a ligand, but most of existing deep learning approaches usually extracted the features of pocket and ligand by these two detached modules. results: in this work, a new deep learning approach based on the cross-attention mechanism named capla was developed for improved prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity by learning features from sequence-level information of both protein and ligand. specifically, capla employs the cross-attention mechanism to capture the mutual effect of protein-binding pocket and ligand. we evaluated the performance of our proposed capla on comprehensive benchmarking experiments on binding affinity prediction, demonstrating the superior performance of capla over state-of-the-art baseline approaches. moreover, we provided the interpretability for capla to uncover critical functional residues that contribute most to the binding affinity through the analysis of the attention scores generated by the cross-attention mechanism. consequently, these results indicate that capla is an effective approach for binding affinity prediction and may contribute to useful help for further consequent applications. availability and implementation: the source code of the method along with trained models is freely available at https://github.com/lennylv/capla. contact: tfwu@suda.edu.cn or qiang@suda.edu.cn supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0260
"gene regulation is central to all aspects of organism growth, and understanding it using large-scale func-tional datasets can provide a whole view of biological processes controlling complex phenotypic traits in crops. however, the connection between massive functional datasets and trait-associated gene discovery for crop improvement is still lacking. in this study, we constructed a wheat integrative gene regulatory network (wgrn) by combining an updated genome annotation and diverse complementary functional data -sets, including gene expression, sequence motif, transcription factor (tf) binding, chromatin accessibility, and evolutionarily conserved regulation. wgrn contains 7.2 million genome-wide interactions covering 5947 tfs and 127 439 target genes, which were further verified using known regulatory relationships, condition-specific expression, gene functional information, and experiments. we used wgrn to assign genome-wide genes to 3891 specific biological pathways and accurately prioritize candidate genes asso-ciated with complex phenotypic traits in genome-wide association studies. in addition, wgrn was used to enhance the interpretation of a spike temporal transcriptome dataset to construct high-resolution networks. we further unveiled novel regulators that enhance the power of spike phenotypic trait prediction using machine learning and contribute to the spike phenotypic differences among modern wheat acces-sions. finally, we developed an interactive webserver, wgrn (http://wheat.cau.edu.cn/wgrn), for the com-munity to explore gene regulation and discover trait-associated genes. collectively, this community resource establishes the foundation for using large-scale functional datasets to guide trait-associated gene discovery for crop improvement.",AB_0260
