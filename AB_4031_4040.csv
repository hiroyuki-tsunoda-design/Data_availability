"motivation: meiotic recombination is the main driving force of human genetic diversity, along with mutations. recombinations split into crossovers, separating large chromosomal regions originating from different homologous chromosomes, and non-crossovers (ncos), where a small segment from one chromosome is embedded in a region originating from the homologous chromosome. ncos are much less studied than mutations and crossovers as ncos are short and can only be detected at markers heterozygous in the transmitting parent, leaving most of them undetectable. results: the detectable ncos, known as gene conversions, hide information about ncos, including their number and length, waiting to be unveiled. we introduce ncourd, software, and algorithm, based on an expectation-maximization algorithm, to estimate the number of ncos and their length distribution from gene conversion data. availability and implementation: https://github.com/decodegenetics/ncourd",AB_0404
"in order to identifythe locations of metal ions in thebindingsites of proteins, we have developed a method named the made (macromoleculardensity and structure analysis) approach. the made approach representsan evolution of our previous toolset, the probis h2o (md)methodology, for the identification of conserved water molecules.our method uses experimental structures of proteins homologous toa query, which are subsequently superimposed upon it. areas with aparticular species present in a similar location among many homologousprotein structures are identified using a clustering algorithm. denseclusters likely represent positions containing species important tothe query protein structure or function. we analyze well-characterized apo protein structures and show that the made approach canidentify clusters corresponding to the expected positions of metalions in their binding sites. the greatest advantage of our methodlies in its generality. it can in principle be applied to any speciesfound in protein records; it is not only limited to metal ions. weadditionally demonstrate that the made approach can be successfullyapplied to predict the location of cofactors in computer-modeled structures,e.g., via alphafold. we also conduct a careful protein superpositionmethod comparison and find our methodology robust and the resultslargely independent of the selected protein superposition algorithm.we postulate that with increasing structural data availability, additionalapplications of the made approach will be possible such as non-proteinsystems, water network identification, protein binding site elaboration,and analysis of binding events, all in a dynamic manner. we have implementedthe made approach as a plugin for the pymol molecular visualizationtool. the made plugin is available free of charge at https://gitlab.com/jukic/made_software.",AB_0404
"computational prediction of absolute essential genes using machine learning has gained wide attention in recent years. however, essential genes are mostly conditional and not absolute. experimental techniques provide a reliable approach of identifying conditionally essential genes; however, experimental methods are laborious, time and resource consuming, hence computational techniques have been used to complement the experimental methods. computational techniques such as supervised machine learning, or flux balance analysis are grossly limited due to the unavailability of required data for training the model or simulating the conditions for gene essentiality. this study developed a heuristic-enabled active machine learning method based on a light gradient boosting model to predict essential immune response and embryonic developmental genes in drosophila melanogaster. we proposed a new sampling selection technique and introduced a heuristic function which replaces the human component in traditional active learning models. the heuristic function dynamically selects the unlabelled samples to improve the performance of the classifier in the next iteration. testing the proposed model with four benchmark datasets, the proposed model showed superior performance when compared to traditional active learning models (random sampling and uncertainty sampling). applying the model to identify conditionally essential genes, four novel essential immune response genes and a list of 48 novel genes that are essential in embryonic developmental condition were identified. we performed functional enrichment analysis of the predicted genes to elucidate their biological processes and the result evidence our predictions. immune response and embryonic development related processes were significantly enriched in the essential immune response and embryonic developmental genes, respectively. finally, we propose the predicted essential genes for future experimental studies and use of the developed tool accessible at http://heal.covenantuniversity.edu.ng for conditional essentiality predictions.",AB_0404
"predicting the political bias of news headlines is a challenging task that becomes even more chal-lenging in a multilingual setting with low-resource languages. to deal with this, we propose to utilise inferential commonsense knowledge via a translate-retrieve-translate strategy to introduce a learning framework. to begin with, we use the translate-retrieve-translate strategy to acquire inferential knowledge in the target language. we then employ an attention mechanism to emphasise important inferences. we finally integrate the attended inferences into a multilingual, pre-trained language model for the task of bias prediction. to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we present a dataset of over 62.6k multilingual news headlines annotated with their respective political biases in five low-resource european languages. we evaluate several state-of-the-art multilingual pre-trained language models since their performance tends to vary across languages (low or high resource). evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed framework is effective regardless of the models employed. overall, the best-performing model trained with only headlines shows 0.90 accuracy and f1 and a 0.83 jaccard score. with attended knowledge in our framework, the same model shows an increase in 2.2% accuracy and f1 and a 3.6% jaccard score. extending our experiments to individual languages reveals that the models we analyse for slovenian perform significantly worse than other languages in our dataset. to investigate this, we assess the effect of translation quality on prediction performance. it indicates that the disparity in performance is most likely due to poor translation quality. we release our dataset and scripts at https://github.com/swati17293/kg-multi-bias for future research. our framework has the potential to benefit journalists, social scientists, news producers, and consumers.(c) 2023 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0404
"this paper proposes a method to model masonry shell structures where the shell elements fall into a set of discrete equivalence classes. such shell structure can reduce the fabrication cost and simplify the physical construction due to reuse of a few template shell elements. given a freeform surface, our goal is to generate a small set of template shell elements that can be reused to produce a seamless and buildable structure that closely resembles the surface. the major technical challenge in this process is balancing the desire for high reusability of template elements with the need for a seamless and buildable final structure. to address the challenge, we define three error metrics to measure the seamlessness and buildability of shell structures made from discrete equivalence classes and develop a hierarchical cluster-and-optimize approach to generate a small set of template elements that produce a structure closely approximating the surface with low error metrics. we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on various freeform surfaces and geometric patterns, and validate buildability of our results with four physical prototypes. code and data of this paper are at https://github.com/linsanity81/tileableshell.",AB_0404
"introduction just under half of patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (osa) also have gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord). these conditions appear to be inter-related and continual positive airway pressure (cpap) therapy, the gold standard treatment for osa to prevent airway collapse, has been shown to reduce gord. as the impact of mandibular advancement devices, a second-line therapy for osa, on gord has yet to be investigated, a feasibility study is needed prior to a definitive trial.methods this will be a single-centre, single-blinded, tertiary-care based, interdisciplinary, parallel randomised controlled study. potential osa participants presenting to the sleep department will be pre-screened for gord using validated questionnaires, consented and invited to receive simultaneous home sleep and oesophageal ph monitoring. those with confirmed osa and gord (n=44) will be randomly allocated to receive either cpap (n=22) or mad therapy (n=22). following successful titration and 3 weeks customisation period, participants will repeat the simultaneous sleep and oesophageal ph monitoring while wearing the device. the number of patients screened for recruitment, drop-out rates, patient feedback of the study protocol, costs of interventions and clinical information to inform a definitive study design will be investigated.ethics and dissemination health research authority approval has been obtained from the nottingham 2 research ethics committee, ref:22/em/0157 and the trial has been registered on isrctn (https://doi.org/10.1186/isrctn16013232). definitive findings about the feasibility of doing 24 hour ph oesophageal monitoring while doing a home sleep study will be disseminated via clinical and research networks facilitating valuable insights into the simultaneous management of both conditions.",AB_0404
"background: provision of small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (sq-lnss) during early life improves growth and development. in the in-ternational lipid-based nutrient supplements dyad-ghana trial, prenatal and postnatal sq-lns reduced social-emotional difficulties at age 5 y, with greater effects among children in less-enriched home environments. objectives: we aimed to investigate the effect of prenatal and postnatal sq-lns on children's social-emotional problems at age 9-11 y. methods: in 2009-2011, 1320 pregnant women <20 wk gestation were randomly assigned to receive the following daily until 6 mo postpartum: 1) iron and folic acid until delivery, then placebo, 2) multiple micronutrients (mmns), or 3) sq-lns (20 g/d). children in group 3 received sq-lns from 6 to 18 mo. in 2021, we evaluated children's social-emotional outcomes with 6 assessment tools that used caregiver, teacher, and/or self-report to measure socioemotional difficulties, conduct problems, temperament, mood, anxiety, and emotion management. results: we assessed outcomes in 966 children, comprising 79.4% of 1217 participants eligible for re-enrolment. no significant differences were found between the sq-lns and control (non-lns groups combined) groups. few children (<2%) experienced high parent-reported social-emotional diffi-culties at 9-11 y, in contrast to the high prevalence at age 5 in this cohort (25%). among children in less-enriched early childhood home environments, the sq-lns group had 0.37 sd (-0.04 to 0.82) lower self-reported conduct problems than the control group (p-interaction 1/4 0.047). conclusions: overall positive effects of sq-lns on social-emotional development previously found at age 5 y are not sustained to age 9-11 y; however, there is some evidence of positive effects among children in less-enriched environments. the lack of effects may be owing to low prevalence of social-emotional problems at preadolescence, resulting in little potential to benefit from early nutritional intervention at this age in this outcome domain. follow-up during adolescence, when social-emotional problems more typically onset, may yield further insights. this trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as nct00970866. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/nct00970866",AB_0404
"objective in uganda, the burden of neural tube defects (ntds) poses a serious neurosurgical and public health challenge; however, published data on this patient population are lacking. the authors sought to characterize the population of patients with ntds, maternal characteristics, and referral patterns of these patients, and to quantify the burden of ntds in southwestern uganda.methods a retrospective neurosurgical database at a referral hospital was reviewed to identify all patients with ntds treated between august 2016 and may 2022. descriptive statistics were used to characterize the patient population and maternal risk factors. a wilcoxon rank-sum test and chi-square test were used to determine the association between demographic variables and patient mortality.results a total of 235 patients were identified (121 male, 52%). the median age at presentation was 2 days (iqr 1-8 days). a total of 87% of patients with ntds presented with spina bifida (n = 204) and 31 presented with encephalocele (13%). the most common location of dysraphism was lumbosacral (n = 180, 88%). of all patients, 80% were delivered vaginally (n = 188). overall, 67% of patients were discharged (n = 156) and 10% died (n = 23). the median length of stay was 12 days (iqr 7-19 days). the median maternal age was 26 years (iqr 22-30 years). the majority of mothers received only primary education (n = 100, 43%). the majority of mothers reported prenatal folate use (n = 158, 67%) and regular antenatal care (n = 220, 94%), although only 23% underwent an antenatal ultrasound (n = 55). mortality was as- sociated with younger age at presentation (p = 0.01), need for blood transfusion (p = 0.016) and oxygen supplementation (p < 0.001), and maternal education level (p = 0.001).conclusions to the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to describe the population of patients with ntds and their mothers in southwestern uganda. a prospective case-control study is necessary to identify unique demographic and genetic risk factors associated with ntds in this region. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2023.4.peds2327",AB_0404

"the contribution of deep learning in medical image diagnosis has gained extensive interest due to its excellent performance. furthermore, the interest has also grown in digital pathology since it is considered the golden standard for tumor detection and diagnosis in digital whole slide images (wsis). this paper proposes an end-toend cone-shaped encoder-decoder framework called a multi-scale 3-stacked-layer coned u-net (ms3lcu-net) framework. it boosts performance by using many enhancements and integrating techniques such as blended mutual attention, dilated fusion, edge enhancement, and atrous pooling. furthermore, the morphological postprocessing and test time augmentation techniques are used in ms3lcu-net to refine and smooth the generated segmentations. the experimental results from a quantitative perspective using multiple evaluation metrics and from a qualitative viewpoint by visualizing the generated segmentation predictions conducted on the public paip 2019 and digestpath datasets demonstrated the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed model for tumor segmentation in wsis. the proposed framework yielded an average clipped jaccard index value of 0.7211 on the validation set of the paip 2019 dataset. in contrast, the digestpath dataset achieved an average dice coefficient and f1-score of 0.833 and 0.897, respectively. the code will be available publicly upon acceptance of the paper at https://github.com/heba-abdenabi/ms3lcu-net-.",AB_0404
