"large-scale comparative genomic studies have provided important insights into species evolution and diversity, but also lead to a great challenge to visualize. quick catching or presenting key information hidden in the vast amount of genomic data and relationships among multiple genomes requires an efficient visualization tool. however, current tools for such visualization remain inflexible in layout and/or require advanced computation skills, especially for visualization of genome-based synteny. here, we developed an easy-to-use and flexible layout tool, ngenomesyn [multiple (n) genome synteny], for publication-ready visualization of syntenic relationships of the whole genome or local region and genomic features (e.g. repeats, structural variations, genes) across multiple genomes with a high customization. ngenomesyn provides an easy way for its users to visualize a large amount of data with a rich layout by simply adjusting options for moving, scaling, and rotation of target genomes. moreover, ngenomesyn could be applied on the visualization of relationships on non-genomic data with similar input formats. availability and implementation: ngenomesyn is freely available at github (https://github.com/hewm2008/ ngenomesyn) and zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7645148).",AB_0255
"identifying gene regulatory networks (grns) at the resolution of single cells has long been a great challenge, and the advent of single-cell multi-omics data provides unprecedented opportunities to construct grns. here, we propose a novel strategy to integrate omics datasets of single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing, and using an unsupervised learning neural network to divide the samples with high copy number variation scores, which are used to infer the grn in each gene block. accuracy validation of proposed strategy shows that approximately 80% of transcription factors are directly associated with cancer, colorectal cancer, malignancy and disease by trrust; and most transcription factors are prone to produce multiple transcript variants and lead to tumorigenesis by regnetwork database, respectively. the source code access are available at: https://github.com/cuily-v/colorectal_cancer.",AB_0255
"with the emergence of high-throughput technologies, computational screening based on gene expression profiles has become one of the most effective methods for drug discovery. more importantly, profile-based approaches remarkably enhance novel drug-disease pair discovery without relying on drug- or disease-specific prior knowledge, which has been widely used in modern medicine. however, profile-based systematic screening of active ingredients of traditional chinese medicine (tcm) has been scarcely performed due to inadequate pharmacotranscriptomic data. here, we develop the largest-to-date online tcm active ingredients-based pharmacotranscriptomic platform integrated traditional chinese medicine (itcm) for the effective screening of active ingredients. first, we performed unified high-throughput experiments and constructed the largest data repository of 496 representative active ingredients, which was five times larger than the previous one built by our team. the transcriptome-based multi-scale analysis was also performed to elucidate their mechanism. then, we developed six state-of-art signature search methods to screen active ingredients and determine the optimal signature size for all methods. moreover, we integrated them into a screening strategy, tcm-query, to identify the potential active ingredients for the special disease. in addition, we also comprehensively collected the tcm-related resource by literature mining. finally, we applied itcm to an active ingredient bavachinin, and two diseases, including prostate cancer and covid-19, to demonstrate the power of drug discovery. itcm was aimed to comprehensively explore the active ingredients of tcm and boost studies of pharmacological action and drug discovery. itcm is available at http://itcm.biotcm.net.",AB_0255
"motivation: predicting the associations between human microbes and drugs (mdas) is one critical step in drug development and precision medicine areas. since discovering these associations through wet experiments is time-consuming and labor-intensive, computational methods have already been an effective way to tackle this problem. recently, graph contrastive learning (gcl) approaches have shown great advantages in learning the embeddings of nodes from heterogeneous biological graphs (hbgs). however, most gcl-based approaches don't fully capture the rich structure information in hbgs. besides, fewer mda prediction methods could screen out the most informative negative samples for effectively training the classifier. therefore, it still needs to improve the accuracy of mda predictions. results: in this study, we propose a novel approach that employs the structure-enhanced contrastive learning and self-paced negative sampling strategy for microbe-drug association predictions (scsmda). firstly, scsmda constructs the similarity networks of microbes and drugs, as well as their different meta-path-induced networks. then scsmda employs the representations of microbes and drugs learned from meta-path-induced networks to enhance their embeddings learned from the similarity networks by the contrastive learning strategy. after that, we adopt the self-paced negative sampling strategy to select the most informative negative samples to train the mlp classifier. lastly, scsmda predicts the potential microbe-drug associations with the trained mlp classifier. the embeddings of microbes and drugs learning from the similarity networks are enhanced with the contrastive learning strategy, which could obtain their discriminative representations. extensive results on three public datasets indicate that scsmda significantly outperforms other baseline methods on the mda prediction task. case studies for two common drugs could further demonstrate the effectiveness of scsmda in finding novel mda associations. availability: the source code is publicly available on github https://github.com/yue-yuu/scsmda-master.",AB_0255
"the advance in single-cell rna-sequencing (scrna-seq) sheds light on cell-specific transcriptomic studies of cell developments, complex diseases and cancers. nevertheless, scrna-seq techniques suffer from 'dropout' events, and imputation tools are proposed to address the sparsity. here, rather than imputation, we propose a tool, smurf, to extract the low-dimensional embeddings from cells and genes utilizing matrix factorization with a mixture of poisson-gamma divergent as objective while preserving self-consistency. smurf exhibits feasible cell subpopulation discovery efficacy with obtained cell embeddings on replicated in silico and eight web lab scrna datasets with ground truth cell types. furthermore, smurf can reduce the cell embedding to a 1d-oval space to recover the time course of cell cycle. smurf can also serve as an imputation tool; the in silico data assessment shows that smurf parades the most robust gene expression recovery power with low root mean square error and high pearson correlation. moreover, smurf recovers the gene distribution for the wm989 drop-seq data. smurf is available at https://github.com/deepomicslab/smurf.",AB_0255
"a large number of works have presented the single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) to study the diversity and biological functions of cells at the single-cell level. clustering identifies unknown cell types, which is essential for downstream analysis of scrna-seq samples. however, the high dimensionality, high noise and pervasive dropout rate of scrna-seq samples have a significant challenge to the cluster analysis of scrna-seq samples. herein, we propose a new adaptive fuzzy clustering model based on the denoising autoencoder and self-attention mechanism called the scdasfk. it implements the comparative learning to integrate cell similar information into the clustering method and uses a deep denoising network module to denoise the data. scdasfk consists of a self-attention mechanism for further denoising where an adaptive clustering optimization function for iterative clustering is implemented. in order to make the denoised latent features better reflect the cell structure, we introduce a new adaptive feedback mechanism to supervise the denoising process through the clustering results. experiments on 16 real scrna-seq datasets show that scdasfk performs well in terms of clustering accuracy, scalability and stability. overall, scdasfk is an effective clustering model with great potential for scrna-seq samples analysis. our scdasfk model codes are freely available at https://github.com/lrx2022/scdasfk.",AB_0255
"protein arginine methylation is an important posttranslational modification (ptm) associated with protein functional diversity and pathological conditions including cancer. identification of methylation binding sites facilitates a better understanding of the molecular function of proteins. recent developments in the field of deep neural networks have led to a proliferation of deep learning-based methylation identification studies because of their fast and accurate prediction. in this paper, we propose deepgpgs, an advanced deep learning model incorporating gaussian prior and gated attention mechanism. we introduce a residual network channel to extract the evolutionary information of proteins. then we combine the adaptive embedding with bidirectional long short-term memory networks to form a context-shared encoder layer. a gated multi-head attention mechanism is followed to obtain the global information about the sequence. a gaussian prior is injected into the sequence to assist in predicting ptms. we also propose a weighted joint loss function to alleviate the false negative problem. we empirically show that deepgpgs improves matthews correlation coefficient by 6.3% on the arginine methylation independent test set compared with the existing state-of-the-art methylation site prediction methods. furthermore, deepgpgs has good robustness in phosphorylation site prediction of sars-cov-2, which indicates that deepgpgs has good transferability and the potential to be extended to other modification sites prediction. the open-source code and data of the deepgpgs can be obtained from https://github.com/saizhou1/deepgpgs.",AB_0255
"a-to-i rna editing diversifies human transcriptome to confer its functional effects on the downstream genes or regulations, potentially involving in neurodegenerative pathogenesis. its variabilities are attributed to multiple regulators, including the key factor of genetic variants. to comprehensively investigate the potentials of neurodegenerative disease-susceptibility variants from the view of a-to-i rna editing, we analyzed matched genetic and transcriptomic data of 1596 samples across nine brain tissues and whole blood from two large consortiums, accelerating medicines partnership-alzheimer's disease and parkinson's progression markers initiative. the large-scale and genome-wide identification of 95 198 rna editing quantitative trait loci revealed the preferred genetic effects on adjacent editing events. furthermore, to explore the underlying mechanisms of the genetic controls of a-to-i rna editing, several top rna-binding proteins were pointed out, such as eif4a3, u2af2, nop58, fbl, nop56 and dhx9, since their regulations on multiple rna-editing events were probably interfered by these genetic variants. moreover, these variants may also contribute to the variability of other molecular phenotypes associated with rna editing, including the functions of 3 proteins, expressions of 277 genes and splicing of 449 events. all the analyses results shown in neuroedqtl (https://relab.xidian.edu.cn/neuroedqtl/) constituted a unique resource for the understanding of neurodegenerative pathogenesis from genotypes to phenotypes related to a-to-i rna editing.",AB_0255
"while deep learning (dl)-based models have emerged as powerful approaches to predict protein-protein interactions (ppis), the reliance on explicit similarity measures (e.g. sequence similarity and network neighborhood) to known interacting proteins makes these methods ineffective in dealing with novel proteins. the advent of alphafold2 presents a significant opportunity and also a challenge to predict ppis in a straightforward way based on monomer structures while controlling bias from protein sequences. in this work, we established structure and graph-based predictions of protein interactions (sgppi), a structure-based dl framework for predicting ppis, using the graph convolutional network. in particular, sgppi focused on protein patches on the protein-protein binding interfaces and extracted the structural, geometric and evolutionary features from the residue contact map to predict ppis. we demonstrated that our model outperforms traditional machine learning methods and state-of-the-art dl-based methods using non-representation-bias benchmark datasets. moreover, our model trained on human dataset can be reliably transferred to predict yeast ppis, indicating that sgppi can capture converging structural features of protein interactions across various species. the implementation of sgppi is available at https://github.com/emerson106/sgppi.",AB_0255
"lysine glutarylation (kglu) is a newly discovered post-translational modification of proteins with important roles in mitochondrial functions, oxidative damage, etc. the established biological experimental methods to identify glutarylation sites are often time-consuming and costly. therefore, there is an urgent need to develop computational methods for efficient and accurate identification of glutarylation sites. most of the existing computational methods only utilize handcrafted features to construct the prediction model and do not consider the positive impact of the pre-trained protein language model on the prediction performance. based on this, we develop an ensemble deep-learning predictor deepro-glu that combines convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory network using the deep learning features and traditional handcrafted features to predict lysine glutaryation sites. the deep learning features are generated from the pre-trained protein language model called protbert, and the handcrafted features consist of sequence-based features, physicochemical property-based features and evolution information-based features. furthermore, the attention mechanism is used to efficiently integrate the deep learning features and the handcrafted features by learning the appropriate attention weights. 10-fold cross-validation and independent tests demonstrate that deepro-glu achieves competitive or superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods. the source codes and data are publicly available at https://github.com/xwanggroup/deepro-glu.",AB_0255
