"pipimorpha and its crown-group pipidae possess one of the most extensive fossil records among anurans, known since the early cretaceous in both laurasia and gondwana. pipimorph diversification may have been driven by the breakup of west gondwana during the cretaceous. numerous fossils from south america have been unearthed in the last decade, documenting this event. unfortunately, cretaceous pipimorphs from africa have been limited to a few well-preserved taxa from sub-saharan africa and the arabian peninsula, which hinders our comprehension of pipimorph diversification during this key period. the site of in beceten, in south-east niger, is one of the few mid-late cretaceous (coniacian-santonian) sites from which a pipid, pachycentrata taqueti, is known. here, we describe and name a second pipid from the same locality. this taxon is known by a relatively complete braincase. phylogenetic analyses confirm its position as a pipid, with pipinomorph affinities. this makes in beceten the oldest site with at least two pipids. phylogenetic results are congruent with recent pipimorph relationships, with the presence of an endemic extinct clade in south america, shelaniinae. the phylogenetic results also allow us to review the proposed definition for pipimorpha and its subclades and propose new systematic definitions for them. temporal calibration of the phylogenetic tree based on the fossil record suggests that pipimorphs diversified in a western gondwana block and confirms that south america separated from africa around the mid-cretaceous. between these two events, pipids diverged in africa, giving rise to major extant clades. this study highlights the importance of africa for early pipid diversification during the cretaceous and of the opening of the southern atlantic ocean for anuran dispersion and diversification.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:d40f9a91-d57c-4ed8-b80a-9ca5246599e3",AB_0473
"the paleocene paskapoo formation in alberta, canada, offers a unique opportunity to gain insight into insect diversity at that time. this fossil insect-rich formation has yielded a variety of fossil arthropod specimens, including several wings of odonata related to the genus alloaeschna wighton and wilson, 1986. here, we demonstrate that morphological characters previously used to separate three species are instead the result of intraspecific variability. we reinforce this demonstration using two examples of high variability and plasticity in modern species of the family aeshnidae. accordingly, we reinterpreted the taxonomic position of alloaeschna marklae wighton and wilson, 1986 syn. nov. and alloaeschna quadrata wighton and wilson, 1986 syn. nov. as junior synonyms of alloaeschna paskapooensis wighton and wilson, 1986. in addition, we describe the first occurrence of a zygopteran in the paskapoo formation, namely albertalestes paskapooensis gen. et sp. nov. (synlestidae). importantly, this new taxon is the first representative of the family found in north america. we also reconstructed the relationships within the synlestidae under bayesian inferences with a newly assembled matrix. finally, we discuss the biogeography of the clade considering its fossil record using parsimony ancestral state reconstruction.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:d5282228-2d59-46e9-b712-3dc5a71c42fd",AB_0473
"representing the nodes of continuous-time temporal graphs in a low-dimensional latent space has wide-ranging applications, from prediction to visualization. yet, analyzing continuous-time relational data with timestamped interactions introduces unique challenges due to its sparsity. merely embedding nodes as trajectories in the latent space overlooks this sparsity. however, a natural way to account for this sparsity is to model the uncertainty around the latent positions. in this paper, we propose tgne (temporal gaussian network embedding), an innovative method that bridges two distinct strands of literature: the statistical analysis of networks via latent space models (lsm) and temporal graph machine learning. tgne embeds nodes as piece-wise linear trajectories of gaussian distributions in the latent space, capturing both structural information and uncertainty around the trajectories. we evaluate tgne's effectiveness in reconstructing the original graph and modelling uncertainty. the results demonstrate that tgne generates time-varying embedding locations that can accurately reconstruct missing parts of the network based on observed ones. furthermore, the uncertainty estimates align experimentally with the time-varying degree distribution in the network, providing valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of the graph. to facilitate reproducibility, we provide an open-source implementation of tgne at https://github.com/aida-ugent/tgne/.",AB_0473
"hyperspectral images (hsis) provide hundreds of continuous spectral bands and have been widely used for fine identification of targets with similar appearances. in earlier studies, convolutional neural networks (cnns) have been an effective method for hsis' classification due to their powerful feature extraction capabilities. recently, self-attention (sa)-based vision transformer (vit) architecture has been widely explored to fully represent global information. however, most existing transformer-based models primarily focus on global relationships and lack the ability to capture the multiscale features which are crucial for hsis' classification. this limitation results in inferior performance for transformer-based methods compared with state-of-the-art cnn-based models. to solve this problem, a novel network called multiscale neighborhood attention transformer (msnat) is proposed in this article. unlike previous transformer-based models, msnat emphasizes the neighborhood pixels within a local window size and extracts multiscale spatial information using different local window sizes. in addition, a spatial transformation (st) module is integrated to generate optimized spatial input. the effectiveness of the proposed msnat is verified on three real hyperspectral datasets including university of pavia (up), university of houston (uh), and university of trento (ut). experimental results demonstrate that the proposed msnat method outperforms both cnns and existing transformer-based models, achieving state-of-the-art classification performance with an overall accuracy of 93.34%, 86.26%, and 96.63% on up, uh, and ut, respectively. the source code will be available at https://github.com/xinqiao123/msnat.",AB_0473
"the family zoroasteridae is a clade of extant sea stars found exclusively in deep marine environments (i.e. bathyal environments deeper than 200 m). in the fossil record, seven species have been compared and/or assigned to the zoroasteridae, on a time span ranging from the middle jurassic to the miocene. this study describes a new taxon, viridisaster guerangeri gen. et sp. nov., from the cenomanian of le mans (sarthe, france) and reappraises two mesozoic species, the jurassic terminaster cancriformis and the early cretaceous protothyraster priscus. to test the relationships of the putative fossil zoroasterids with modern taxa, a phylogenetic analysis was performed combining six of the best-known fossil species and 29 forcipulatacean species, including four zoroasteridae. many of the characters that define the extant zoroasteridae do not appear in the fossil record before the cenozoic. the family name is maintained for the crown group only. the family terminasteridae, that accounted for the genera terminaster and alkaidia, is found paraphyletic and is rejected here. the order zorocallida, initially erected for the family zoroasteridae only, is redefined as the sister clade to the forcipulatida that includes the crown-group zoroasteridae and its stem relatives. mesozoic zorocallida are small in size compared to the cenozoic zorocallida, and they express morphological characters that are typical of juvenile zoroasteridae; thus, the emergence of modern forms is likely associated with peramorphic evolution. the palaeoecology of the zoroasteridae and their restriction to deep-sea environments after the eocene is discussed.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:1755afc6-198f-45f2-a2f6-011eac6be10f",AB_0473
"objective: nabiximols is used for treating various symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis (ms). nabiximols is also being investigated as a potential treatment medication for individuals with cannabis use disorder (cud). a variety of investigations have shown that, at low doses, nabiximols is overall well tolerated for ms treatment. however, due to tolerance, the management of cud would likely require much higher doses of nabiximols to be effective. the effects of high doses of nabiximols on clinical laboratory tests remain unclear. therefore, we investigated the sub-chronic effects of high doses of nabiximols on liver function, renal function, and other routine blood tests in this prospective study. methods: we performed a secondary analysis of various blood markers results collected during a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (sativex and behavioral-relapse prevention strategy in cannabis dependence, nct01747850, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/nct01747850). this trial tested the impact of the 12-week administration of nabiximols with a maximum daily dose of up to 113.4 mg thc/105 mg cbd. results: the measurements of the various biomarkers were in the normal range during the 12week time frame. the results indicate an overall good tolerability of high-dose nabiximols on the blood markers measured. conclusion: our preliminary results suggest that high doses of nabiximols might be well tolerated by individuals with cud.",AB_0473
"myoelectric control has been used predominantly in the field of prosthetics, but is an increasingly promising hands-free input modality for emerging consumer markets such as mixed reality. developing robust machine learning-enabled emg control systems, however, has historically required substantial domain expertise. this has presented a significant barrier to entry for researchers, impeded progress in emg-based interaction design, and contributed to the perception that such systems lack the robustness and intuitiveness required for real-world use. to overcome these challenges, we present libemg, an open-source python library for performing offline emg analyses and developing online emg-based interactions. by abstracting the challenges and nuances surrounding myoelectric control, including hardware interfacing, data acquisition, feature extraction/selection, classification, post-processing, and evaluation, we eliminate many of the significant barriers limiting the exploration of this technology. combining expertise from the prosthetics and human-computer interaction communities into a shared library, extensive examples, and documentation, we provide researchers with an accessible tool to accelerate research and improve reproducibility in myoelectric control. in doing so, we aim to facilitate the exploration of this technology, particularly outside prosthesis control, to unlock its potential as a widely applicable hands-free input modality. documentation: https://libemg.github.io/libemg/.",AB_0473
"in few-shot classification, performing well on a testing dataset is a challenging task due to the restricted amount of labelled data available and the unknown distribution. many previously proposed techniques rely on prototypical representations of the support set in order to classify a query set. although this approach works well with a large, in-domain support set, accuracy suffers when transitioning to an out-of-domain setting, especially when using small support sets. to address out-of-domain performance degradation with small support sets, we propose masked embedding modeling for few-shot learning (mem-fs), a novel, self-supervised, generative technique that reinforces few-shot-classification accuracy for a prototypical backbone model. mem-fs leverages the data completion capabilities of a masked autoencoder to expand a given embedded support set. to further increase out-of-domain performance, we also introduce rapid domain adjustment (rda), a novel, self-supervised process for quickly conditioning mem-fs to a new domain. we show that masked support embeddings generated by mem-fs+rda can significantly improve backbone performance on both out-of-domain and in-domain datasets. our experiments demonstrate that applying the proposed technique to an inductive classifier achieves state-of-the-art performance on mini-imagenet, the cvpr l2id classification challenge, and a newly proposed dataset, ikea-fs. we provide code for this work at https://github.com/brikwerk/mem-fs",AB_0473
"choosing how to encode a real-world problem as a machine learning task is an important design decision in machine learning. the task of the glacier calving front modeling has often been approached as a semantic segmentation task. recent studies have shown that combining segmentation with edge detection can improve the accuracy of calving front detectors. building on this observation, we completely rephrase the task as a contour tracing problem and propose a model for explicit contour detection that does not incorporate any dense predictions as intermediate steps. the proposed approach, called charting outlines by recurrent adaptation (cobra), combines convolutional neural networks (cnns) for feature extraction and active contour (ac) models for delineation. by training and evaluating several large-scale datasets of greenland's outlet glaciers, we show that this approach indeed outperforms the aforementioned methods based on segmentation and edge-detection. finally, we demonstrate that explicit contour detection has benefits over pixel-wise methods when quantifying the models' prediction uncertainties. the project page containing the code and animated model predictions can be found at https://khdlr.github.io/cobra/.",AB_0473
"this paper proposes a new method for addressing the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for robust object detection. to this end, we propose an energy-based curriculum for progressively adapting a model, thereby mitigating the pseudo-label noise caused by domain shifts. throughout the adaptation process, we also make use of spatial domain mixing as well as knowledge distillation to improve the pseudo-labels reliability. our method does not require any modifications in the model architecture or any special training tricks or complications. our end-to-end pipeline, although simple, proves effective in adapting object detector neural networks. to verify our method, we perform an extensive systematic set of experiments on: synthetic-to-real scenario, cross-camera setup, cross-domain artistic datasets, and image corruption benchmarks, and establish a new state-of-the-art in several cases. for example, compared to the best existing baselines, our energy-based curriculum learning method for robust object detection (ebcdet), achieves: 1-3 % ap50 improvement on sim10k-to-cityscapes and kitti-to-cityscapes, 3-4 % ap50 boost on pascal-voc-to- comic, watercolor, and clipart, and 1-5% relative robustness improvement on pascal-c, coco-c, and cityscapes-c (1-2 % absolute mpc). code is available at: https://github.com/automotiveml/ebcdet.",AB_0473
