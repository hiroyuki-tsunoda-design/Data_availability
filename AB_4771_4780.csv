"backgroundsingle-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) is a powerful tool for investigating cell abundance changes during tissue regeneration and remodeling processes. differential cell abundance supports the initial clustering of all cells; then, the number of cells per cluster and sample are evaluated, and the dependence of these counts concerning the phenotypic covariates of the samples is studied. analysis heavily depends on the clustering method. partitioning around medoids (pam or k-medoids) represents a well-established clustering procedure that leverages the downstream interpretation of clusters by pinpointing real individuals in the dataset as cluster centers (medoids) without reducing dimensions. of note, pam suffers from high computational costs and memory requirements.resultsthis paper proposes a method for differential abundance analysis using pam as a clustering method and negative binomial regression as a statistical model to relate covariates to cluster/cell counts. we used this approach to study the differential cell abundance of human endometrial cell types throughout the natural secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. we developed a new r package -scellpam-, that incorporates an efficient parallel c++ implementation of pam, and applied this package in this study. we compared the pam-bs clustering method with other methods and evaluated both the computational aspects of its implementation and the quality of the classifications obtained using distinct published datasets with known subpopulations that demonstrate promising results.conclusionsthe implementation of pam-bs, included in the scellpam package, exhibits robust performance in terms of speed and memory usage compared to other related methods. pam allowed quick and robust clustering of sets of cells with a size ranging from 70,000 to 300,000 cells. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scellpam/index.html. finally, our approach provides important new insights into the transient subpopulations associated with the fertile time frame when applied to the study of changes in the human endometrium during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle.",AB_0478
"motivation: biological tissues are dynamic and highly organized. multi-scale models are helpful tools to analyse and understand the processes determining tissue dynamics. these models usually depend on parameters that need to be inferred from experimental data to achieve a quantitative understanding, to predict the response to perturbations, and to evaluate competing hypotheses. however, even advanced inference approaches such as approximate bayesian computation (abc) are difficult to apply due to the computational complexity of the simulation of multi-scale models. thus, there is a need for a scalable pipeline for modeling, simulating, and parameterizing multi-scale models of multi-cellular processes. results: here, we present fitmulticell, a computationally efficient and user-friendly open-source pipeline that can handle the full workflow of modeling, simulating, and parameterizing for multi-scale models of multi-cellular processes. the pipeline is modular and integrates the modeling and simulation tool morpheus and the statistical inference tool pyabc. the easy integration of high-performance infrastructure allows to scale to computationally expensive problems. the introduction of a novel standard for the formulation of parameter inference problems for multi-scale models additionally ensures reproducibility and reusability. by applying the pipeline to multiple biological problems, we demonstrate its broad applicability, which will benefit in particular image-based systems biology. availability and implementation: fitmulticell is available open-source at https://gitlab.com/fitmulticell/fit.",AB_0478
"the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncaas) into proteins is a powerful technique used in various research fields. genetic code expansion (gce) is the most common way to achieve this: a specific codon is selected to be decoded by a dedicated trna orthogonal to the endogenous ones. in the past 30 years, great progress has been made to obtain novel trna synthetases (aarss) accepting a variety of ncaas with distinct physicochemical properties, to develop robust in vitro assays or approaches for codon reassignment. this sparked the use of the technique, leading to the accumulation of publications, from which gathering all relevant information can appear daunting. here we present inclusive (https://non-canonical-aas.biologie.uni-freiburg.de/), a manually curated, extensive repository using standardized nomenclature that provides organized information on ncaas successfully incorporated into target proteins as verified by mass spectrometry. since we focused on trna synthetase-based trna loading, we provide the sequence of the trna and aars used for the incorporation. derived from more than 687 peer-reviewed publications, it currently contains 2432 entries about 466 ncaas, 569 protein targets, 500 aarss and 144 trnas. we foresee inclusive will encourage more researchers to experiment with ncaa incorporation thus contributing to the further development of this exciting technique. graphical abstract",AB_0478
"efficient road and building footprint extraction from satellite images are predominant in many remote sensing applications. however, precise segmentation map extraction is quite challenging due to the diverse building structures camouflaged by trees, similar spectral responses between the roads and buildings, and occlusions by heterogeneous traffic over the roads. existing convolutional neural network (cnn)-based methods focus on either enriched spatial semantics learning for the building extraction or the fine-grained road topology extraction. the profound semantic information loss due to the traditional pooling mechanisms in cnn generates fragmented and disconnected road maps and poorly segmented boundaries for the densely spaced small buildings in complex surroundings. in this paper, we propose a novel attention-aware segmentation framework, multi-scale supervised dilated multiple-path attention network (mssdmpa-net), equipped with two new modules dynamic attention map guided index pooling (damip) and dynamic attention map guided spatial and channel attention (damsca) to precisely extract the building footprints and road maps from remotely sensed images. damip mines the salient features by employing a novel index pooling mechanism to retain important geometric information. on the other hand, damsca simultaneously extracts the multi-scale spatial and spectral features. besides, using dilated convolution and multi-scale deep supervision in optimizing mssdmpa-net helps achieve stellar performance. experimental results over the seven benchmark building and road extraction datasets namely, porto, shanghai, massachusetts road, massachusetts building, synthinel-1, whu satellite i and whu aerial imagery dataset, ensures mssdmpa-net as the state-of-the-art (sota) method for building and road extraction as our method beats the next best alternatives by 5.94%, 2.55%, 3.97%, 11.64%, 6.86%, 6.92%, 2.57% iou and 3.98%, 1.90%, 2.43%, 7.17%, 3.98%, 4.99%, 1.37% f1 score, respectively, over the mentioned datasets. the code has been released in: https://github.com/shirshabose/ mssdmpa-net.",AB_0478

"one challenge in the development of novel drugs is their interaction with potential off-targets, which can cause unintended side-effects, that can lead to the subsequent withdrawal of approved drugs. at the same time, these off-targets may also present a chance for the repositioning of withdrawn drugs for new indications, which are potentially rare or more severe than the original indication and where certain adverse reactions may be avoidable or tolerable. to enable further insights into this topic, we updated our database withdrawn by adding pharmacovigilance data from the fda adverse event reporting system (faers), as well as mechanism of action and human disease pathway prediction features for drugs that are or were temporarily withdrawn or discontinued in at least one country. as withdrawal data are still spread over dozens of national websites, we are continuously updating our lists of discontinued or withdrawn drugs and related (off-)targets. furthermore, new systematic entry points for browsing the data, such as an atc tree, were added, increasing the accessibility of the database in a user-friendly way. withdrawn 2.0 is publicly available without the need for registration or login at https://bioinformatics.charite.de/withdrawn_3/index.php. graphical abstract",AB_0478
"our research aims to generate robust, dense 3-d depth maps for robotics, especially autonomous driving applications. since cameras output 2-d images and active sensors such as lidar or radar produce sparse depth measurements, dense depth maps need to be estimated. recent methods based on visual transformer networks have outperformed conventional deep learning approaches in various computer vision tasks, including depth prediction, but have focused on the use of a single camera image. this article explores the potential of visual transformers applied to the fusion of monocular images, semantic segmentation, and projected sparse radar reflections for robust monocular depth estimation. the addition of a semantic segmentation branch is used to add object-level understanding and is investigated in a supervised and unsupervised manner. we evaluate our new depth estimation approach on the nuscenes dataset where it outperforms existing state-of-the-art camera-radar depth estimation methods. we show that models can benefit from an additional segmentation branch during the training process by transfer learning even without running segmentation at inference. further studies are needed to investigate the usage of 4-d-imaging radars and enhanced ground-truth generation in more detail. the related code is available as open-source software under https://github.com/tumftm/camradepth.",AB_0478
"rna molecules play crucial roles in various biological processes. they mediate their function mainly by interacting with other rnas or proteins. at present, information about these interactions is distributed over different resources, often providing the data in simple tab-delimited formats that differ between the databases. there is no standardized data format that can capture the nature of all these different interactions in detail. availability and implementation: here, we propose the rna interaction format (rif) for the detailed representation of rna-rna and rna-protein interactions and provide reference implementations in c/c++, python, and javascript. rif is released under licence gnu general public license version 3 (gnu gplv3) and is available on https://github.com/rnabioinfo/rna-interaction-format.",AB_0478

"background & aims: vitamin b12 plays a crucial role in cognition, but its effect might be regulated by the presence of other micronutrients, such as folate. the aim was to evaluate the effects of vitamin b12 on cognitive performance according to adherence to the mediterranean diet, and whether the mediterra-nean diet also results in increased folate or vitamin b12 levels. methods: this is a cohort study nested in a randomized controlled clinical trial performed in hospital clinic in barcelona, spain. a total of 170 participants of the predimed trial (barcelona -hospital clinic site) aged 55-80 years at high cardiovascular risk were included. adherence to the mediterranean diet was assessed using a validated 14-item questionnaire, memory function was evaluated with a battery of neuropsychological tests and serum vitamin b12 and folate were determined using an automated elec-trochemiluminiscence immunoassay system. results: in the multivariable adjusted linear regression model, serum vitamin b12 concentration pre-sented a significant correlation with memory function (r2 = 0.57; p = 0.028) in participants with high adherence to the mediterranean diet whereas the correlation was weak and inverse for those who presented a low adherence to the mediterranean diet (r2 = 0.37, p = 0.731). mediterranean diet adherence showed a positive association with serum folate, but not with serum vitamin b12. conclusions: in an older mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk, changes in serum vitamin b12 correlate with better memory function only in the context of a high adherence to the mediterranean pattern, suggesting that the effects of vitamin b12 goes further than a mere nutritional requirement. institutional review board statement: the study was conducted according to the guidelines of the declaration of helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board of the 11 participating centres. the study was registered with the international standard randomized controlled trial number (isrctn) 35739639 (https://www.isrctn.com/isrctn35739639).(c) 2023 published by elsevier ltd.",AB_0478
