"motivation several applications in constraint-based modelling can be mathematically formulated as cardinality optimization problems involving the minimization or maximization of the number of nonzeros in a vector. these problems include testing for stoichiometric consistency, testing for flux consistency, testing for thermodynamic flux consistency, computing sparse solutions to flux balance analysis problems and computing the minimum number of constraints to relax to render an infeasible flux balance analysis problem feasible. such cardinality optimization problems are computationally complex, with no known polynomial time algorithms capable of returning an exact and globally optimal solution.results by approximating the zero-norm with nonconvex continuous functions, we reformulate a set of cardinality optimization problems in constraint-based modelling into a difference of convex functions. we implemented and numerically tested novel algorithms that approximately solve the reformulated problems using a sequence of convex programs. we applied these algorithms to various biochemical networks and demonstrate that our algorithms match or outperform existing related approaches. in particular, we illustrate the efficiency and practical utility of our algorithms for cardinality optimization problems that arise when extracting a model ready for thermodynamic flux balance analysis given a human metabolic reconstruction.availability and implementation open source scripts to reproduce the results are here https://github.com/opencobra/cobra.papers/2023_cardopt with general purpose functions integrated within the constraint-based reconstruction and analysis toolbox: https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox.",AB_0403
"since its launch in 2000, the cluster fleet visited a vast domain of the circum-terrestrial environment, from the upstream solar wind and the distant tail, down to the plasmasphere, scanning in detail all magnetospheric regions during over two solar cycles. this led to an unprecedentedly rich data collection of multi-point measurements which will be used for years to come to decipher the mechanisms of solar-terrestrial interactions. the large volume of data gathered by cluster requires special strategies to make efficient use of it. to address this issue we constructed a browsable database containing parameters of the detected ultra low frequency waves and of the spacecraft formation geometry. the primary data used to derive the parameters are the magnetic field, the electric field and the electron density. the data is resampled to a cadence of 1 s and processed using a sliding analysis window of 2,048 s with a step of 256 s over 24 hr intervals. this results in time-frequency arrays for each parameter covering the 0.5 mhz to 0.5 hz frequency range. the database is accessible at http://plasma.spacescience.ro/cluster.html. in total there are 47 wave parameters in the database, among them being the ellipticity, the degree of polarization, the (unsigned) wave vector direction, and the poynting vector. plots for the planarity, elongation, and degeneration of the cluster tetrahedron are also available. at the moment, the database covers measurements made between 01 january 2001 and 31 december 2020 with more data being added in time. here we present this database, discuss the methods used to derive the parameters and give practical examples.",AB_0403
"text line segmentation is an important step in the historical document image analysis pipeline to supply useful information for recognition, keyword spotting and indexing. many handcrafted-based and learning-based approaches have been developed to cope with text line extraction challenges. in this work we present a hybrid technique which combines a convolutional-based denoising task and heuristic seam carving framework. we propose the following changes to the original seam carving: (1) we applied adaptive slice to anticipate miss-extraction on a short text during medial seam computation. (2) we applied a triple smoothing to find the best local maxima of the smoothed horizontal projection profile which represents candidate medial seams. (3) we utilized five post-processing steps aimed at reconstructing a more precise medial seam. three different palm leaf data sets: old sundanese, old balinese, and old khmer, have been used to compare convolutional seam carving (csc) to several baseline methods, including the original seam carving. experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other current handcrafted-based baselines on all three palm leaf manuscript (plm) data sets. on the old sundanese data sets, csc can produce a significant improvement of the performance rate compared to all other baseline approaches, and it also enhance the measurement on old balinese and old khmer datasets. in the ablation study, we discovered that a foreground extraction step is not only able to reduce noises and color degradation but also provide better separation of text region. following that, an adaptive slice and triple smoothing approach contribute to solve the text length variation problem. finally, post-processing steps were effective in connecting discontinuous medial seam. the code has been published in https://github.com/erickpaulus/text-line-segmentation.",AB_0403

"background the enhancing nutrition and antenatal infection treatment (enat) intervention was implemented in ethiopia to improve newborn birth weight (bw) by strengthening the contents and quality of antenatal care (anc), especially point-of-care testing for maternal infections. this study examined the effect of the enat intervention on birth weight.methods we conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of 22 clusters (health centers), randomized equally between 11 intervention and 11 control clusters. this study enrolled and followed pregnant women from anc booking to the end of pregnancy or loss to follow-up. the primary outcome was mean bw, and the incidence of low birth weight (lbw) was the secondary outcome. we presented univariate comparisons of outcomes between the intervention and control arms for mean bw and lbw. multilevel analyses using random effects models were performed to adjust for clustering and individual-level covariates.results we enrolled and followed up 4,868 and 4,821 pregnant women in the intervention and control arms, respectively, from march 2021-july 2022. during follow-up, 3445 pregnant women in the intervention and 3192 in the control delivered in the health centers, and bw measurements of their babies were recorded within 48 h. the mean bw was 3,152 g (standard deviation (sd) = 339.8 g) in the intervention and 3,044 g (sd = 353.8 g) in the control arms (mean difference, 108 g; 95% confidence interval (ci): 91.3-124.6; p = 0.000). adjusting for clustering and several covariates, the mean bw remained significantly higher in the intervention arm than in the control arm (adjusted ss coef., 114.3; p = 0.011). the incidence of lbw was 4.7% and 7.3% in the intervention and control arms, respectively. the adjusted risk of lbw was significantly lower by 36% in the intervention arm than in the control arm (adjusted relative risk, 0.645; p = 0.027).conclusion this study provided sufficient evidence of the effectiveness of the enat intervention in improving birth weight in the study population. the intervention demonstrated that an increase in birth weight can be attained by availing point-of-care testing, strengthening infection prevention, and maternal nutrition within the anc platform of public health facilities in a low-income setting.trial registrationregistered at pan african clinical trial registry (pactr) database dated 09/05/2023, https://pactr.samrc.ac.za/trialdisplay.aspx?trialid=25493. the unique identification number for the registry is pactr202305694761480.",AB_0403
"motivation: increasing efforts are being made in the field of machine learning to advance the learning of robust and accurate models from experimentally measured data and enable more efficient drug discovery processes. the prediction of binding affinity is one of the most frequent tasks of compound bioactivity modelling. learned models for binding affinity prediction are assessed by their average performance on unseen samples, but point predictions are typically not provided with a rigorous confidence assessment. approaches, such as the conformal predictor framework equip conventional models with a more rigorous assessment of confidence for individual point predictions. in this article, we extend the inductive conformal prediction framework for interaction data, in particular the compound-target binding affinity prediction task. the new framework is based on dynamically defined calibration sets that are specific for each testing pair and provides prediction assessment in the context of calibration pairs from its compound-target neighbourhood, enabling improved estimates based on the local properties of the prediction model. results: the effectiveness of the approach is benchmarked on several publicly available datasets and tested in realistic use-case scenarios with increasing levels of difficulty on a complex compound-target binding affinity space. we demonstrate that in such scenarios, novel approach combining applicability domain paradigm with conformal prediction framework, produces superior confidence assessment with valid and more informative prediction regions compared to other 'state-of-the-art' conformal prediction approaches. availability and implementation: dataset and the code are available on github (https://github.com/mlkr-rbi/dad).",AB_0403
"motivation: analyzing large-scale single-cell transcriptomic datasets generated using different technologies is challenging due to the presence of batch-specific systematic variations known as batch effects. since biological and technological differences are often interspersed, detecting and accounting for batch effects in rna-seq datasets are critical for effective data integration and interpretation. low-dimensional embeddings, such as principal component analysis (pca) are widely used in visual inspection and estimation of batch effects. linear dimensionality reduction methods like pca are effective in assessing the presence of batch effects, especially when batch effects exhibit linear patterns. however, batch effects are inherently complex and existing linear dimensionality reduction methods could be inadequate and imprecise in the presence of sophisticated nonlinear batch effects. results: we present batch effect estimation using nonlinear embedding (beene), a deep nonlinear auto-encoder network which is specially tailored to generate an alternative lower dimensional embedding suitable for both linear and nonlinear batch effects. beene simultaneously learns the batch and biological variables from rna-seq data, resulting in an embedding that is more robust and sensitive than pca embedding in terms of detecting and quantifying batch effects. beene was assessed on a collection of carefully controlled simulated datasets as well as biological datasets, including two technical replicates of mouse embryogenesis cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three largely different experiments and five studies of pancreatic islet cells. availability and implementation: beene is freely available as an open source project at https://github.com/ashiq24/beene.",AB_0403

"in order to classify linearly non-separable data, neurons are typically organized into multi-layer neural networks that are equipped with at least one hidden layer. inspired by some recent discoveries in neuroscience, we propose a new model of artificial neuron along with a novel activation function enabling the learning of nonlinear decision boundaries using a single neuron. we show that a standard neuron followed by our novel apical dendrite activation (ada) can learn the xor logical function with 100% accuracy. furthermore, we conduct experiments on six benchmark data sets from computer vision, signal processing and natural language processing, i.e. moroco, utkface, crema-d, fashion-mnist, tiny imagenet and imagenet, showing that the ada and the leaky ada functions provide superior results to rectified linear units (relu), leaky relu, rbf and swish, for various neural network architectures, e.g. one-hidden-layer or two-hidden-layer multi-layer perceptrons (mlps) and convolutional neural networks (cnns) such as lenet, vgg, resnet and character-level cnn. we obtain further performance improvements when we change the standard model of the neuron with our pyramidal neuron with apical dendrite activations (pynada). our code is available at: https://github.com/raduionescu/pynada.",AB_0403
"toxin-antitoxin (ta) systems are a large group of small genetic modules found in prokaryotes and their mobile genetic elements. type ii tas are encoded as bicistronic (two-gene) operons that encode two proteins: a toxin and a neutralizing antitoxin. using our tool netflax (standing for network-flags for toxins and antitoxins), we have performed a large-scale bioinformatic analysis of proteinaceous tas, revealing interconnected clusters constituting a core network of ta-like gene pairs. to understand the structural basis of toxin neutralization by antitoxins, we have predicted the structures of 3,419 complexes with alphafold2. together with mutagenesis and functional assays, our structural predictions provide insights into the neutralizing mechanism of the hyperpromiscuous panacea antitoxin domain. in antitoxins composed of standalone panacea, the domain mediates direct toxin neutralization, while in multidomain antitoxins the neutralization is mediated by other domains, such as pad1, phd-c, and zfd. we hypothesize that panacea acts as a sensor that regulates ta activation. we have experimentally validated 16 netflax ta systems and used domain annotations and metabolic labeling assays to predict their potential mechanisms of toxicity (such as membrane disruption, and inhibition of cell division or protein synthesis) as well as biological functions (such as antiphage defense). we have validated the antiphage activity of a rosmerta system encoded by gordonia phage kita, and used fluorescence microscopy to confirm its predicted membrane-depolarizing activity. the interactive version of the netflax ta network that includes structural predictions can be accessed at http://netflax.webflags.se/.",AB_0403
