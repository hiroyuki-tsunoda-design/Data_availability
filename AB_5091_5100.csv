"background:carotid artery revascularization can result in new ischemic brain lesions on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. this study aimed to investigate the relationship between periprocedural ischemic diffusion-weighted imaging (dwi) lesions after carotid artery revascularization and recurrent long-term cerebrovascular events.methods:a secondary observational prospective cohort analysis of existing clinical trial data was performed on 162 patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis that were previously randomized to carotid artery stenting or carotid endarterectomy in the icss (international carotid stenting study) and included in the magnetic resonance imaging substudy. magnetic resonance imagings were performed 1 to 7 days before and 1 to 3 days after treatment. the primary composite clinical outcome was the time to any stroke or transient ischemic attack during follow-up. patients with new diffusion-weighted imaging (dwi) lesions on posttreatment magnetic resonance imaging scan (dwi+) were compared with patients without new lesions (dwi-).results:the median time of follow-up was 8.6 years (interquartile range, 5.0-12.5). kaplan-meier cumulative incidence for the primary outcome after 12.5-year follow-up was 35.3% (se, 8.9%) in dwi+ patients and 31.1% (se, 5.6%) in dwi- patients. uni- and multivariable regression analyses did not show significant differences (hazard ratio, 1.50 [95% ci, 0.76-2.94] and hazard ratio, 1.30 [95% ci, 0.10-1.02], respectively). higher event rate of the primary outcome in dwi+ patients in the overall cohort was mainly caused by events in the carotid artery stenting group.conclusions:based on our outcome analysis within the icss magnetic resonance imaging substudy, dwi lesions following carotid revascularization did not seem to have a relationship with long-term stroke risk.registration:url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: isrctn 25337470.",AB_0510
"background and objectiveautomated machine learning or automl has been widely deployed in various industries. however, their adoption in healthcare, especially in clinical settings is constrained due to a lack of clear understanding and explainability. the aim of this study is to utilize automl for the prediction of functional outcomes in patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy and compare it with traditional ml models with a focus on the explainability of the trained models.methodsa total of 156 patients of acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion (lvo) who underwent mechanical thrombectomy within 24 h of stroke onset were included in the study. a total of 34 treatment variables including clinical, demographic, imaging, and procedure-related data were extracted. various conventional machine learning models such as decision tree classifier, logistic regression, random forest, knn, and svm as well as various automl models such as autogluon, mljar, auto-sklearn, tpot, and h2o were used to predict the modified rankin score (mrs) at the time of patient discharge and 3 months follow-up. the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and auc for traditional ml and automl models were compared.resultsthe automl models outperformed the traditional ml models. for the prediction of mrs at discharge, the highest testing accuracy obtained by traditional ml models for the decision tree classifier was 74.11%, whereas for automl which was obtained through autogluon, it showed an accuracy of 88.23%. similarly, for mrs at 3 months, the highest testing accuracy of traditional ml was that of the svm classifier at 76.5%, whereas that of automl was 85.18% obtained through mljar. the 24-h aspects score was the most important predictor for mrs at discharge whereas for prediction of mrs at 3 months, the most important factor was mrs at discharge.conclusionautomated machine learning models based on multiple treatment variables can predict the functional outcome in patients more accurately than traditional ml models. the ease of clinical coding and deployment can assist clinicians in the critical decision-making process. we have developed a demo application which can be accessed at https://mrs-score-calculator.onrender.com/.",AB_0510
"cervical squamous cell carcinoma, more commonly cervical cancer, is the fourth common cancer among women worldwide with substantial burden of disease, and less-invasive, reliable and effective methods for its prognosis are necessary today. micro-rnas are increasingly recognized as viable alternative biomarkers for direct diagnosis and prognosis of disease conditions, including various cancers. in this work, we addressed the problem of systematically developing an mirna-based nomogram for the reliable prognosis of cervical cancer. towards this, we preprocessed public-domain mirna -omics data from cervical cancer patients, and applied a cascade of filters in the following sequence: (i) differential expression criteria with respect to controls; (ii) significance with univariate survival analysis; (iii) passage through dimensionality reduction algorithms; and (iv) stepwise backward selection with multivariate cox modeling. this workflow yielded a compact prognostic demir signature of three mirnas, namely hsa-mir-625-5p, hs-mir-95-3p, and hsa-mir-330-3p, which were used to construct a risk-score model for the classification of cervical cancer patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. the risk-score model was subjected to evaluation on an unseen test dataset, yielding a one-year auroc of 0.84 and five-year auroc of 0.71. the model was validated on an out-of-domain, external dataset yielding significantly worse prognosis for high-risk patients. the risk-score was combined with significant features of the clinical profile to establish a predictive prognostic nomogram. both the mirna-based risk score model and the integrated nomogram are freely available for academic and not-for-profit use at cescprog, a web-app (https://apalania.shinyapps.io/cescprog).",AB_0510
"short tandem repeats (strs) are consecutive repetitions of one to six nucleotide motifs. they are hyper -variable due to the high prevalence of repeat unit insertions or deletions primarily caused by polymerase slippage during replication. genetic variation at strs has been shown to influence a range of traits in humans, including gene expression, cancer risk, and autism. until recently strs have been poorly studied since they pose significant challenges to bioinformatics analyses. moreover, genome-wide analysis of str variation in population-scale cohorts requires large amounts of data and computational resources. however, the recent advent of genome-wide analysis tools has resulted in multiple large genome-wide datasets of str variation spanning nearly two million genomic loci in thousands of individuals from diverse populations. here we present webstr, a database of genetic variation and other characteris-tics of genome-wide strs across human populations. webstr is based on reference panels of more than 1.7 million human strs created with state of the art repeat annotation methods and can easily be extended to include additional cohorts or species. it currently contains data based on str genotypes for individuals from the 1000 genomes project, h3africa, the genotype-tissue expression (gtex) project and colorectal cancer patients from the tcga dataset. webstr is implemented as a relational database with programmatic access available through an api and a web portal for browsing data. the web portal is publicly available at https://webstr.ucsd.edu.(c) 2023 the authors. published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0510
"marine sediments play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by acting as the ultimate sink of both terrestrial and marine organic carbon. to understand the spatiotemporal variability in the content, sources, and dynamics of organic carbon in marine sediments, a curated and harmonized database of organic carbon and associated parameters is needed, which has prompted the development of the modern ocean sediment archive and inventory of carbon (mosaic) database (http://mosaic.ethz.ch/, last access: 26 july 2023; 10.5281/zenodo.8322094, paradis, 2023; 10.5168/mosaic019.1, van der voort et al., 2019 ). mosaic version 2.0 has expanded the spatiotemporal coverage of the original database by >400 % and now holds data from more than 21 000 individual sediment cores from different continental margins on a global scale. additional variables have also been incorporated into mosaic v.2.0 that are crucial to interpret the quantity, origin, and age of organic carbon in marine sediments globally. sedimentological parameters (e.g. grain size fractions and mineral surface area) help understand the effect of hydrodynamic sorting and mineral protection on the distribution of organic carbon, while molecular biomarker signatures (e.g. lignin phenols, fatty acids, and alkanes) can help constrain the specific origin of organic matter. mosaic v.2.0 also stores data on specific sediment and molecular fractions, which provide further insight into the processes that affect the degradation and ageing of organic carbon in marine sediments. data included within mosaic are continuously expanding, and version control will allow users to benefit from updated versions while ensuring reproducibility of their findings.",AB_0510
"glaucoma is a pathological eye condition which requires accurate optic disc and optic cup segmentation for diagnosis. this study proposes responsive fusion attention u-convnext, a novel encoder decoder network, for semantic segmentation of optic disc and optic cup structures from fundus images. response fusion attention u-convnext is a u-net like model containing a pre-trained convnext encoder network and a light-weight, modified convnext decoder network having skip connections between the encoder and decoder blocks. we also propose a new attention gate module called dual-path response fusion attention (dprfa) for smoothing the concatenation process of the encoder and upsampled feature maps. in addition, we propose a modified loss function by combining cross entropy, dice and jaccard losses for training the model accurately. the model has four sizes and all of them are trained and validated on drishti-gs and refuge datasets. our proposed models have acheived a dice coefficient of 0.9822 and 0.9269 on optic disc and optic cup segmentation of drishti-gs dataset and a dice coefficient of 0.9788 and 0.9086 on optic disc and optic cup segmentation of refuge dataset. the experimental results thus obtained by our suggested models have shown state-of-the-art results when compared to other existing models. code and models are available at : https://github.com/siddmallick/rfaucnxt-official.",AB_0510
"glyptothorax primusplicae, sp. n., is described from the pamtujang river, a tributary of the chakpi river, chindwin basin in manipur, india. it is diagnosable by the following combination of characteristics: the presence of plicae on the ventral surface of the pectoral-fin spine and on the first pelvic-fin ray; the dorsal fin located nearer to the tip of the snout than to the adipose fin origin; a nasal barbel reaching the anterior margin of the orbit and the presence of three stripes on the body. this species is the first possessing plicae on the paired fins in the chindwin-irrawaddy river drainage.http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:5376e105-eef0-4ef3-b505-74d5052103bc",AB_0510
"the conventional sensor coupling of the sensor in an exoskeleton robot suffers from inaccurate human motion tracking due to irregular inertial loading on the sensor axis. it may cause sensor axis misalignment and performance degradation and damage the sensor permanently, especially in the multiple degrees of freedom (dofs) exoskeleton robot. in this article, we proposed a novel design of an adaptive sensor coupling-based 7-dof exoskeleton (asc-exo) for motion tracking and telemanipulation. the adaptive sensor coupling (asc) mechanism has been designed based on the flexure structure cantilever with a slew ring, which suppresses irregular inertial loading on the sensor and is stiff enough along the sensor rotation in the z-axis and compliant on the other axes. the slew ring allows smooth joint rotation. furthermore, the sensor values are improved by a butterworth filter. as a result, the asc suppressed the sensor noise 20 times more than the conventionally coupled sensor with the robot joint. finally, we developed a prototype of the 7-dof exoskeleton (asc-exo) using asc for smooth human motion tracking. the performance evaluation of asc and human motion tracking is presented. in addition, we demonstrated the smooth control of the secondary robot (kuka) using the exoskeleton (asc-exo) as a primary device. video: https://youtu.be/hbmab2fbabw.",AB_0510
"the identification of xenobiotic biotransformation products is crucial for delineating toxicity and carcinogenicity that might be caused by xenobiotic exposures and for establishing monitoring systems for public health. however, the lack of available reference standards and spectral data leads to the generation of multiple candidate structures during identification and reduces the confidence in identification. here, a uhplc-hrms-based metabolomics strategy integrated with a metabolite structure elucidation approach, namely, fragassembler, was proposed to reduce the number of false-positive structure candidates. biotransformation product candidates were filtered by mass defect filtering (mdf) and multiple-group comparison. fragassembler assembled fragment signatures from the ms/ms spectra and generated the modified moieties corresponding to the identified biotransformation products. the feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by the three biotransformation products of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (dehp). comprehensive identification was carried out, and 24 and 13 biotransformation products of two xenobiotics, dehp and 4'-methoxy-a-pyrrolidinopentiophenone (4-meo-a-pvp), were annotated, respectively. the number of 4-meo-a-pvp biotransformation product candidates in the fragassembler calculation results was approximately 2.1 times lower than that generated by biotransformer 3.0. our study indicates that the proposed approach has great potential for efficiently and reliably identifying xenobiotic biotransformation products, which is attributed to the fact that fragassembler eliminates false-positive reactions and chemical structures and distinguishes modified moieties on isomeric biotransformation products. the fragassembler software and associated tutorial are freely available at https://cosbi.ee.ncku.edu.tw/fragassembler/ and the source code can be found at https://github.com/yuanchihchen/fragassembler.",AB_0510
"hypothyroidism is the commonest endocrine disorder of pregnancy, with known adverse feto-maternal outcomes. there is limited data on population-based prevalence, risk factors and outcomes associated with treatment of hypothyroidism in early pregnancy. we conducted analysis on data from an urban and peri-urban low to mid socioeconomic population-based cohort of pregnant women in north delhi, india to ascertain the burden, risk factors and impact of treatment, on adverse pregnancy outcomes- low birth weight, prematurity, small for gestational age and stillbirth. this is an observational study embedded within the intervention group of the women and infants integrated interventions for growth study, an individually randomized factorial design trial. thyroid stimulating hormone was tested in 2317 women in early (9-13 weeks) pregnancy, and thyroxin replacement started hypothyroid (tsh & ge;2.5miu/ml). univariable and multivariable generalized linear model with binomial family and log link were performed to ascertain risk factors associated with hypothyroidism and association between hypothyroidism and adverse pregnancy outcomes. of 2317 women, 29.2% (95% ci: 27.4 to 31.1) had hypothyroidism and were started on thyroxin replacement with close monitoring. overweight or obesity was associated with increased risk (adjusted rr 1.29, 95% ci 1.10 to 1.51), while higher hemoglobin concentration was associated with decreased risk (adjusted rr 0.93, 95% ci 0.88 to 0.98 for each g/dl) for hypothyroidism. hypothyroid women received appropriate treatment with no increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. almost a third of women from low to mid socio-economic population had hypothyroidism in early pregnancy, more so if anemic and overweight or obese. with early screening and adequate replacement, adverse pregnancy outcomes may be avoided. these findings highlight the need in early pregnancy for universal tsh screening and adequate treatment of hypothyroidism; as well as for attempts to reduce pre and peri-conception overweight, obesity and anemia.clinical trial registration: clinical trial registration of women and infants integrated interventions for growth study clinical trial registry-india, #ctri/2017/06/008908; registered on: 23/06/2017, (http://ctri.nic.in/clinicaltrials/pmaindet2.php?trialid=19339 & enchid=& username=society%20for%20applied%20studies).",AB_0510
