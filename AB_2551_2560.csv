"medical anomaly detection is a crucial yet challenging task aimed at recognizing abnormal images to assist in diagnosis. due to the high-cost annotations of abnormal images, most methods utilize only known normal images during training and identify samples deviating from the normal profile as anomalies in the testing phase. many readily available unlabeled images containing anomalies are thus ignored in the training phase, restricting the performance. to solve this problem, we introduce one-class semi-supervised learning (oc-ssl) to utilize known normal and unlabeled images for training, and propose dual-distribution discrepancy for anomaly detection (ddad) based on this setting. ensembles of reconstruction networks are designed to model the distribution of normal images and the distribution of both normal and unlabeled images, deriving the normative distribution module (ndm) and unknown distribution module (udm). subsequently, the intra-discrepancy of ndm and inter-discrepancy between the two modules are designed as anomaly scores. furthermore, we propose a new perspective on self-supervised learning, which is designed to refine the anomaly scores rather than directly detect anomalies. five medical datasets, including chest x-rays, brain mris and retinal fundus images, are organized as benchmarks for evaluation. experiments on these benchmarks comprehensively compare a wide range of anomaly detection methods and demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains and outperforms the state-of-the-art. code and organized benchmarks are available at https://github.com/caiyu6666/ddad-asr.",AB_0256
"visual inspection of the appearance defects on industrial products has always been a research hotspot pursued by industry and academia. due to the lack of samples in the industrial defect dataset and the serious class imbalance, deep learning technology cannot be directly applied to industrial defect visual inspection to meet the real application needs. transfer learning is a good choice to deal with insufficient samples. however, cross-dataset bias is unavoidable during simple knowledge transfer. we noticed that the appearance defects of industrial products are similar, and most defects can be classified as stains or texture jumps, which provides a research basis for building a universal and adaptive industrial defect detection model. in this article, based on the idea of model-agnostic meta-learning (maml), we propose an adaptive industrial defect detection model through learning from multiple known industrial defect datasets and then transfer it to the novel anomaly detection tasks. in addition, the siamese network is used to extract differential features to minimize the influence of defect types on model generalization, and can also highlight defect features and improve model detection performance. at the same time, we add a coordinate attention mechanism to the model, which realizes the feature enhancement of the region of interest in terms of two coordinate dimensions. in the simulation experiments, we construct and publish a visual defect dataset of injection molded bottle cups, termed bc defects, which can complement existing industrial defect visual data benchmarks. simulation results based on bc defects dataset and other public datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed general visual detection model for industrial defects. the dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zhg-szpt/medetection.",AB_0256
"gene essentiality is defined as the extent to which a gene is required for the survival and reproductive success of a living system. it can vary between genetic backgrounds and environments. essential protein coding genes have been well studied. however, the essentiality of non-coding regions is rarely reported. most regions of human genome do not encode proteins. determining essentialities of non-coding genes is demanded. we developed iesslnc models, which can assign essentiality scores to lncrna genes. as far as we know, this is the first direct quantitative estimation to the essentiality of lncrna genes. by taking the advantage of graph neural network with meta-path-guided random walks on the lncrna-protein interaction network, iesslnc models can perform genome-wide screenings for essential lncrna genes in a quantitative manner. we carried out validations and whole genome screening in the context of human cancer cell-lines and mouse genome. in comparisons to other methods, which are transferred from protein-coding genes, iesslnc achieved better performances. enrichment analysis indicated that iesslnc essentiality scores clustered essential lncrna genes with high ranks. with the screening results of iesslnc models, we estimated the number of essential lncrna genes in human and mouse. we performed functional analysis to find that essential lncrna genes interact with micrornas and cytoskeletal proteins significantly, which may be of interest in experimental life sciences. all datasets and codes of iesslnc models have been deposited in github (https://github.com/yyzhang14/iesslnc).",AB_0256
"event extraction (ee) is an essential and challenging task in information extraction. most existing event extraction methods do not specifically target the chinese geological hazards domain. this is due to the unique characteristics of the chinese language and the lack of chinese geological hazard datasets. to address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-word lexical feature enhancement framework (mfee). it effectively imple-ments chinese event extraction in the geological hazard domain by introducing lexical information and the designed lexical feature weighting decision method. in addition, we construct a large-scale chinese geological hazard dataset (cghaz). experimental results on this dataset and the ace 2005 dataset demonstrate the approach's effectiveness. the datasets can be found at https://github.com/jiegong1130/mfee-dataset. the code can be found at https://github.com/jiegong1130/mfee-master.",AB_0256
"objective: living kidney donors (lkds) experience perioperative anxiety. we designed the following study to evaluate the anxiolytic effect of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (teas) during the perioperative period in a group of lkds undergoing laparotomy nephrectomy.methods: lkds were randomly assigned to either the teas or control group. participants in the teas group received 30min of intervention (6-15 ma, 2-100 hz), at yintang (ex-hn-3), bilateral taichong (lr3) and neiguan (pc6) one day before surgery (d0), before induction of anesthesia (d1) and one day after surgery (d2). the participants in the control group received the same placement of electrodes but without electrical stimulation. venous blood was collected before each intervention. anxiety levels and recovery profiles were recorded.results: lkds in the teas group had lower anxiety level than those in the control group at d1, d2 and three days after surgery (d3). the percentage differences were: 33.3%, 25.0%, and 22.2%; [95% confidence interval (ci), (-55.1%, -11.6%), (-47.4%, -2.6%), and (-42.3%, -2.2%); p = 0.005, p = 0.034, and p = 0.035; respectively]. lkds who received teas had better sleep quality and short-term recovery profiles than those in the control group. the plasma levels of 5hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) and melatonin (mt) in the teas group were significantly higher than those in the control group at d1 and d2 (5-ht: p = 0.001, and p < 0.001; mt: p = 0.006, and p = 0.001). at the 3-month follow up, fewer lkds in the teas group had incisional pain when compared to the control group (p = 0.032).conclusions: perioperative teas decreased perioperative anxiety and facilitated postoperative recovery in the lkds, and potential decreased the development of chronic pain. trial registration: registered at chictr2000029891, http://www.chictr.org.cn/listbycreater.aspx.",AB_0256
"although extensive researches have carried out on visible and infrared images fusion, quality assessment of the fused image is still challenging due to the absence of the reference image. in this paper, a subjective benchmark dataset and a semi-reference objective assessment method based on a transformer encoder-decoder framework named semantic-relation transformer (srt), are developed for visible and infrared fused image quality assessment (vif-iqa). different with existing transformers, srt decoder can extract multi-level source image features and adopts a multi-head self-evaluation (mhse) block which is constructed to mine latent relation knowledge between the fused image and source images. the relation knowledge is then injected into 3d-token with deep semantic embedding of receptive regions. finally, the objective assessment score is obtained from-token through linear mapping of local to global. moreover, we meticulously select 4,000 fused images from 200 scenes in tno, msrs, m3fd and road scene datasets and create a visible and infrared fused quality assessment (vista) dataset, which is guided by subjective vif-iqa specification rigorously. vista dataset is utilized to comprehensively validate the proposed srt. the experimental results demonstrated that the output of srt is more in keeping with subjective feelings. moreover, srt has state-of-the-art performance on quantitative metrics when compared with 12 popular methods and the output of srt is more in keeping with subjective feelings. vista dataset is available at https://github.com/changezh/vista-dataset.",AB_0256
"accurate skin lesion segmentation is of great significance for improving the quantitative analysis of skin cancer. however, due to the irregular shapes and ambiguous boundaries of lesions, automatic segmentation is still very difficult. although the emergence of cnn and transformer hybrid models recently complements their respective shortcomings, the use of transformer results in heavy parameters, and the complex structure requires a lot of data and resources for training. in contrast, multi-layer perceptron (mlp) is a cost-effective alternative to complex self-attention. to this end, we propose an mlp-based model using matrix decomposition and rolling tensors for skin lesion segmentation. specifically, we can dynamically calculate the correlation matrix according to the size of the input image and use it as the weight to guide the segmentation. the way of rolling tensors can fully mix the feature information and sequentially extract the information under different receptive fields. we also employ a two-layer decoding structure using matrix decomposition to fuse the feature extracted in the parallel mlp encoders. extensive experiments are conducted on the public skin disease datasets isic2016, isic2017, isic2018 and ph2. after comparison, we found that although the addition of transformer makes up for the lack of global information on cnn, the complex structure of transformer itself will lead to huge parameters and is difficult to train. the experimental results show that we achieved higher results with fewer parameters compared to other state-of-the-art models which mean that the self-attention mechanism of transformer is not irreplaceable. our code is released at https://github.com/lingglesymphony/rmmlp.",AB_0256
"the adaptive immune receptor repertoire (airr), consisting of t- and b-cell receptors, is the core component of the immune system. the airr sequencing is commonly used in cancer immunotherapy and minimal residual disease (mrd) detection of leukemia and lymphoma. the airr is captured by primers and sequenced to yield paired-end (pe) reads. the pe reads could be merged into one sequence by the overlapped region between them. however, the wide range of airr data raises the difficulty, so a special tool is required. we developed a software package for immune pe reads merger of sequencing data, named imperm. we used the k-mer-and-vote strategy to pin down the overlapped region rapidly. imperm could handle all types of pe reads, eliminate adapter contamination and successfully merge low-quality and minor/non-overlapping reads. compared with existing tools, imperm performed better in both simulated and sequencing data. notably, imperm was well suited to processing the data of mrd detection in leukemia and lymphoma and detected 19 novel mrd clones in 14 patients with leukemia from previously published data. additionally, imperm can handle pe reads from other sources, and we demonstrated its effectiveness on two genomic and one cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid datasets. imperm is implemented in the c programming language and consumes little runtime and memory. it is freely available at . https://github.com/ zhangwei2015/imperm.",AB_0256
"neuropeptides are a diverse and complex class of signaling molecules that regulate a variety of biological processes. neuropeptides provide many opportunities for the discovery of new drugs and targets for the treatment of a wide range of diseases, and thus, computational tools for the rapid and accurate large-scale identification of neuropeptides are of great significance for peptide research and drug development. although several machine learning-based prediction tools have been developed, there is room for improvement in the performance and interpretability of the proposed methods. in this work, we developed an interpretable and robust neuropeptide prediction model, named neuropred-plm. first, we employed a language model (esm) of proteins to obtain semantic representations of neuropeptides, which could reduce the complexity of feature engineering. next, we adopted a multi-scale convolutional neural network to enhance the local feature representation of neuropeptide embeddings. to make the model interpretable, we proposed a global multi-head attention network that could be used to capture the position-wise contribution to neuropeptide prediction via the attention scores. in addition, neuropred-plm was developed based on our newly constructed neuropep 2.0 database. benchmarks based on the independent test set show that neuropred-plm achieves superior predictive performance compared with other state-of-the-art predictors. for the convenience of researchers, we provide an easy-to-install pypi package (https://pypi.org/project/neuropredplm/) and a web server (https://huggingface.co/spaces/isyslab/neuropred-plm).",AB_0256
"background: covalent drugs have been intentionally discarded historically due to the concern of off-target side effects, but the past decade has seen a fast resurgence of the discovery of covalent drugs. compared to noncovalent ligands, covalent ligands might have better biochemical efficiency, lower patient burden, less dosing frequency, less drug resistance, and improved target specificity. results: previously, we proposed the steric-clashes alleviating receptor (scar) strategy for screening and repurposing covalent inhibitors. to help the discovery of covalent ligands targeting protein targets, we have developed a web server dedicated to providing the scardock protocol to general users. along with this server, we presented three high-quality data sets for the discovery of covalent ligands: a manually curated data set containing 954 high-quality complex structures of covalent ligands and proteins, a manually curated data set of 68 experimentally confirmed covalent warheads targeting 11 different residues, and a prefiltered, classified, and ready-to-use data set of 690,018 entries of purchasable virtual compounds containing these experimentally verified warheads. conclusions: the scardock server and the accompanied data sets would be of great value to the discovery of covalent ligands and are available freely at http://www.liugroup.site/scardock/ or https://scardock.com.",AB_0256
