"dataset auditing for machine learning (ml) models is a method to evaluate if a given dataset is used in training a model. in a federated learning setting where multiple institutions collaboratively train a model with their decentralized private datasets, dataset auditing can facilitate the enforcement of regulations, which provide rules for preserving privacy, but also allow users to revoke authorizations and remove their data from collaboratively trained models. this paper first proposes a set of requirements for a practical dataset auditing method, and then present a novel dataset auditing method called ensembled membership auditing (ema). its key idea is to leverage previously proposed membership inference attack methods and to aggregate data-wise membership scores using statistic testing to audit a dataset for a ml model. we have experimentally evaluated the proposed approach with benchmark datasets, as well as 4 x-ray datasets (cbis-ddsm, covidx, child-xray, and cxr-nih) and 3 dermatology datasets (derm7pt, ham10000, and pad-ufes-20). our results show that ema meet the requirements substantially better than the previous state-of-the-art method. our code is at:https://github.com/hazelsuko07/ema.",AB_0463
"in the last decade, the explosive growth of vision sensors and video content has driven numerous application demands for automating human action detection in space and time. aside from reliable precision, vast real -world scenarios also mandate continuous and instantaneous processing of actions under limited computational budgets. however, existing studies often rely on heavy operations such as 3d convolution and fine-grained optical flow, therefore are hindered in practical deployment. aiming strictly at a better mixture of detection accuracy, speed, and complexity for online detection, we customize a cost-effective 2d-cnn-based tubelet detection framework coined accumulated micro-motion action detector (amma). it sparsely extracts and fuses visual-dynamic cues of actions spanning a longer temporal window. to lift reliance on expensive optical flow estimation, amma efficiently encodes actions' short-term dynamics as accumulated micro-motion from rgb frames on-the-fly. on top of amma's motion-aware 2d backbone, we adopt an anchor-free detector to cooperatively model action instances as moving points in the time span. the proposed action detector achieves highly competitive accuracy as state-of-the-arts while substantially reducing model size, computational cost, and processing time (6 million parameters, 1 gmacs, and 100 fps respectively), making it much more appealing under stringent speed and computational constraints. codes are available on https://github.com/ alphadadajuju/amma.",AB_0463
"motivation: interpretable deep learning (dl) models that can provide biological insights, in addition to accurate predictions, are of great interest to the biomedical community. recently, interpretable dl models that incorporate signaling pathways have been proposed for drug response prediction (drp). while these models improve interpretability, it is unclear whether this comes at the cost of less accurate drps, or a prediction improvement can also be obtained. results: we comprehensively and systematically assessed four state-of-the-art interpretable dl models using three pathway collections to assess their ability in making accurate predictions on unseen samples from the same dataset, as well as their generalizability to an independent dataset. our results showed that models that explicitly incorporate pathway information in the form of a latent layer perform worse compared to models that incorporate this information implicitly. however, in most evaluation setups, the best performance was achieved using a black-box multilayer perceptron, and the performance of a random forests baseline was comparable to those of the interpretable models. replacing the signaling pathways with randomly generated pathways showed a comparable performance for the majority of the models. finally, the performance of all models deteriorated when applied to an independent dataset. these results highlight the importance of systematic evaluation of newly proposed models using carefully selected baselines. we provide different evaluation setups and baseline models that can be used to achieve this goal. availability and implementation: implemented models and datasets are provided at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7787178 and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7101665, respectively.",AB_0463
"identifying the common structural elements of functionally related rna sequences (family) is usually based on an alignment of the sequences, which is often subject to human bias and may not be accurate. the resulting covariance model (cm) provides probabilities for each base to covary with another, which allows to support evolutionarily the formation of double helical regions and possibly pseudoknots. the coexistence of alternative folds in rna, resulting from its dynamic nature, may lead to the potential omis-sion of motifs by cm. to overcome this limitation, we present d-orb, a system of algorithms that iden-tifies overrepresented motifs in the secondary conformational landscapes of a family when compared to those of unrelated sequences. the algorithms are bundled into an easy-to-use website allowing users to submit a family, and optionally provide unrelated sequences. d-orb produces a non-pseudoknotted sec-ondary structure based on the overrepresented motifs, a deep neural network classifier and two decision trees. when used to model an rfam family, d-orb fits overrepresented motifs in the corresponding rfam structure; more than a hundred rfam families have been modeled. the statistical approach behind d-orb derives the structural composition of an rna family, making it a valuable tool for analyzing and mod-eling it. its easy-to-use interface and advanced algorithms make it an essential resource for researchers studying rna structure. d-orb is available at https://d-orb.major.iric.ca/.& copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://crea-tivecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0463
"advancements in satellite-based forest monitoring increasingly enable the near real-time detection of small-scale tropical forest disturbances. however, there is an urgent need to enhance such monitoring methods with automated direct driver attributions to detected disturbances. this would provide important additional information to make forest disturbance alerts more actionable and useful for uptake by different stakeholders. in this study, we demonstrate spatially explicit and near real-time methods to monitor direct drivers of small-scale tropical forest disturbance across a range of tropical forest conditions in suriname, the republic of the congo and the democratic republic of the congo. we trained a convolutional neural network with sentinel-1 and sentinel-2 data to continuously classify newly detected radar for detecting deforestation (radd) alerts as smallholder agriculture, road development, selective logging, mining or other. different monitoring scenarios were evaluated based on varying sensor combinations, post-disturbance time periods and confidence levels. in general, the use of sentinel-2 data was found to be most accurate for driver classifications, especially with data composited over a period of 4 to 6 months after the disturbance detection. sentinel-1 data showed to be valuable for more rapid classifications of specific drivers, especially in areas with persistent cloud cover. throughout all monitoring scenarios, smallholder agriculture was classified most accurately, while road development, selective logging and mining were more challenging to distinguish. an accuracy assessment throughout the full extent of our study regions revealed a macro-f1 score of 0.861 and an overall accuracy of 0.897 for the best performing model, based on the use of 6-month post-disturbance sentinel-2 composites. finally, we addressed three specific monitoring use cases that relate to rapid law enforcement against illegal activities, ecological impact assessments and timely carbon emission reporting, by optimizing the trade-off in classification timeliness and confidence to reach required accuracies. our findings demonstrate the strong capacities of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite data for monitoring direct drivers of small-scale forest disturbance, considering different user interests. the produced forest disturbance driver maps can be accessed via: https://bartslagter94.users.earthengine.app/vi ew/forest-disturbance-drivers.",AB_0463
"spermatogenesis is a highly specialized process of cellproliferationand differentiation leading to the production of spermatozoa fromspermatogonial stem cells. due to its testicular anatomy, scyliorhinus canicula is an interesting model toexplore stage-based changes in proteins during spermatogenesis. theproteomes of four testicular zones corresponding to the germinativeniche and to spermatocysts (cysts) with spermatogonia (zone a), cystswith spermatocytes (zone b), cysts with young spermatids (zone c),and cysts with late spermatids (zone d) have been analyzed by nanolc-esi-ms/ms.gene ontology and kegg annotations were also performed. a total of3346 multiple protein groups were identified. zone-specific proteinanalyses highlighted rna-processing, chromosome-related processes,cilium organization, and cilium activity in zones a, d, c, and d,respectively. analyses of proteins with zone-dependent abundance revealedprocesses related to cellular stress, ubiquitin-dependent degradationby the proteasome, post-transcriptional regulation, and regulationof cellular homeostasis. our results also suggest that the roles ofsome proteins, such as ceruloplasmin, optineurin, the pregnancy zoneprotein, pa28 beta or the culling-ring ligase 5 complex, as wellas some uncharacterized proteins, during spermatogenesis could befurther explored. finally, the study of this shark species allowsone to integrate these data in an evolutionary context of the regulationof spermatogenesis. mass spectrometry data are freely accessible viaiprox-integrated proteome resources (https://www.iprox.cn/) for reuse purposes.",AB_0463
"magnetic resonance (mr) and computer tomography (ct) imaging are valuable tools for diagnosing diseases and planning treatment. however, limitations such as radiation exposure and cost can restrict access to certain imaging modalities. to address this issue, medical image synthesis can generate one modality from another, but many existing models struggle with high-quality image synthesis when multiple slices are present in the dataset. this study proposes an attention-based dual contrast generative model, called adc-cyclegan, which can synthesize medical images from unpaired data with multiple slices. the model integrates a dual contrast loss term with the cyclegan loss to ensure that the synthesized images are distinguishable from the source domain. additionally, an attention mechanism is incorporated into the generators to extract informative features from both channel and spatial domains. to improve performance when dealing with multiple slices, the k-means algorithm is used to cluster the dataset into k groups, and each group is used to train a separate adc-cyclegan. experimental results demonstrate that the proposed adc-cyclegan model produces comparable samples to other state-ofthe-art generative models, achieving the highest psnr and ssim values of 19.04385 and 0.68551, respectively. we publish the code at https://github.com/jiayuanwang-jw/adc-cyclegan.",AB_0463
"magnetic resonance (mr) and computer tomography (ct) images are two typical types of medical images that provide mutually-complementary information for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment. however, obtaining both images may be limited due to some considerations such as cost, radiation dose and modality missing. recently, medical image synthesis has aroused gaining research interest to cope with this limitation. in this paper, we propose a bidirectional learning model, denoted as dual contrast cyclegan (dc-cyclegan), to synthesize medical images from unpaired data. specifically, a dual contrast loss is introduced into the discriminators to indirectly build constraints between real source and synthetic images by taking advantage of samples from the source domain as negative samples and enforce the synthetic images to fall far away from the source domain. in addition, cross-entropy and structural similarity index (ssim) are integrated into the dc-cyclegan in order to consider both the luminance and structure of samples when synthesizing images. the experimental results indicate that dc-cyclegan is able to produce promising results as compared with other cyclegan-based medical image synthesis methods such as cyclegan, reggan, dualgan, and nicegan. code is available at https://github.com/jiayuanwang-jw/dc-cyclegan.",AB_0463
"background: protein-dna binding sites of chip-seq experiments are identified where the binding affinity is significant based on a given threshold. the choice of the threshold is a trade-off between conservative region identification and discarding weak, but true binding sites. results: we rescue weak binding sites using mspc, which efficiently exploits replicates to lower the threshold required to identify a site while keeping a low false-positive rate, and we compare it to idr, a widely used post-processing method for identifying highly reproducible peaks across replicates. we observe several master transcription regulators (e.g., sp1 and gata3) and hdac2-gata1 regulatory networks on rescued regions in k562 cell line. conclusions: we argue the biological relevance of weak binding sites and the information they add when rescued by mspc. an implementation of the proposed extended mspc methodology and the scripts to reproduce the performed analysis are freely available at https://genometric.github.io/mspc/; mspc is distributed as a command-line application and an r package available from bioconductor (https://doi. org/doi:10.18129/b9.bioc.rmspc).",AB_0463
"highway traffic state data collected from a network of sensors can be considered as a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. in this paper, we develop a novel data-driven method-anti-circulant dynamic mode decomposition with sparsity-promoting (circdmdsp)-to study the dynamics of highway traffic speed data. particularly, circdmdsp addresses several issues that hinder the application of existing dmd models: limited spatial dimension, presence of both recurrent and non-recurrent patterns, high level of noise, and known mode stability. the proposed circdmdsp framework allows us to numerically extract spatial-temporal coherent structures with physical meanings/interpretations: the dynamic modes reflect coherent spatial bases, and the corresponding temporal patterns capture the temporal oscillation/evolution of these dynamic modes. our result based on seattle highway loop detector data showcases that traffic speed data is governed by a set of periodic components, e.g., mean pattern, daily pattern, and weekly pattern, and each of them has a unique spatial structure. the spatiotemporal patterns can also be used to recover/denoise observed data and predict future values at any timestamp by extrapolating the temporal vandermonde matrix. our experiments also demonstrate that the proposed circdmdsp framework is more accurate and robust in data reconstruction and prediction than other dmd-based models. the code for the algorithm and experiment is available at https://github.com/mcgill-smart-transport/circdmdsp.",AB_0463
