"the reactome knowledgebase (https://reactome.org), an elixir and gcbr core biological data resource, provides manually curated molecular details of a broad range of normal and disease-related biological processes. processes are annotated as an ordered network of molecular transformations in a single consistent data model. reactome thus functions both as a digital archive of manually curated human biological processes and as a tool for discovering functional relationships in data such as gene expression profiles or somatic mutation catalogs from tumor cells. here we review progress towards annotation of the entire human proteome, targeted annotation of disease-causing genetic variants of proteins and of small-molecule drugs in a pathway context, and towards supporting explicit annotation of cell- and tissue-specific pathways. finally, we briefly discuss issues involved in making reactome more fully interoperable with other related resources such as the gene ontology and maintaining the resulting community resource network. graphical abstract",AB_0418
"backgroundcalcimimetic therapy with etelcalcetide (etel) has been shown to attenuate the advancement of left ventricular (lv) hypertrophy in hemodialysis patients measured by cardiac magnetic resonance (cmr). the aim of the study was to evaluate whether this effect is accompanied by alterations in lv function and myocardial composition.methodsthis was a post-hoc analysis of a randomized-controlled trial of etel versus alfacalcidol (alfa) in 62 hemodialysis patients. lv function was assessed using lv ejection fraction (lvef) and lv global longitudinal strain (gls) on feature-tracking (ft) cmr. myocardial tissue characteristics were analyzed using parametric t1 and t2 mapping.resultsof the total study cohort (n = 62), 48 subjects completed both cmr scans with sufficient quality for ft analysis. in the one-year follow-up, lv gls deteriorated in the alfa group, whereas the etel group remained stable (lv gls change: + 2.6 +/- 4.6 versus + 0.3 +/- 3.8; p = 0.045 when adjusting for randomization factors and baseline lv gls). we did not observe a difference in the change of lvef between the two groups (p = 0.513). the impact of etel treatment on lv gls over time remained significant after additional adjustment for the change in lv mass during the study period. etel treatment did not significantly affect other cmr parameters. there were no changes in myocardial composition between treatment groups (t1 time change: + 15 +/- 42 versus + 10 +/- 50; p = 0.411; t2 time change: - 0.13 +/- 2.45 versus - 0.70 +/- 2.43; p = 0.652).conclusionsin patients undergoing hemodialysis, treatment with etel was protective against deterioration of lv longitudinal function, as evaluated through ft cmr, when compared to the control therapy of alfa. this effect was not mediated by the change in lv mass.trial registration url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03182699. unique identifier: nct03182699.conclusionsin patients undergoing hemodialysis, treatment with etel was protective against deterioration of lv longitudinal function, as evaluated through ft cmr, when compared to the control therapy of alfa. this effect was not mediated by the change in lv mass.trial registration url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03182699. unique identifier: nct03182699.",AB_0418
"we propose a novel learned keypoint detection method to increase the number of correct matches for the task of non-rigid image correspondence. by leveraging true correspondences acquired by matching annotated image pairs with a specified descriptor extractor, we train an end-to-end convolutional neural network (cnn) to find keypoint locations that are more appropriate to the considered descriptor. experiments demonstrate that our method enhances the mean matching accuracy of numerous descriptors when used in conjunction with our detection method, while outperforming the state-of-the-art keypoint detectors on real images of non-rigid objects by 20 p.p. we also apply our method on the complex real-world task of object retrieval where our detector performs on par with the finest keypoint detectors currently available for this task. the source code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/verlab/learningtodetect_prl_2023.",AB_0418
"background multimodal prehabilitation is a promising adjunct to the current surgical treatment pathway for colorectal cancer patients to further improve postoperative outcomes, especially for high-risk patients with low functional capacity. the aim of the present study was to test the effect of prehabilitation on immediate postoperative recovery.method the study was designed as a rct with two arms (intervention and control). the intervention consisted of 4 weeks of multimodal prehabilitation, with supervised physical training, nutritional support and medical optimization. the control group received standard of care. a total of 40 patients with colorectal cancer (who performance status i or ii) undergoing elective surgery with curative intent were included. the primary outcome was postoperative recovery within the first 3 postoperative days, measured by quality of recovery-15, a validated questionnaire with a scoring range between 0 and 150 and a minimal clinically relevant difference of 8.results in total, 36 patients were analysed with 16 in the intervention group and 20 in the control group. the mean age of the included patients was 79 years. the overall treatment effect associated with the intervention was a 21.9 (95% c.i. 4.5-39.3) higher quality of recovery-15 score during the first 3 postoperative days compared to control, well above the minimal clinically relevant difference.conclusion four weeks of multimodal prehabilitation prior to elective curative intended colorectal cancer surgery in patients with who performance status i or ii was associated with a clinically relevant improvement in postoperative recovery. registration number: nct04167436 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov)conclusion four weeks of multimodal prehabilitation prior to elective curative intended colorectal cancer surgery in patients with who performance status i or ii was associated with a clinically relevant improvement in postoperative recovery. registration number: nct04167436 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) in this randomized clinical trial comparing patients undergoing 4 weeks of multimodal prehabilitation prior to elective colorectal cancer surgery with usual care, prehabilitation was associated with a clinically relevant improvement in postoperative recovery. the overall treatment effect associated with the intervention was an improvement in the quality of recovery-15 score of 21.9 (95% c.i. 4.5-39.3) during the first 3 postoperative days compared to control.",AB_0418
"while space-borne optical and near-infrared facilities have succeeded in delivering a precise and spatially resolved picture of our universe, their small survey area is known to underrepresent the true diversity of galaxy populations. ground-based surveys have reached comparable depths but at lower spatial resolution, resulting in source confusion that hampers accurate photometry extractions. what once was limited to the infrared regime has now begun to challenge ground-based ultradeep surveys, affecting detection and photometry alike. failing to address these challenges will mean forfeiting a representative view into the distant universe. we introduce the farmer: an automated, reproducible profile-fitting photometry package that pairs a library of smooth parametric models from the tractor with a decision tree that determines the best-fit model in concert with neighboring sources. photometry is measured by fitting the models on other bands leaving brightness free to vary. the resulting photometric measurements are naturally total, and no aperture corrections are required. supporting diagnostics (e.g., chi(2)) enable measurement validation. as fitting models is relatively time intensive, the farmer is built with high-performance computing routines. we benchmark the farmer on a set of realistic cosmos-like images and find accurate photometry, number counts, and galaxy shapes. the farmer is already being utilized to produce catalogs for several large-area deep extragalactic surveys where it has been shown to tackle some of the most challenging optical and near-infrared data available, with the promise of extending to other ultradeep surveys expected in the near future. the farmer is available to download from github (https://github.com/astroweaver/the_farmer) and zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8205817).",AB_0418
"super-resolution (sr) is a powerful technique for enhancing the quality of remote sensing imagery, which in turn can improve the accuracy of various computer vision tasks, such as object detection, classification, and segmentation. deep convolutional neural networks (cnns) have demonstrated significant progress in this field, and attention mechanisms are widely adopted in deep cnns as they allow the models to assign weights to important areas within the feature map. in this paper, we propose the channel-wise gated attention (cga) module, which integrates attention across the feature map channels and scales the resulting feature map through a gating parameter, leading to performance improvements. furthermore, we present an sr framework that employs multiple attention blocks, with the cga module serving as the core of each block, to enhance the spatial resolution of remote sensing imagery. our proposed network, the channel-wise gated attention network (cga-net), outperforms other attention-based deep sr models for 4x- and 8x-upsampling on two remote sensing datasets: satellite imagery multi-vehicles dataset (simd), consisting of 5000 high-resolution remote sensing images, and dota, a large-scale satellite imagery dataset. we conduct several experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our sr framework for object detection on the simd dataset. the code and trained weights for the proposed framework can be found at this link: https://github.com/vision-at-seecs/cga-net.",AB_0418
"here, we present an expanded utility of the r package qgg for genetic analyses of complex traits and diseases. one of the major updates of the package is, that it now includes bayesian linear regression modeling procedures, which provide a unified framework for mapping of genetic variants, estimation of heritability and genomic prediction from either individual level data or from genome-wide association study summary data. with this release, the qgg package now provides a wealth of the commonly used methods in analysis of complex traits and diseases, without the need to switch between software and data formats. availability and implementation: the methodologies are implemented in the publicly available r software package, qgg, using fast and memory efficient algorithms in c++ and is available on cran or as a developer version at our github page (https://github.com/psoerensen/qgg). notes on the implemented statistical genetic models, tutorials and example scripts are available at our github page https://psoerensen.github.io/qgg/.",AB_0418

"objective intrinsic function is indispensable for dexterous hand movements. distal ulnar nerve defects can result in intrinsic muscle dysfunction and sensory deficits. although the ulnar nerve's fascicular anatomy has been extensively studied, quantitative and topographic data on motor axons traveling within this nerve remain elusive. methods the ulnar nerves of 14 heart-beating organ donors were evaluated. the motor branches to the flexor carpi ulnaris (fcu) and flexor digitorum profundus (fdp) muscles and the dorsal branch (dobun) as well as 3 segments of the ulnar nerve were harvested in 2-cm increments. samples were subjected to double immunofluorescence staining using antibodies against choline acetyltransferase and neurofilament. results samples revealed more than 25,000 axons in the ulnar nerve at the forearm level, with a motor axon propor-tion of only 5%. the superficial and dobun showed high axon numbers of more than 21,000 and 9300, respectively. the axonal mapping of more than 1300 motor axons revealed an increasing motor/sensory ratio from the proximal ulnar nerve (1:20) to the deep branch of the ulnar nerve (1:7). the motor branches (fdp and fcu) showed that sensory axons outnumber motor axons by a ratio of 10:1. conclusions knowledge of the detailed axonal architecture of the motor and sensory components of the human ulnar nerve is of the utmost importance for surgeons considering fascicular grafting or nerve transfer surgery. the low number of efferent axons in motor branches of the ulnar nerve and their distinct topographical distribution along the distal course of the nerve is indispensable information for modern nerve surgery. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2023.2.jns23180",AB_0418
"recent advances in language representation using neural networks have made it viable to transfer the learned internal states of large pretrained language models (lms) to downstream natural language processing (nlp) tasks. this transfer learning approach improves the overall performance on many tasks and is highly beneficial when labeled data is scarce, making pretrained lms valuable resources specially for languages with few annotated training examples. in this work, we train bert (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) models for brazilian portuguese, which we nickname bertimbau. we evaluate our models on three downstream nlp tasks: sentence textual similarity, recognizing textual entailment, and named entity recognition. our models improve the state-of-the-art in all of these tasks, outperforming multilingual bert and confirming the effectiveness of large pretrained lms for portuguese. we release our models to the community hoping to provide strong baselines for future nlp research: https://github.com/neuralmind-ai/portuguese-bert.",AB_0418
