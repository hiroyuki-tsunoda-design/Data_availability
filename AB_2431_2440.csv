"micrornas (mirnas) are a family of non-coding rna molecules with vital roles in regulating gene expression. although researchers have recognized the importance of mirnas in the development of human diseases, it is very resource-consuming to use experimental methods for identifying which dysregulated mirna is associated with a specific disease. to reduce the cost of human effort, a growing body of studies has leveraged computational methods for predicting the potential mirna-disease associations. however, the extant computational methods usually ignore the crucial mediating role of genes and suffer from the data sparsity problem. to address this limitation, we introduce the multi-task learning technique and develop a new model called mtlmda (multi-task learning model for predicting potential microrna-disease associations). different from existing models that only learn from the mirna-disease network, our mtlmda model exploits both mirna-disease and gene-disease networks for improving the identification of mirna- disease associations. to evaluate model performance, we compare our model with competitive baselines on a real-world dataset of experimentally supported mirna-disease associations. empirical results show that our model performs best using various performance metrics. we also examine the effectiveness of model components via ablation study and further showcase the predictive power of our model for six types of common cancers. the data and source code are available from https://github.com/qwslle/mtlmda.",AB_0244
"data-independent acquisition (dia) technology for protein identification from mass spectrometry and related algorithms is developing rapidly. the spectrum-centric analysis of dia data without the use of spectra library from data-dependent acquisition data represents a promising direction. in this paper, we proposed an untargeted analysis method, dear-diaxmbd, for direct analysis of dia data. dear-diaxmbd first integrates the deep variational autoencoder and triplet loss to learn the representations of the extracted fragment ion chromatograms, then uses the k-means clustering algorithm to aggregate fragments with similar representations into the same classes, and finally establishes the inverted index tables to determine the precursors of fragment clusters between precursors and peptides and between fragments and peptides. we show that dear-diaxmbd performs superiorly with the highly complicated dia data of different species obtained by different instrument platforms. dear-diaxmbd is publicly available at https:// github.com/jianweishuai/dear-dia-xmbd.",AB_0244
"background. the anti-mullerian hormone (amh) is gaining attention as a key factor in determining ovarian reserve and polycystic ovarian syndrome, and its clinical applications are becoming more widespread worldwide.objective. to identify the most accurate formula for converting amh assay results between different platforms, so that the developed amh converter can be used to reduce the need for multiple amh tests at different hospitals.methods. assuming that the beckman access, kangrun, and roche elecsys (r) amh assays fit a linear relationship from the lowest to the highest concentration (a global relationship), we used passing-bablok regression to determine the conversion equation between each two assays. when the relationship between two amh assays was a local one, spline regression was used. bland-altman plots were drawn to check systemic bias and heterogeneity of variance across different ranges of values. the fitting effects of the models were evaluated using the squared coefficient of determination (r2), adjusted r2, root mean square error (rmse), akaike information criterion (aic), and corrected aic.results. the coefficient of variance for multiple controls in the kangrun, roche, and beckman assays was lower than 5%, and the bias of multiple controls was lower than 7%. a global linear relationship was observed between the kangrun and roche assays, with the intercept being zero, for which passing-bablok regression was employed for data conversion between the two platforms. for the other two pairs of platforms, i.e., roche and kangrun or beckman and kangrun, spline regression was applied, with the intercepts not including zero. the six corresponding formulas were developed into an online amh converter (http://121.43.113.123:8006/).conclusion. this is the first time passing-bablok plus spline regression has been used to convert amh concentrations from one assay to another. the formulas have been developed into an online tool, which makes them convenient to use in practical applications.",AB_0244
"heavy haze/noise can cause unpleasant information loss in near infrared (nir) and visible (vi) image fusion. to generate high-quality fused images, this paper proposes a detail-aware near infrared and visible image fusion method, which establishes a detail injection variational framework based on multi-order hyper-laplacian priors (mhlp). as the core idea, the mhlp is a ������1/2 norm penalty term with first-order and second-order gradient differences, and applies sparsity-promoting and complete-comprehensive injection terms to enhance salient structures and fine-scale details. besides, a noise map is introduced to suppress the structure inconsistency caused by heavy noise. combining mhlp and a noise map, a novel near infrared and visible fusion framework is organized to deal with harsh environment imaging problems. the framework recovers visual visibility and preserves the significant scenery structural information and intrinsic colors. the video fusion of near infrared and visible also can be realized by the framework, which introduces the inter-frame coherence of successive frames additionally to retain the information lost in the degraded scene. experiment results on public datasets and industrial sites demonstrate the advantages of our method from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. the code is available at: https://github.com/boyang-pro/mhlp.",AB_0244
"background iva xanthiifolia, native to north america, is now widely distributed in northeastern china and has become a vicious invasive plant. this article aims to probe the role of leaf extract in the invasion of i. xanthiifolia. methods we collected the rhizosphere soil of amaranthus tricolor and setaria viridis in the invasive zone, the noninvasive zone and the noninvasive zone treated with extract from i. xanthiifolia leaf, and obtained i. xanthiifolia rhizosphere soil in the invasive zone. all wild plants were identified by xu yongqing. i. xanthiifolia (collection number: rqsb04100), a. tricolor (collection number: 831,030) and s. viridis (collection number: cf-0002-034) are all included in chinese virtual herbarium (https://www.cvh.ac.cn/index.php). the soil bacterial diversity was analyzed based on the illumina hiseq sequencing platform. subsequently, taxonomic analysis and faprotax functional prediction were performed. results the results showed that the leaf extract significantly reduced the diversity of indigenous plant rhizosphere bacteria. a. tricolor and s. viridis rhizobacterial phylum and genus abundances were significantly reduced under the influence of i. xanthiifolia or its leaf extract. the results of functional prediction showed that bacterial abundance changes induced by leaf extracts could potentially hinder nutrient cycling in native plants and increased bacterial abundance in the a. tricolor rhizosphere related to aromatic compound degradation. in addition, the greatest number of sensitive operational taxonomic units (otus) appeared in the rhizosphere when s. viridis was in response to the invasion of i. xanthiifolia. it can be seen that a. tricolor and s. viridis have different mechanisms in response to the invasion of i. xanthiifolia. conclusion i. xanthiifolia leaves material has potential role in invasion by altering indigenous plant rhizosphere bacteria.",AB_0244
"the hippocampus plays a vital role in the diagnosis and treatment of many neurological disorders. recent years, deep learning technology has made great progress in the field of medical image segmentation, and the performance of related tasks has been constantly refreshed. in this article, we focus on the hippocampus segmentation task and propose a novel hierarchical feedback chain network. the feedback chain structure unit learns deeper and wider feature representation of each encoder layer through the hierarchical feature aggregation feedback chains and achieves feature selection and feedback through the feature handover attention module. then, we embed a global pyramid attention unit between the feature encoder and the decoder to further modify the encoder features, including the pairwise pyramid attention module for achieving adjacent attention interaction and the global context modeling module for capturing the long-range knowledge. the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available datasets compared with existing hippocampus segmentation approaches. the code and results can be found from the link of https://github.com/easymoneysniper183/sematic_seg.",AB_0244
"as a vivid and linguistic symbol, emojis have become a prevailing medium interspersed in text-based communication (e.g., social media and chit-chat) to express emotions, attitudes, and situations. generally speaking, a social-oriented chatbot that can generate appropriate emoji-embedded responses would be much more competitive, making communications more fun, engaging, and human-like. however, the current emoji-related research is still in its infancy, leading to an awkward situation of data deficiency. how to develop an emoji-embedded dialogue system while addressing the lack of data will be interesting and meaningful for the application of future ai. to bridge this gap, we propose a multi-task learning method for persona-aware emoji-embedded dialogue generation in this article. specifically, as the benchmark of model training and evaluation, which includes 1.2 million emoji-embedded tweets and 1.1 million post-response pairs, we first construct a dataset named emojitweet to handle the data deficiency problem. then, a seq2seq-based model with multi-task learning is designed to simultaneously learn response generation and emoji embedding from the constructed non-emoji dialogue and emoji-embedded monologue data. afterward, we incorporate persona factors into our model by adopting persona fusion and personalized bias methods to deliver personalized dialogues with more accurately selected emojis. finally, we conduct extensive experiments, where the experimental results and evaluations demonstrate that our model has three key benefits: improved dialogue quality, higher user engagement, and not relying on large-scale emoji-embedded dialogue data representing specific personas. emojitweet will be published publicly via https://mea-lab- 421.github.io/emojitweet/.",AB_0244
"the process of fusing a high spatial resolution (hr) panchromatic (pan) image and a low spatial resolution (lr) multispectral (ms) image to obtain an hrms image is known as pansharpening. with the development of convolutional neural networks (cnns), the performance of pansharpening methods has been improved; however, blurry effects and spectral distortion still exist in their fusion results due to the insufficiency in detail learning and the frequency mismatch between ms and pan. therefore, the improvement of spatial details at the premise of reducing spectral distortion is still a challenge. in this article, we propose a frequency-aware fusion network (fafnet) together with a novel high-frequency feature similarity (hfs) loss to address the above-mentioned problems. fafnet is mainly composed of two kinds of blocks, where the frequency-aware blocks (fabs) aim to extract features in the frequency domain with the help of discrete wavelet transform (dwt) layers, and the frequency fusion blocks (ffbs) reconstruct and transform the features from the frequency domain to the spatial domain with the assistance of inverse dwt (idwt) layers. finally, the fusion results are obtained through a convolutional block (cb). to learn the correspondence, we also propose an hfs loss to constrain the high-frequency (hf) features derived from pan and ms branches, so that hf features of pan can reasonably be used to supplement that of ms. experimental results on three datasets at both reduced and full resolutions demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with several state-of-the-art pansharpening models. the codes are available at https://github.com/yinghuixing/fafnet.",AB_0244
"as the key for biological sequence structure and function prediction, disease diagnosis and treatment, biological sequence similarity analysis has attracted more and more attentions. however, the exiting computational methods failed to accurately analyse the biological sequence similarities because of the various data types (dna, rna, protein, disease, etc) and their low sequence similarities (remote homology). therefore, new concepts and techniques are desired to solve this challenging problem. biological sequences (dna, rna and protein sequences) can be considered as the sentences of the book of life, and their similarities can be considered as the biological language semantics (bls). in this study, we are seeking the semantics analysis techniques derived from the natural language processing (nlp) to comprehensively and accurately analyse the biological sequence similarities. 27 semantics analysis methods derived from nlp were introduced to analyse biological sequence similarities, bringing new concepts and techniques to biological sequence similarity analysis. experimental results show that these semantics analysis methods are able to facilitate the development of protein remote homology detection, circrna-disease associations identification and protein function annotation, achieving better performance than the other state-of-the-art predictors in the related fields. based on these semantics analysis methods, a platform called bioseq-diabolo has been constructed, which is named after a popular traditional sport in china. the users only need to input the embeddings of the biological sequence data. bioseq-diabolo will intelligently identify the task, and then accurately analyse the biological sequence similarities based on biological language semantics. bioseq-diabolo will integrate different biological sequence similarities in a supervised manner by using learning to rank (ltr), and the performance of the constructed methods will be evaluated and analysed so as to recommend the best methods for the users. the web server and stand-alone package of bioseq-diabolo can be accessed at http://bliulab.net/ bioseq-diabolo/server/.",AB_0244
"convolutional neural networks (cnns) have made enormous progress in medical image segmentation. the learning of cnns is dependent on a large amount of training data with fine annotations. the workload of data labeling can be significantly relieved via collecting imperfect annotations which only match the underlying ground truths coarsely. however, label noises which are systematically introduced by the annotation protocols, severely hinders the learning of cnn-based segmentation models. hence, we devise a novel collaborative learning framework in which two segmentation models cooperate to combat label noises in coarse annotations. first, the complementary knowledge of two models is explored by making one model clean training data for the other model. secondly, to further alleviate the negative impact of label noises and make sufficient usage of the training data, the specific reliable knowledge of each model is distilled into the other model with augmentation-based consistency constraints. a reliability-aware sample selection strategy is incorporated for guaranteeing the quality of the distilled knowledge. moreover, we employ joint data and model augmentations to expand the usage of reliable knowledge. extensive experiments on two benchmarks showcase the superiority of our proposed method against existing methods under annotations with different noise levels. for example, our approach can improve existing methods by nearly 3% dsc on the lung lesion segmentation dataset lidc-idri under annotations with 80% noise ratio. code is available at: https://github.com/amber-believe/reliablemutualdistillation.",AB_0244
