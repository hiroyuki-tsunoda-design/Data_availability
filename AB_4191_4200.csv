"background: early delivery in preterm preeclampsia may reduce the risks for the patient, but consequences of prematurity may be substantial for the baby. this trial evaluated whether the implementation of a risk stratification model could safely reduce prematurity.methods: this was a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial in seven clusters. patients presenting with suspected or confirmed preeclampsia between 20+0 and 36+6 gestational weeks were considered eligible. at the start of the trial, all centers were allocated in the preintervention phase, and patients enrolled in this phase were managed according to local treatment guidance. subsequently, every 4 months, 1 randomly allocated cluster transitioned to the intervention. patients enrolled in the intervention phase had sflt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1)/plgf (placental growth factor) ratio and preeclampsia integrated estimate of risk assessments performed. if sflt-1/plgf <= 38 and preeclampsia integrated estimate of risk <10%, patients were considered low risk and clinicians received recommendations to defer delivery. if sflt-1/plgf >38 and preeclampsia integrated estimate of risk >= 10%, patients were considered not low risk, and clinicians received recommendations to increase surveillance. the primary outcome was the proportion of patients with preterm preeclampsia delivered prematurely out of total deliveries.results: between march 25, 2017 and december 24, 2019, 586 and 563 patients were analyzed in the intervention and usual care groups, respectively. the event rate was 1.09% in the intervention group, and 1.37% in the usual care group. after prespecified adjustments for variation between and within clusters over time, the adjusted risk ratio was 1.45 ([95% ci, 1.04-2.02]; p=0.029), indicating a higher risk of preterm deliveries in the intervention group. post hoc analysis including calculation of risk differences did not show evidence of statistical differences. abnormal sflt-1/plgf was associated with a higher rate of identifying preeclampsia with severe features.conclusions: the introduction of an intervention based on biomarkers and clinical factors for risk stratification did not lead to reductions in preterm deliveries. further training on the interpretation of disease severity in preeclampsia and the development of additional risk stratification is needed before adoption into clinical practice.registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct03073317.",AB_0420
"labeling of datasets is an essential task for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning. model-based active learning and user-based interactive labeling are two complementary strategies for this task. we propose visgil which, using visual cues, guides the user in the selection of instances to label based on utility measures deduced from an active learning model. we have implemented the approach and conducted a qualitative and quantitative user study and a think-aloud test. the studies reveal that guidance by visual cues improves the trained model's accuracy, reduces the time needed to label the dataset, and increases users' confidence while selecting instances. furthermore, we gained insights regarding how guidance impacts user behavior and how the individual visual cues contribute to user guidance. a video of the approach is available: https://ml-and-vis.org/visgil/.",AB_0420
"this paper introduces a novel trajectory generation and optimization algorithm (tgo) that enables agile and aggressive flight of quadrotor uavs while considering various constraints associated with robot dynamics, actuator inputs, and flight environment. the tgo algorithm employs time-parametrized polynomial trajectories based on a predetermined sequence of waypoints to produce dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories. this approach extends previous work that utilized differential flatness property and polynomial based trajectories by eliminating the need for iterative searching and computationally intensive sampling. one of the significant advantages of the tgo algorithm is its numerical stability for large number of waypoints and high order polynomials. to address the ill-conditioned problem of quadratic programming (qp) based methods, the tgo algorithm reformulates the trajectory generation and optimization problem into an unconstrained quadratic programming (ucp) using the numerically stable null-space factorization method. the tgo algorithm produces minimum derivative trajectories and minimum waypoints arrival times, generating a wide range of aggressive trajectories that can leverage the full maneuvering capabilities of quadrotor robots. the proposed algorithm's numerical stability and computational advantages are demonstrated through various scenarios and comparisons. an animated simulation of the tgo algorithm is available at: https://youtu.be/mvvhbg14iig.",AB_0420
"background recently we developed a gene orthology inference tool based on genome rearrangements (journal of bioinformatics and computational biology 19:6, 2021). given a set of genomes our method first computes all pairwise gene similarities. then it runs pairwise ilp comparisons to compute optimal gene matchings, which minimize, by taking the similarities into account, the weighted rearrangement distance between the analyzed genomes (a problem that is np-hard). the gene matchings are then integrated into gene families in the final step. the mentioned ilp includes an optimal capping that connects each end of a linear segment of one genome to an end of a linear segment in the other genome, producing an exponential increase of the search space. results in this work, we design and implement a heuristic capping algorithm that replaces the optimal capping by clustering (based on their gene content intersections) the linear segments into m >= 1subsets, whose ends are capped independently. furthermore, in each subset, instead of allowing all possible connections, we let only the ends of content-related segments be connected. although there is no guarantee that m is much bigger than one, and with the possible side effect of resulting in sub-optimal instead of optimal gene matchings, the heuristic works very well in practice, from both the speed performance and the quality of computed solutions. our experiments on primate and fruit fly genomes show two positive results. first, for complete assemblies of five primates the version with heuristic capping reports orthologies that are very similar to the orthologies computed by the version of our tool with optimal capping. second, we were able to efficiently analyze fruit fly genomes with incomplete assemblies distributed in hundreds or even thousands of contigs, obtaining gene families that are very similar to flybase families. indeed, our tool inferred a higher number of complete cliques, with a higher intersection with flybase, when compared to gene families computed by other inference tools. we added a post-processing for refining, with the aid of the mcl algorithm, our ambiguous families (those with more than one gene per genome), improving even more the accuracy of our results. our approach is implemented into a pipeline incorporating the pre-computation of gene similarities and the post-processing refinement of ambiguous families with mcl. both the original version with optimal capping and the new modified version with heuristic capping can be downloaded, together with their detailed documentations, at https://gitlab.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/gi/ffgc or as a conda package at https://anaconda.org/bioco nda/ffgc.",AB_0420
"background techniques for autofluorescence have been introduced to visualize the parathyroid glands during surgery and to reduce hypoparathyroidism after thyroidectomy.methods this parallel multicentre rct investigated the use of fluobeam & reg; lx to visualize the parathyroid glands by autofluorescence during total thyroidectomy compared with no use. there was no restriction on the indication for surgery. patients were randomized 1 : 1 and were blinded to the group allocation. the hypothesis was that autofluorescence enables identification and protection of the parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy. the primary endpoint was the rate of low parathyroid hormone (pth) levels the day after surgery.results some 535 patients were randomized, and 486 patients received an intervention according to the study protocol, 246 in the fluobeam & reg; lx group and 240 in the control group. some 64 patients (26.0 per cent) in the fluobeam & reg; lx group and 77 (32.1 per cent) in the control group had low levels of pth after thyroidectomy (p = 0.141; relative risk (rr) 0.81, 95 per cent c.i. 0.61 to 1.07). subanalysis of 174 patients undergoing central lymph node clearance showed that 15 of 82 (18 per cent) in the fluobeam & reg; lx group and 31 of 92 (33 per cent) in the control group had low levels of pth on postoperative day 1 (p = 0.021; rr 0.54, 0.31 to 0.93). more parathyroid glands were identified during operation in patients who had surgery with fluobeam & reg; lx, and fewer parathyroid glands in the surgical specimen on definitive histopathology. no specific harm related to the use of fluobeam & reg; lx was reported.conclusion the use of autofluorescence during thyroidectomy did not reduce the rate of low pth levels on postoperative day 1 in the whole group of patients. it did, however, reduce the rate in a subgroup of patients. registration number: nct04509011 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). this multicentre rct, performed in four centres and in four countries, has provided evidence for the benefit of using autofluorescence during thyroidectomy to identify and preserve the parathyroid glands.",AB_0420
"pathological brain lesions exhibit diverse appearance in brain images, in terms of intensity, texture, shape, size, and location. comprehensive sets of data and annotations are difficult to acquire. therefore, unsupervised anomaly detection approaches have been proposed using only normal data for training, with the aim of detecting outlier anomalous voxels at test time. denoising methods, for instance classical denoising autoencoders (daes) and more recently emerging diffusion models, are a promising approach, however naive application of pixelwise noise leads to poor anomaly detection performance. we show that optimization of the spatial resolution and magnitude of the noise improves the performance of different model training regimes, with similar noise parameter adjustments giving good performance for both daes and diffusion models. visual inspection of the reconstructions suggests that the training noise influences the trade-off between the extent of the detail that is reconstructed and the extent of erasure of anomalies, both of which contribute to better anomaly detection performance. we validate our findings on two real-world datasets (tumor detection in brain mri and hemorrhage/ischemia/tumor detection in brain ct), showing good detection on diverse anomaly appearances. overall, we find that a dae trained with coarse noise is a fast and simple method that gives state-of-the-art accuracy. diffusion models applied to anomaly detection are as yet in their infancy and provide a promising avenue for further research.code for our dae model and coarse noise is provided at: https://github.com/antanaskascenas/denoisingae.",AB_0420
"we report charadriiform and charadriiform-like birds from the early eocene london clay of walton-on-the-naze (essex, uk). a partial skeleton of a small modern-type charadriiform is described as a new species, charadriisimilis essexensis n. gen. n. sp., and most closely resembles taxa of the charadrii (plovers, stilts, oystercatchers, and other wader-like shorebirds). affinities to this clade were also supported by phylogenetic analyses, which placed the fossil as the sister taxon of either the burhinidae or all crown group charadrii. in addition, we identify specimens of the charadriiform-like taxon scandiavis, which was before known only from the early eocene fur formation in denmark. associated limb elements of two individuals are classified as scandiavis cf. mikkelseni bertelli et al., 2013, and remains of two further individuals are tentatively assigned to scandiavis. the presence of a processus supracondylaris dorsalis on the previously unknown humerus corroborates charadriiform affinities of scandiavis, whereas a plesiomorphic hypotarsus morphology indicates a position outside crown group charadriiformes. charadriisimilis essexensis is one of the earliest modern-type charadriiforms, and the holotype of the species is the most substantial early paleogene fossil record of a charadriiform bird. together with scandiavis, as the best-represented taxon to be considered as a stem group charadriiform, it provides the basis for an improved understanding of the evolutionary history of charadriiform birds.uuid: http://zoobank.org/ca15ee81-09e8-4577-8beb-a362debf6636",AB_0420
"lung adenocarcinoma (luad) is a morphologically heterogeneous disease with five predominant histologic subtypes. fully supervised convolutional neural networks can improve the accuracy and reduce the subjectivity of luad histologic subtyping using hematoxylin and eosin (h&e)-stained whole slide images (wsis). however, developing supervised models with good prediction accuracy usually requires extensive manual data annotation, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. this work proposes three self-supervised learning (ssl) pretext tasks to reduce labeling effort. these tasks not only leverage the multi-resolution nature of the h&e wsis but also explicitly consider the relevance to the downstream task of classifying the luad histologic subtypes. two tasks involve predicting the spatial relationship between tiles cropped from lower and higher magnification wsis. we hypothesize that these tasks induce the model to learn to distinguish different tissue structures presented in the images, thus benefiting the downstream classification. the third task involves predicting the eosin stain from the hematoxylin stain, inducing the model to learn cytoplasmic features relevant to luad subtypes. the effective-ness of the three proposed ssl tasks and their ensemble was demonstrated by comparison with other state-of-the-art pretraining and ssl methods using three publicly available datasets. our work can be extended to any other cancer type where tissue architectural information is important. the model could be used to expedite and complement the process of routine pathology diagnosis tasks. the code is available at https://github.com/rina-ding/ssl_luad_classification.",AB_0420
"backgroundgenome-wide association studies (gwas) have identified hundreds of genetic loci associated with kidney function. by combining these findings with post-gwas information (e.g., statistical fine-mapping to identify independent association signals and to narrow down signals to causal variants; or different sources of annotation data), new hypotheses regarding physiology and disease aetiology can be obtained. these hypotheses need to be tested in laboratory experiments, for example, to identify new therapeutic targets. for this purpose, the evidence obtained from gwas and post-gwas analyses must be processed and presented in a way that they are easily accessible to kidney researchers without specific gwas expertise.mainhere we present kidneygps, a user-friendly web-application that combines genetic variant association for estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) from the chronic kidney disease genetics consortium with annotation of (i) genetic variants with functional or regulatory effects (snp-to-gene mapping), (ii) genes with kidney phenotypes in mice or human (gene-to-phenotype), and (iii) drugability of genes (to support re-purposing). kidneygps adopts a comprehensive approach summarizing evidence for all 5906 genes in the 424 gwas loci for egfr identified previously and the 35,885 variants in the 99% credible sets of 594 independent signals. kidneygps enables user-friendly access to the abundance of information by search functions for genes, variants, and regions. kidneygps also provides a function (gps tab) to generate lists of genes with specific characteristics thus enabling customizable gene prioritisation (gps). these specific characteristics can be as broad as any gene in the 424 loci with a known kidney phenotype in mice or human; or they can be highly focussed on genes mapping to genetic variants or signals with particularly with high statistical support. kidneygps is implemented with rshiny in a modularized fashion to facilitate update of input data (https://kidneygps.ur.de/gps/).conclusionwith the focus on kidney function related evidence, kidneygps fills a gap between large general platforms for accessing gwas and post-gwas results and the specific needs of the kidney research community. this makes kidneygps an important platform for kidney researchers to help translate in silico research results into in vitro or in vivo research.",AB_0420
