"federated learning is an emerging paradigm allowing large-scale decentralized learning without sharing data across different data owners, which helps address the concern of data privacy in medical image analysis. however, the requirement for label consistency across clients by the existing methods largely narrows its application scope. in practice, each clinical site may only annotate certain organs of interest with partial or no overlap with other sites. incorporating such partially labeled data into a unified federation is an unexplored problem with clinical significance and urgency. this work tackles the challenge by using a novel federated multi-encoding u-net (fed-menu) method for multi-organ segmentation. in our method, a multi-encoding u-net (menu-net) is proposed to extract organ-specific features through different encoding sub-networks. each sub-network can be seen as an expert of a specific organ and trained for that client. moreover, to encourage the organ-specific features extracted by different sub-networks to be informative and distinctive, we regularize the training of the menu-net by designing an auxiliary generic decoder (agd). extensive experiments on six public abdominal ct datasets show that our fed-menu method can effectively obtain a federated learning model using the partially labeled datasets with superior performance to other models trained by either localized or centralized learning methods. source code is publicly available at https://github.com/dial-rpi/fed-menu.",AB_0573
"background adult hematopoietic cell transplant (hct) recipients are at high risk for influenza-related morbidity and mortality and have suboptimal influenza vaccine immune responses compared to healthy adults, particularly within 2 years of transplant.methods this phase ii, double-blind, multicenter randomized controlled trial compared 2 doses of high-dose trivalent (hd-tiv) to 2 doses of standard-dose quadrivalent (sd-qiv) influenza vaccine administered 1 month apart in adults 3-23 months post-allogeneic hct. hemagglutinin antibody inhibition (hai) titers were measured at baseline, 4 weeks following each vaccine dose, and approximately 7 months post-second vaccination. injection-site and systemic reactions were assessed for 7 days post-vaccination. the primary immunogenicity comparison was geometric mean hai titer (gmt) at visit 3 (4 weeks after the second dose); we used linear mixed models to estimate adjusted gmt ratios (agmrs) comparing hd-tiv/sd-qiv for each antigen.results we randomized 124 adults; 64 received sd-qiv and 60 received hd-tiv. following the second vaccination, hd-tiv was associated with higher gmts compared to sd-qiv for a/h3n2 (agmr = 2.09; 95% confidence interval [ci]: [1.19, 3.68]) and b/victoria (agmr = 1.61; 95% ci: [1.00, 2.58]). the increase was not statistically significant for a/h1n1 (agmr = 1.16; 95% ci: [0.67, 2.02]). there was a trend to more injection-site reactions for hd-tiv after the second vaccination compared to sd-qiv (50% vs 33%; adjusted odds ratio [aor] = 4.53; 95% ci: [0.71, 28.9]), whereas systemic reactions were similar between groups with both injections.conclusions adult allogeneic hct recipients who received 2 doses of hd-tiv produced higher hai antibody responses for a/h3n2 and b/victoria compared with 2 doses of sd-qiv, with comparable injection-site or systemic reactions. in this phase ii, double-blind, multicenter randomized controlled trial of post-allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, 2 doses of high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine had superior immunogenicity than 2 doses of standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine. graphical abstract this graphical abstract is also available at tidbit: https://tidbitapp.io/tidbits/comparison-of-two-high-dose-versus-two-standard-dose-influenza-vaccines-in-adult-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients-17b01d1d-6b7c-486f-9645-5d38dbbfeabd",AB_0573
"we present keymorph, a deep learning-based image registration framework that relies on automatically detecting corresponding keypoints. state-of-the-art deep learning methods for registration often are not robust to large misalignments, are not interpretable, and do not incorporate the symmetries of the problem. in addition, most models produce only a single prediction at test-time. our core insight which addresses these shortcomings is that corresponding keypoints between images can be used to obtain the optimal transformation via a differentiable closed-form expression. we use this observation to drive the end-to-end learning of keypoints tailored for the registration task, and without knowledge of ground-truth keypoints. this framework not only leads to substantially more robust registration but also yields better interpretability, since the keypoints reveal which parts of the image are driving the final alignment. moreover, keymorph can be designed to be equivariant under image translations and/or symmetric with respect to the input image ordering. finally, we show how multiple deformation fields can be computed efficiently and in closed-form at test time corresponding to different transformation variants. we demonstrate the proposed framework in solving 3d affine and spline-based registration of multi-modal brain mri scans. in particular, we show registration accuracy that surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, especially in the context of large displacements. our code is available at https://github.com/alanqrwang/keymorph.",AB_0573
"multi-task learning (mtl) methods have been extensively employed for joint localization and classification of breast lesions on ultrasound images to assist in cancer diagnosis and personalized treatment. one typical paradigm in mtl is a shared trunk network architecture. however, such a model design may suffer information-sharing conflicts and only achieve suboptimal performance for individual tasks. additionally, the model relies on fully-supervised learning methodologies, imposing heavy burdens on data annotation. in this study, we propose a novel joint localization and classification model based on attention mechanisms and a sequential semi-supervised learning strategy to address these challenges. our proposed framework offers three primary advantages. first, a lesion-aware network with multiple attention modules is designed to improve model performance on lesion localization. an attention-based classifier explicitly establishes correlations between the two tasks, alleviating information-sharing conflicts while leveraging location information to assist in classification. second, a two-stage sequential semi-supervised learning strategy is designed for model training to achieve optimal performance on both tasks and substantially reduces the need for data annotation. third, the asymmetric and modular model architecture allows for the flexible interchangeability of individual components, rendering the model adaptable to various applications. experimental results from two different breast ultrasound image datasets under varied conditions have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. furthermore, we conduct comprehensive investigations into the impacts of various factors on model performance, gaining in-depth insights into the mechanism of our proposed framework. the code is available at https://github.com/comp-imaging-sci/lanet-bus.git.",AB_0573
"self-supervised neural language models have recently found wide applications in the generative design of organic molecules and protein sequences as well as representation learning for downstream structure classification and functional prediction. however, most of the existing deep learning models for molecule design usually require a big dataset and have a black-box architecture, which makes it difficult to interpret their design logic. here we propose the generative molecular transformer (gmtransformer), a probabilistic neural network model for generative design of molecules. our model is built on the blank filling language model originally developed for text processing, which has demonstrated unique advantages in learning the molecules grammars with high-quality generation, interpretability, and data efficiency. benchmarked on the moses datasets, our models achieve high novelty and scaf compared to other baselines. the probabilistic generation steps have the potential in tinkering with molecule design due to their capability of recommending how to modify existing molecules with explanation, guided by the learned implicit molecule chemistry. the source code and datasets can be accessed freely at https://github.com/usccolumbia/gmtransformer",AB_0573
"we propose dual cross-attention (dca), a simple yet effective attention module that enhances skip-connections in u-net-based architectures for medical image segmentation. the plain and simple skip-connection scheme in u-net-based architectures struggles with capturing the multi-scale context, resulting in a semantic gap between encoder and decoder features. such a semantic gap causes redundancy between low and high-level features which ultimately limits the segmentation performance. in this paper, we address this issue by sequentially capturing channel and spatial dependencies across multi-scale encoder features that adaptively combine low and high-level features in various scales to effectively bridge the semantic gap. first, the channel cross-attention (cca) extracts global channel-wise dependencies by utilizing cross-attention across channel tokens of multi-scale encoder features. then, the spatial cross-attention (sca) module performs cross -attention to capture spatial dependencies across spatial tokens. finally, these fine-grained encoder features are up-sampled and connected to their corresponding decoder parts to form the skip-connection scheme. our proposed dca module can be integrated into any encoder-decoder architecture with skip-connections such as u-net and its variants as well as advanced architectures based on vision transformers. the experimental results using six medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that our dca module can consistently improve the overall segmentation performance at a slight parameter increase. our codes are available at: https://github.com/gorkemcanates/dual-cross-attention.",AB_0573

"transformer-based models, capable of learning better global dependencies, have recently demonstrated exceptional representation learning capabilities in computer vision and medical image analysis. transformer reformats the image into separate patches and realizes global communication via the self-attention mechanism. however, positional information between patches is hard to preserve in such 1d sequences, and loss of it can lead to sub-optimal performance when dealing with large amounts of heterogeneous tissues of various sizes in 3d medical image segmentation. additionally, current methods are not robust and efficient for heavy-duty medical segmentation tasks such as predicting a large number of tissue classes or modeling globally inter-connected tissue structures. to address such challenges and inspired by the nested hierarchical structures in vision transformer, we proposed a novel 3d medical image segmentation method (unest), employing a simplified and faster-converging transformer encoder design that achieves local communication among spatially adjacent patch sequences by aggregating them hierarchically. we extensively validate our method on multiple challenging datasets, consisting of multiple modalities, anatomies, and a wide range of tissue classes, including 133 structures in the brain, 14 organs in the abdomen, 4 hierarchical components in the kidneys, inter-connected kidney tumors and brain tumors. we show that unest consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and evaluate its generalizability and data efficiency. particularly, the model achieves whole brain segmentation task complete roi with 133 tissue classes in a single network, outperforming prior state-of-the-art method slant27 ensembled with 27 networks. our model performance increases the mean dsc score of the publicly available colin and candi dataset from 0.7264 to 0.7444 and from 0.6968 to 0.7025, respectively. code, pre-trained models, and use case pipeline are available at: https://github.com/masilab/unest.",AB_0573
"antibiotic resistance is of crucial interest to both human and animal medicine. it has been recognized that increased environmental monitoring of antibiotic resistance is needed. metagenomic dna sequencing is becoming an attractive method to profile antibiotic resistance genes (args), including a special focus on pathogens. a number of computational pipelines are available and under development to support environmental arg monitoring; the pipeline we present here is promising for general adoption for the purpose of harmonized global monitoring. specifically, argem is a user-friendly pipeline that provides full-service analysis, from the initial dna short reads to the final visualization of results. the capture of extensive metadata is also facilitated to support comparability across projects and broader monitoring goals. the argem pipeline offers efficient analysis of a modest number of samples along with affordable computational components, though the throughput could be increased through cloud resources, based on the user's configuration. the pipeline components were carefully assessed and selected to satisfy tradeoffs, balancing efficiency and flexibility. it was essential to provide a step to perform short read assembly in a reasonable time frame to ensure accurate annotation of identified args. comprehensive arg and mobile genetic element databases are included in argem for annotation support. argem further includes an expandable set of analysis tools that include statistical and network analysis and supports various useful visualization techniques, including cytoscape visualization of co-occurrence and correlation networks. the performance and flexibility of the argem pipeline is demonstrated with analysis of aquatic metagenomes. the pipeline is freely available at https://github.com/xlxlxlx/argem.",AB_0573
"background:dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) can lead to advanced disease, defined herein as necessitating a durable left ventricular assist device or a heart transplant (lvad/ht). dcm is known to have a genetic basis, but the association of rare variant genetics with advanced dcm has not been studied.methods:we analyzed clinical and genetic sequence data from patients enrolled between 2016 and 2021 in the us multisite dcm precision medicine study, which was a geographically diverse, multiracial, multiethnic cohort. clinical evaluation included standardized patient interview and medical record query forms. dcm severity was classified into 3 groups: patients with advanced disease with lvad/ht; patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (icd) only; or patients with no icd or lvad/ht. rare variants in 36 dcm genes were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic or variants of uncertain significance. confounding factors we considered included demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, access to care, dcm duration, and comorbidities. crude and adjusted associations between dcm severity and rare variant genetic findings were assessed using multinomial models with generalized logit link.results:patients' mean (sd) age was 51.9 (13.6) years; 42% were of african ancestry, 56% were of european ancestry, and 44% were female. of 1198 patients, 347 had lvad/ht, 511 had an icd, and 340 had no lvad/ht or icd. the percentage of patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants was 26.2%, 15.9%, and 15.0% for those with lvad/ht, icd only, or neither, respectively. after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities, patients with dcm with lvad/ht were more likely than those without lvad/ht or icd to have dcm-related pathogenic or likely pathogenic rare variants (odds ratio, 2.3 [95% ci, 1.5-3.6]). the association did not differ by ancestry. rare variant genetic findings were similar between patients with dcm with an icd and those without lvad/ht or icd.conclusions:advanced dcm was associated with higher odds of rare variants in dcm genes adjudicated as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, compared with individuals with less severe dcm. this finding may help assess the risk of outcomes in management of patients with dcm and their at-risk family members.registration:url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct03037632.",AB_0573
