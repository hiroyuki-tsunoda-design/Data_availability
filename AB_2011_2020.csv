"in recent years, salient object detection (sod) has made great progress in natural scene images (nsis), but sod of strip steel defect images (sdis) in industrial scenes is still an open and challenging problem. existing detection methods are difficult to segment different types of defects with clutter and shallow contrast. therefore, we propose a novel autocorrelation-aware aggregation network (a3net) for sod of strip steel surface defects. first, we use a general residual attention mechanism to enhance the encoder features and accelerate the convergence of the model. in the decoder stage, we propose a global autocorrelation module (gam) to explore semantic information cues of high-level features to locate and guide low-level information. then, we deploy the scale interaction module (sim) to realize the fusion and interaction of feature information between different layers. finally, we design a local autocorrelation module (lam) to further refine the edge details of salient objects. we conduct detailed and rich experiments on the public strip steel surface defects dataset, which proves that our method is consistently superior to the state-of-the-art methods. in addition, we build a new challenging strip sdi dataset with multiple defect types for the sod task, which contains 4800 images with pixel-level annotations. our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/vdt-2048/a3net.",AB_0202
"real-time semantic segmentation of lidar measurements is crucial for high-level perception in unmanned systems, such as unmanned ground vehicles (ugvs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs). the limited computation and memory capacity of onboard devices, however, restricts most existing methods to offline analyses. to solve this problem, this article proposes an attention-based 3-d semantic segmentation approach, 3d-arss, which is able to classify measurements from a velodyne hdl-64e sensor at the speed of 5 fps on agx xavier. in our approach, we present two plug-and-play attention modules, a spatial attention module and a channel attention module. the former is to learn local-global context by reweighting features from different regions; the latter is to model the importance of different-scale features for semantic information fusion. to effectively process large-scale point clouds, a sparse-tensor (st)-based implementation is introduced. two kinds of sparse convolution operations are used to reduce unnecessary computation and memory costs on free spaces. experimental results on the semantickitti and nuscenes datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art real-time methods by +3.1% and +2.2% mean intersection over union (miou), respectively. the floating-point operations of our method are reduced to 2/5 of spvnas and 1/4 of rpvnet. our source code is available at https://github.com/wuzhaoo/3d-arss.",AB_0202
"no-service rail surface defect (nrsd) segmentation is an essential way for perceiving the quality of no-service rails. however, due to the complex and diverse outlines and low-contrast textures of no-service rails, existing natural image segmentation methods cannot achieve promising performance in nrsd images, especially in some unique and challenging nrsd scenes, such as low illumination, chaotic background, multiple/tiny defects, and inconsistent defects. to this end, in this article, we propose a novel segmentation network for nrsds based on normalized attention and dual-scale interaction, named nadinet. specifically, nadinet follows the enhancement-interaction paradigm. the normalized channel-wise self-attention module (nam) and the dual-scale interaction block (dib) are two key components of nadinet. nam is a specific extension of the channel-wise self-attention mechanism (cam) to enhance features extracted from low-contrast nrsd images. the softmax layer in cam will produce very small correlation coefficients which are not conducive to low-contrast feature enhancement. instead, in nam, we directly calculate the normalized correlation coefficient between channels to enlarge the feature differentiation. dib is specifically designed for the feature interaction of the enhanced features. it has two interaction branches with dual scales, one for fine-grained clues and the other for coarse-grained clues. with both branches working together, dib can perceive defect regions of different granularities. with these modules working together, our nadinet can generate an accurate segmentation map. extensive experiments on the public nrsd-mn dataset with man-made and natural nrsds demonstrate that our proposed nadinet with various backbones (i.e., vgg, resnet, and densenet) consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods. the code and results of our method are available at https://github.com/monxxcn/nadinet.",AB_0202
"the ability to track multiple objects is crucial for roadside units to provide high-precision, trajectory-based traffic data, especially for connected vehicles that require complementary and long-range traffic information to improve road safety. occlusion and continuous tracking are major challenges that have hindered the achievement of obtaining accurate, uninterrupted, and consistent multiobject tracking using roadside light detection and range (lidar) technology. this article presents a lane-level and full-cycle multivehicle tracking (mvt) method that uses low-channel roadside lidar (lrlt). first, a lane-level map was created by analyzing multiple frames of traffic object detection results. then, we introduced an association method based on a search process and a microscopic motion model, while considering the lane-level map as a constraint. the search process aims to identify all the previous tracks that might be linked to the target vehicle, while the microscopic motion model ensures finding a correct historical track for association. in addition, a detection optimization approach using the lane-level map was also proposed to enhance the tracking performance. finally, we created a new roadside tracking dataset for experimental studies using velodyne vlp-16 lidar sensors. the results showed that our algorithm achieved the highest accuracy and the strongest anti-occlusion performance compared with other popular algorithms such as simple online and realtime tracking (sort), observation-centric sort (oc-sort), and bytetrack. it is therefore a very suitable method for obtaining complete vehicle tracks using roadside lidar technology. the dataset and source code are available at https://github.com/moxigua/lmat.",AB_0202
"in the existing deep learning-based watermarking models, extracted image features for fusing with watermark are not abundant enough and more critically, and essential features are not highlighted to be learned with the purpose of robust watermarking, both of which limit the watermarking performance. to solve those two drawbacks, this article proposes an attention-guided robust image watermarking model based on a generative adversarial network (arwgan). to acquire a great deal of representational image features, a feature fusion module (ffm) is devised to learn shallow and deep features effectively for multilayer fusion with watermark, and meanwhile, reuse of those features by the dense connection enhances robustness. to alleviate image distortion caused by embedding watermark, an attention module (am) is deployed to compute the attention mask by mining the global features of the original image. specifically, with the guidance of the attention mask, image features representing inconspicuous regions and texture regions are enhanced for embedding the high strength of watermark, and simultaneously, other features are suppressed to improve the watermarking performance. furthermore, the noise subnetwork is adopted for robustness enhancement by simulating various image attacks in iterative training. the discriminator is used to distinguish the encoded image from the original image for improving watermarking invisibility continuously. experimental results demonstrate that the arwgan is superior to the existing state-of-the-art (sota) watermarking models, and ablation experiments prove the effectiveness of the ffm and the am. the code is available at https://github.com/river-huang/arwgan.",AB_0202
"binary feature descriptors have been widely used in various visual measurement tasks, particularly those with limited computing resources and storage capacities. existing binary descriptors may not perform well for long-term visual measurement tasks due to their sensitivity to illumination variations. it can be observed that when image illumination changes dramatically, the relative relationship among local patches mostly remains intact. based on the observation, consequently, this study presents an illumination-insensitive binary (iib) descriptor by leveraging the local inter-patch invariance exhibited in multiple spatial granularities to deal with unfavorable illumination variations. by taking advantage of integral images for local patch feature computation, a highly efficient iib descriptor is achieved. it can encode scalable features in multiple spatial granularities, thus facilitating a computationally efficient hierarchical matching from coarse to fine. moreover, the iib descriptor can also apply to other types of image data, such as depth maps and semantic segmentation results, when available in some applications. numerical experiments on both natural and synthetic datasets reveal that the proposed iib descriptor outperforms the state-of-the-art (sota) binary descriptors and some testing float descriptors. the proposed iib descriptor has also been successfully employed in a demo system for long-term visual localization. the code of the iib descriptor will be publicly available at https://github.com/roylin1229/iib_descriptor.",AB_0202
"in the real mobile screen production line, the yield of normal products is relatively high, so some defects are difficult to collect. besides, samples of emerging defects are difficult to collect in large numbers in a short time. to address the few-shot problem caused by these, we propose a few-shot classification method to simultaneously recognize both the known defects with adequate training data and novel defects with scarce labeled training samples. first, we design a feature extractor with the class-agnostic mask. this module applies normal images to weaken irrelevant background information, thus extracting defect-highlighted features. then, to avoid drowning limited important features in noise, the class prototype generator (cpg) is introduced to produce more representative class prototypes. finally, a context-based classifier (cbc), which applies global context information, is proposed. this module can make better classification decisions among all classes. experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other few-shot methods on the mobile screen defect dataset. the proposed method achieves 89.19% accuracy, 96.96% accuracy, and 97.55% accuracy in the one-shot, five-shot, and ten-shot test scenarios, respectively. the code is available at https://github.com/cfz1/fsl_cls_screen.",AB_0202
"as a core procedure in an increasingly automated industrial environment, defect detection is important for producing microarmatures. however, there are still some difficulties in using general deep learning detection methods, the spatial feature loss problem for small targets of solder surface defects and the difficulty in tuning the reference of sample selection strategy. therefore, this article proposes an adaptive label assignment detection framework. the detector uses an anchor free object detection network as the backbone. a feature compensation method is proposed to complement the spatial information for solving the feature disappearance problem of small objects. for addressing the label matching tuning problem of anchor-free network, an adaptive central region sample selection strategy is proposed at the base of the feature selective anchor-free (fsaf) module. to further improve the performance of the detection head, the dynamic head and soft nonmaximum suppression (soft-nms) are introduced. the detection framework in this article is evaluated on the microarmature solder surface defect detection (mass-det) dataset, and the experimental results show that our framework can achieve 87.7% map50 and 65.5% mar, making it superior to common object detection methods. moreover, the method presented in this article can be applied in most industrial environments to improve the accuracy and efficiency of defect detection of nonstandard microworkpiece. the dataset of this article is open source and available on https://github.com/scuzw/micro-armature-solder-surface-defect-detection.",AB_0202
"automatic defect detection is a critical stage of quality control in the textile industry. because defects vary in texture structure, size, and spatial distribution, existing defect detection methods have difficulty in achieving a perfect tradeoff between detection efficiency, accuracy, and generalizability. this article presents an advanced fabric defect detection model based on a deep learning algorithm. a novel parallel dilated attention module (pdam) was designed: this is nested in the deep layers of the neural network backbone to establish global channel dependencies and capture multiscale contextual information. furthermore, a hook-shaped feature pyramid network (hookfpn) was developed for multiscale context aggregation: this directs the network to focus on lower level features and is helpful for further improving detection efficiency without sacrificing detection accuracy. in addition, the alpha-giou loss is used to improve the accuracy of bounding box regression because of its modulated power parameter $\alpha $ . the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed method were statistically analyzed using data from several public datasets. the code is available at https://github.com/aabb605/hooknet.",AB_0202
"the infrared (ir) horizon is an essential reference for near-ground state awareness and target detection. the traditional horizon detection algorithms based on hand-crafted features claim the advantage of being intuitive and highly targeted, however, their capability of detail extraction and robustness is not strong enough when switching among diverse scenes, meanwhile, the convolutional neural networks (cnns) have the powerful ability in feature acquisition, but has the disadvantages of interpretability and instability. given this, this article proposes a novel horizon detection algorithm that combines the traditional method and cnn. first, the hyper-laplace filter (hlf) is proposed to eliminate the interferences and enhance the saliency of the target. then a positioning module (pm) based on the traditional idea which fully utilizes the structural characteristics of multifeature-maps in cnn is present to extract the endpoints of the horizon. finally, an auxiliary module that consists of a revise branch (rb) and self-attention module (sam) is designed to assist the pm with detailed corrections. compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, experiments based on three datasets with more than 25000 frames under various scenes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves the best accuracy and highest stability but also addresses real-time needs. notably, the detection deviation is controlled within 2 pixels on all three datasets while achieving a comparable detection speed of 170 frames/s. besides, our algorithm also shows strong robustness even under harsh sea conditions and urban backgrounds. code and trained models are available at https://github.com/fjsrepo/infml-hdd.",AB_0202
