"percutaneous nephrolithotomy (labate et al.) is the standard procedure for the treatment of large (>= 2 cm) kidney stones. the patient can be in prone or modified supine posi-tion. the puncture is performed under fluoroscopy and/or ultrasound guidance. the stone-free rate seems to be comparable between miniaturized and standard pcnl. procedures performed with smaller diameter instruments tend to be associated with significant lower blood loss, but longer procedure times. the limitation of the number of percutaneous tracts results in better preservation of the kidney function and lowers the risk of complications. the use of tranexamic acid during pcnl may be interesting for reducing the bleeding risk, the transfusion rate, and possibly the intervention duration. methodology. - these recommendations were developed using two methods: the clinical practice recommendation (cpr) method and the adapte method, depending on whether the question was considered in the european association of urology (eau) recommendations (https://uroweb.org/guidelines/urolithiasis [eau 2022]) and their adaptability to the french context.(c) 2023 elsevier masson sas. all rights reserved.",AB_0456
"postural therapy is a postural procedure to fight against the gravity phenomenon responsible for the non-elimination of lower calyceal stones. it allows improving or accelerating their expulsion and it increases the stone-free rate. this procedure associates forced diuresis, postural inversion, and lumbar percussion. it allows a 50% improvement and an acceleration of fragment elimination. despite its positive impact, postural therapy remains under-used. these are the first practical recommendations on postural therapy. methodology. - these recommendations were developed using two methods: the clinical practice recommendation (cpr) method and the adapte method, depending on whether the question was considered in the european association of urology (eau) recommendations (https://uroweb.org/guidelines/urolithiasis) [eau guidelines on urolithiasis. 2022] and whether they were adaptable to the french context.(c) 2023 elsevier masson sas. all rights reserved.",AB_0456
"the acute situation, caused by an obstructive stone, is defined by a renal colic that may be uncomplicated, complicated, or at risk in specific conditions. its management may be medical or require interventional treatment by extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, endoscopic removal, or ureteroscopy. methodology. - these recommendations were developed using two methods, the clinical practice recommendations (cpr) and the adapte method, in function of whether the question was considered in the european association of urology (eau) recommendations (https://uroweb.org/guidelines/urolithiasis) [eau guidelines on urolithiasis. 2022] and whether they could be adapted to the french context.

"chronic kidney disease, diabetes and hypertension are risk factors of kidney function impairment. the relative risk of kidney failure is 1.52 in patients with urinary stone disease. the various techniques used to remove upper urinary tract stones generally do not alter kidney function in patients with normal kidney function and may sometimes improve kidney function or slow its deterioration in patients with kidney disease. compared to the asynchronous treatment of bilateral renal and ureteral stones, concomitant treatment is associated with higher risk of anuria and the need of additional interventions, in the absence of postoperative stenting. for the treatment of solitary kidney stones, the absence of postoperative stenting increases the risk of postoperative anuria. moreover, the multiplication of percutaneous nephrolithotomy access tracts increases the risk of bleeding and that of kidney function impairment. methodology. - these recommendations were developed according to two methods: the clinical practice recommendations (cpr) method and the adapte method, depending on whether the question was considered in the european association of urology (eau) recommendations (https://uroweb.org/guidelines/urolithiasis) [eau guidelines on urolithiasis. 2022] and their adaptability to the french context.(c) 2023 elsevier masson sas. all rights reserved.",AB_0456
"extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) is a minimally invasive technique for the fragmentation of urinary tract stones using shock waves under fluoroscopic and/or ultrasound guidance. eswl results depend on the indication (stone size/composition, clinical context) and also on how it is performed. the stone structure, nature and density (hounsfield units; evaluated by ct without contrast agent) influence the fragmentation achieved by eswl. the upper size limit of kidney stones has been lowered to 15 mm (1.68 cm(3)) due to the increased risk of steinstrasse with larger sizes and the potential need of anesthesia and ureteral stenting. conversely, the development of endourological technologies allows a finer stone fragmentation and/or better elimination, thus reducing the risk of steinstrasse and decreasing the potential number of sessions or additional interventions.methodology. - these recommendations were developed using two methods: the clinical practice recommendations method (cpr) and the adapte method, depending on whether the question was considered in the european association of urology (eau) recommendations (https://uroweb.org/guidelines/urolithiasis [eau 2022]) and their adaptability to the french context.(c) 2023 elsevier masson sas. all rights reserved.",AB_0456
"it has been shown that the relative risk of cancer is higher in patients with urinary stone disease, probably due to the repeated radiological exams and procedures under fluoroscopic guidance. reducing the radiation doses delivered to the patient also decreases the doses delivered to the operators and their assistants. the doses delivered during endoscopic procedures decrease with the urologist's experience. training in radiation protection and the use of protocols can decrease the use of ionizing radiation in the operating room. methodology. - these recommendations were developed using two methods: the clinical practice recommendation (cpr) method and the adapte method, depending on whether the question was considered in the european association of urology (eau) recommendations (https://uroweb.org/guidelines/urolithiasis) [eau guidelines on urolithiasis. 2022] and whether they were adaptable to the french context.(c) 2023 elsevier masson sas. all rights reserved.",AB_0456
"the spontaneous elimination rate of ureteral stones decreases with their size, but also in function of their location. the objectives of stone surveillance are to detect the occurrence of a complication (e.g., fever, clinical tolerance) and to verify the potential stone migration/elimination. the use of urological procedures and the choice of technique are based on many different factors. kidney stone surveillance is proposed mainly to people with low risk of progression or complications (size < 4 mm and/or lower calyx location and non-infection stone). surveillance may be extended to patients with larger stones, in function of the clinical context and comorbidities. conversely, a urological procedure may also be proposed to patients with stones < 4 mm for professional (e.g., soldier, pilot, expatriate) or social reasons or if travelling is planned. the choice of technique is based on the stone composition (if already known) and density, the advantages and limitations of each technique, and also the clinical context, while trying to choose the least invasive procedure for a stone-free objective. methodology. - these recommendations were developed using two methods: the clinical practice recommendations method (cpr) and the adapte method, depending on whether the question was considered in the european association of urology (eau) recommendations (https://uroweb.org/guidelines/urolithiasis) [eau 2022] and their adaptability to the french context. this chapter is based on the references used in the chapters on the different techniques (extracorporeal shock wave therapy, ureteroscopy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy, medical expulsive therapy, postural therapy, chemolysis by alkalinization) as well as the american urological association (aua) and eau recommendations.

"endocorporeal lithotripsy has progressed thanks to the development of lasers. two laser sources are currently available: holmium:yag (ho:yag) and more recently thulium fiber laser (tfl). the settings generally used are dusting, fragmentation, and pop-corning. these are the first recommendations on laser use for stone management and their settings. settings must be modulated and can be changed during the treatment according to the expected and obtained effects, the location and stone type that is treated. methodology. - these recommendations have been developed using two methods: the clinical practice recommendation (cpr) method and the adapte method, depending on whether or not the question was considered in the european association of urology (eau) recommendations (https://uroweb.org/guidelines/urolithiasis [eau guidelines on urolithiasis. 2022]) and their adaptability to the french context.(c) 2023 elsevier masson sas. all rights reserved.",AB_0456
"the unilectin portal (https://unilectin.unige.ch/) was designed in 2019 with the goal of centralising curated and predicted data on carbohydrate-binding proteins known as lectins. unilectin is also intended as a support for the study of lectomes (full lectin set) of organisms or tissues. the present update describes the inclusion of several new modules and details the latest (https://unilectin.unige.ch/humanlectome/), covering our knowledge of the human lectome and comprising 215 unevenly characterised lectins, particularly in terms of structural information. each humanlectome entry is protein-centric and compiles evidence of carbohydrate recognition domain(s), specificity, 3d-structure, tissue-based expression and related genomic data. other recent improvements regarding interoperability and accessibility are outlined. graphical abstract",AB_0456
"motivation there is a growing number of available protein sequences, but only a limited amount has been manually annotated. for example, only 0.25% of all entries of uniprotkb are reviewed by human annotators. further developing automatic tools to infer protein function from sequence alone can alleviate part of this gap. in this article, we investigate the potential of transformer deep neural networks on a specific case of functional sequence annotation: the prediction of enzymatic classes.results we show that our enzbert transformer models, trained to predict enzyme commission (ec) numbers by specialization of a protein language model, outperforms state-of-the-art tools for monofunctional enzyme class prediction based on sequences only. accuracy is improved from 84% to 95% on the prediction of ec numbers at level two on the ec40 benchmark. to evaluate the prediction quality at level four, the most detailed level of ec numbers, we built two new time-based benchmarks for comparison with state-of-the-art methods ecpred and deepec: the macro-f1 score is respectively improved from 41% to 54% and from 20% to 26%. finally, we also show that using a simple combination of attention maps is on par with, or better than, other classical interpretability methods on the ec prediction task. more specifically, important residues identified by attention maps tend to correspond to known catalytic sites. quantitatively, we report a max f-gain score of 96.05%, while classical interpretability methods reach 91.44% at best.availability and implementation source code and datasets are respectively available at https://gitlab.inria.fr/nbuton/tfpc and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7253910",AB_0456
