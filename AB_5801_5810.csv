"design studies are an integral method of visualization research with hundreds of instances in the literature. although taught as a theory, the practical implementation of design studies is often excluded from visualization pedagogy due to the lengthy time commitments associated with such studies. recent research has addressed this challenge and developed an expedited design study framework, the design study lite methodology (dslm), which can implement design studies with novice students within just 14 weeks. the framework was developed and evaluated based on five semesters of in-person data visualization courses with 30 students or less and was implemented in conjunction with service-learning (s-l). with the growth and popularity of the data visualization field-and the teaching environment created by the covid-19 pandemic-more academic institutions are offering visualization courses online. therefore, in this paper, we strengthen and validate the epistemological foundations of the dslm framework by testing its (1) adaptability to online learning environments and conditions and (2) scalability to larger classes with up to 57 students. we present two online implementations of the dslm framework, with and without service-learning (s-l), to test the adaptability and scalability of the framework. we further demonstrate that the framework can be applied effectively without the s-l component. we reflect on our experience with the online dslm implementations and contribute a detailed retrospective analysis using thematic analysis and grounded theory methods to draw valuable recommendations and guidelines for future applications of the framework. this work verifies that dslm can be used successfully in online classes to teach design study methodology. finally, we contribute novel additions to the dslm framework to further enhance it for teaching and learning design studies in the classroom. the preprint and supplementary materials for this paper can be found at https://osf.io/6bjx5/.",AB_0581
"research highlight: van scoyoc, a., smith, j. a., gaynor, k. m., barker, k., & brashares, j. s. (2023) the influence of human activity on predator-prey spatiotemporal overlap. journal of animal ecology, https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13892. few corners of the globe remain untouched by humans, and thus nearly all wildlife communities are influenced by human activity. van scoyoc et al. (2023) present a framework that places predator-prey interactions explicitly within an anthropogenic context, revealing that predator-prey dyads fall into one of four categories depending on whether predators and prey are attracted to or avoid human activity. these responses can either increase or decrease overlap among species via divergent pathways, which can help to make sense of seemingly conflicting patterns from prior studies. their framework facilitates hypothesis testing, which they demonstrate with a meta-analysis of 178 predator-prey dyads from 19 camera trap studies. with evidence for each of the four pathways, yet some unexpected outcomes for temporal overlap among dyads, this review generates exciting questions and lays out a productive path forward to improve our understanding of species interactions in the anthropocene.",AB_0581
"research highlight: davis, c. l., walls, s. c., barichivich, w. j., brown, m. e., & miller, d. a. (2022). disentangling direct and indirect effects of extreme events on coastal wetland communities. journal of animal ecology, https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13874. catastrophic events such as floods, hurricanes, winter storms, droughts and wildfires increasingly touch our lives either directly or indirectly. these events draw our attention to the seriousness of changes in climate not only to human well-being but also to the integrity of ecological systems upon which we depend. understanding the impacts of extreme events on ecological systems requires the ability to characterize the cascading effects of environmental changes on the environments in which organisms live and the altered biological interactions produced. this scientific ambition represents no small challenge for the study of animal communities, which are typically difficult to census as well as dynamic in time and space. davis et al. (2022) in a recent study in the journal of animal ecology examined the amphibian and fish communities found in depressional coastal wetlands to better understand how they respond to major rainfall and flooding events. data from the u.s. geological survey's amphibian research and monitoring initiative provided an 8-year record of observations as well as environmental measurements. for this study, the authors integrated techniques for assessing the dynamics of animal populations with a bayesian implementation of structural equation modelling. using their integrated methodological approach permitted the authors to reveal the direct and indirect effects of extreme weather events on co-occurring amphibian and fish communities while accounting for observational uncertainty and temporal variation in population-level processes. their findings indicate that the most prominent effects of flooding on the amphibian community were caused by changes in the fish community that led to increased predation and resource competition. in their conclusions, the authors emphasize the importance of understanding networks of abiotic and biotic effects if we are to predict and mitigate the influence of extreme weather events.",AB_0581
"polarized resonant soft x-ray scattering (p-rsoxs) has emerged as a powerful synchrotron-based tool that combines the principles of x-ray scattering and x-ray spectroscopy. p-rsoxs provides unique sensitivity to molecular orientation and chemical heterogeneity in soft materials such as polymers and biomaterials. quantitative extraction of orientation information from p-rsoxs pattern data is challenging, however, because the scattering processes originate from sample properties that must be represented as energy-dependent three-dimensional tensors with heterogeneities at nanometre to sub-nanometre length scales. this challenge is overcome here by developing an open-source virtual instrument that uses graphical processing units (gpus) to simulate p-rsoxs patterns from real-space material representations with nanoscale resolution. this computational framework - called cyrsoxs (https://github.com/usnistgov/cyrsoxs) - is designed to maximize gpu performance, including algorithms that minimize both communication and memory footprints. the accuracy and robustness of the approach are demonstrated by validating against an extensive set of test cases, which include both analytical solutions and numerical comparisons, demonstrating an acceleration of over three orders of magnitude relative to the current state-of-the-art p-rsoxs simulation software. such fast simulations open up a variety of applications that were previously computationally unfeasible, including pattern fitting, co-simulation with the physical instrument for operando analytics, data exploration and decision support, data creation and integration into machine learning workflows, and utilization in multi-modal data assimilation approaches. finally, the complexity of the computational framework is abstracted away from the end user by exposing cyrsoxs to python using pybind. this eliminates input/output requirements for large-scale parameter exploration and inverse design, and democratizes usage by enabling seamless integration with a python ecosystem (https://github.com/usnistgov/nrss) that can include parametric morphology generation, simulation result reduction, comparison with experiment and data fitting approaches.",AB_0581
"streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. although multi- valent pneumococcal vaccines have curbed the incidence of disease, their introduction has resulted in shifted serotype distributions that must be monitored. whole genome sequence (wgs) data provide a powerful surveillance tool for tracking isolate serotypes, which can be determined from nucleotide sequence of the capsular polysaccharide biosynthetic operon (cps). although software exists to predict serotypes from wgs data, most are constrained by requiring high- coverage next- generation sequencing reads. this can present a challenge in respect of accessibility and data sharing. here we present pfaster, a machine learning- based method to identify 65 prevalent serotypes from assembled s. pneumoniae genome sequences. pfaster combines dimensionality reduction from k- mer analysis with a random forest classifier for rapid serotype prediction. by leveraging the model's builtin statistical framework, pfaster determines confidence in its predictions without the need for coverage- based assessments. we then demonstrate the robustness of this method, returning >97 % concordance when compared to biochemical results and other in silico serotyping tools. pfaster is open source and available at: https://github.com/pfizer-opensource/pfaster.",AB_0581
"observable dynamics, such as waves propagating on a surface, are generally governed by partial differential equations (pdes), which are determined by the physical properties of the propagation media. the spatial variations of these properties lead to spatially dependent pdes. it is useful in many fields to recover the variations from the observations of dynamical behaviors on the material. a method is proposed to form a map of the physical properties' spatial variations for a material via data-driven spatially dependent pde identification and applied to recover acoustical properties (viscosity, attenuation, and phase speeds) for propagating waves. the proposed data driven pde identification scheme is based on l1-norm minimization. it does not require any pde term that is assumed active from the prior knowledge and is the first approach that is capable of identifying spatially dependent pdes from measurements of phenomena. in addition, the method is efficient as a result of its non-iterative nature and can be robust against noise if used with an integration transformation technique. it is demonstrated in multiple experimental settings, including real laser measurements of a vibrating aluminum plate. codes and data are available online at https://tinyurl.com/4wza8vxs. vc 2023 acoustical society of america.

"background: sacral nerve stimulation is a treatment option for severe, medically refractory fecal incontinence, although its use in patients with anatomic abnormalities remains controversial. objective: this study aimed to determine whether patients with rectoanal intussusception achieve similar benefits from device implantation to patients without rectoanal intussusception. design: retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database. demographics and clinical data were collected for each patient, including preoperative pelvic floor testing. defecographies were reanalyzed in a blinded manner. preoperative rectoanal intussusception was determined on the basis of the oxford system (grade iii-iv vs not; grade v excluded). settings: academic-affiliated pelvic health center. patients: all patients undergoing sacral nerve stimulation for fecal incontinence between july 2011 and july 2019. main outcome measures: cleveland clinic florida incontinence/wexner scores, fecal incontinence severity indices, and fecal incontinence quality of life indices at 1 year. results: one hundred sixty-nine patients underwent sacral nerve stimulation for fecal incontinence during the study period. the average age was 60.3 years and 91% were female. forty-six patients (27.2%) had concomitant rectoanal intussusception (38 patients [22.5%] grade iii and 8 patients [4.7%] grade iv). before surgery, patients reported an average of 10.8 accidents per week and a wexner score of 15.7, with no difference between patients with and without rectoanal intussusception (p = 0.22 and 0.95). at 1 year after surgery, the average wexner score was 9.5. there was no difference in postoperative wexner scores (10.4 vs 9.2, p = 0.23) or improvement over time between patients with and without rectoanal intussusception (-6.7 vs - 5.7, p = 0.40). similarly, there was no difference in quality of life or frequency of incontinence to liquid or solid stool. limitations: single-institution, moderate sample size, incomplete survey response. conclusions: concomitant rectoanal intussusception does not appear to affect clinical outcomes or quality of life after sacral nerve stimulation for fecal incontinence. appropriate patients with fecal incontinence and rectoanal intussusception can be considered for sacral nerve stimulation placement. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c192.",AB_0581
"background: approximately 30% of crohn's disease-related perianal fistulas heal in the adult population with conventional medical and surgical interventions. this healing rate remains unknown in pediatric patients. objective: this study aimed to determine the healing rate of pediatric perianal crohn's fistulas and identify factors associated with healing. design: retrospective case series. setting: a quaternary referral center. patients: patients aged <18 years with a crohn's perianal fistula, seen between january 1, 1991, and august 1, 2021, were included in the study. interventions: multivariable logistic regression to identify factors independently associated with perianal fistula healing. main outcome measures: healing of crohn's perianal fistula at the date of last clinical encounter, defined as the clinical note reporting a healed fistula or normal perianal examination. results: a total of 91 patients aged <18 years with a crohn's disease-related perianal fistula were identified (59% female, 76% white). the mean (sd) age at crohn's diagnosis was 12 (+/- 4) years. the mean follow-up after crohn's diagnosis was 10 (+/- 7) years. overall, 89% of patients had a perianal fistula, 2% had an anovaginal fistula, and 10% had an ileal pouch-associated fistula. patients underwent a median (interquartile range) of 2 (1-5) operations. a seton was placed in 60% of patients, 47% underwent abscess drainage, and 44% underwent fistulotomy or fistulectomy. fistula healing occurred in 71% of patients over a median of 1.3 (0.4-2.5) years. seven patients (7%) underwent proctectomy, and 3 (3%) underwent ileal pouch excision. after multivariable adjustment, younger age at diagnosis of perianal fistula was associated with an increased likelihood of healing (or 0.56 for each increased year; 95% ci, 0.34-0.92). limitations: retrospective, single institution. conclusions: over two-thirds of fistulas heal in pediatric crohn's disease patients with conventional surgical and medical intervention. younger age at fistula development is associated with an increased likelihood of healing. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c185.",AB_0581
"background: up to 10% of patients develop new, persistent opioid use after surgery. we aimed to assess our prescribing practices and patient utilization of opioids after colorectal surgery.objective: this study aimed to implement an opioidprescribing protocol that will minimize the number of postoperative opioids to decrease community circulation and persistent use by patients.design: this was a single-institution, prospective study based on questionnaires of postoperative patients in 2019 and 2020 to determine opioid prescribing and usage patterns. based on these preliminary results, a protocol was implemented in which patients were discharged with 5 or 15 oxycodone 5 mg equivalents based on opioid usage in the 24 hours before discharge. patients were surveyed after protocol implementation.settings: our institution is a large referral center for surgical treatment of colorectal disease.patients: adults who underwent inpatient abdominal colorectal procedures.main outcome measures: end points included the number of opioids prescribed, number of prescribed opioids taken, and refill rate. nonparametric testing was used.results: of 77 eligible patients, 61 were opioid naive. preprotocol, opioid-naive patients (n = 29) were prescribed a median of 30 (interquartile range [iqr], 30-45) tablets but took only 10 (iqr, 0-10; p < 0.0001). eighty-three percent took 20 or fewer tablets. after protocol implementation, opioid-naive patients (n = 32) were prescribed fewer tablets (median 15; iqr, 7-15; p < 0.0001) but took a similar number of tablets as the preprotocol group (median 10; iqr, 0-10; p = 0.21). the refill rate remained similar (13.8% vs 18.8%; p = 0.60). protocol adherence was 90.6%.limitations: this study is limited by sample size, cohort heterogeneity, and generalizability. conclusions: patients took significantly fewer opioids than were prescribed. our protocol limited overprescribing and resulted in fewer opioids in the community without opportunity costs such as increased refills. long-term studies are needed to assess the effects of persistent opioid use after surgery. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c93.",AB_0581
"background: parastomal hernias are common and negatively affect patient's lives. we hypothesized that physical activity (or lack thereof) might be associated with the presence of parastomal hernia. if so, this might be an actionable target for prevention. objective: the objective was to determine rates of and risk factors for parastomal hernias in patients with a permanent ostomy. design: this was a retrospective cohort and survey study. postal survey included questions about parastomal hernia, symptoms, lifestyle, and validated instruments to measure stoma quality of life and physical activity. medical record abstraction was conducted for clinical comorbidities. settings: this study was conducted in a single large academic medical center. patients: patients who underwent operations that included a permanent urostomy, colostomy, and/or ileostomy between 2014 and 2018 were included. main outcome measures: parastomal hernia (self-reported) and physical activity, measured in total metabolic equivalent-minutes/week, were our main outcome measures. results: a total of 443 of 724 patients responded (response rate, 61.2%). two hundred twelve patients (47.9%) had urostomies, 160 (36.1%) had colostomies, and 99 (22.3%) had ileostomies. one hundred twenty-eight patients (29.7%) had a parastomal hernia, with rates of 27.1% for urostomy, 40.0% for colostomy, and 23.7% for ileostomy. there was a statistically significant association between less exercise and higher incidence of parastomal hernia (median, 579 metabolic equivalent-minutes/week for those with parastomal hernias vs 1689 metabolic equivalent-minutes/week for those without; p = 0.001). limitations: the association between physical activity and parastomal hernia may be confounded by obesity or the possibility that patients with parastomal hernia may be limited physically by their hernia. conclusions: parastomal hernia rates remain high in modern surgical practice. this study shows an association between patients' physical activity and the presence of a parastomal hernia, with a higher rate among patients who exercise less. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b910.",AB_0581
