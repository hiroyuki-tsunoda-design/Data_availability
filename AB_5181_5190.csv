"cervical cancer is one of the most concerning carcinogenic diseases among women worldwide. the condition is especially bad in low-or middle-income countries due to the lack of medical facilities. in such situations, computer-aided diagnosis (cad) systems can alleviate the need to a large extent. however, sometimes a single learning model may not be effective enough to capture relevant information for accurate prediction of diseases from complex data. to this end, we propose an ensemble of deep learning models, called mean and standard deviation-based ensemble network (msenet), for detecting cervical cancer from pap smear images. our ensemble model consists of three standard base classifiers, namely xception, inception v3, and vgg-16. we further improve the classification abilities of these models by implementing a novel probability enhancement scheme that takes into account the mean and standard deviation of the confidence scores. this technique enables the overall framework to capture complementary information offered by the base classifiers and is tailored to the characteristics of deep learners. finally, we use the product rule to aggregate the obtained outcomes and get final predictions. the proposed msenet has been evaluated on a standard public benchmark dataset, called sipakmed. with a classification accuracy of 97.21% using a 5-fold cross-validation scheme, the msenet outperforms many state-of-the-art methods. the source codes are made public in the following github repository https://github.com/rishavpramanik/msenet.",AB_0519
"pcb component classification and segmentation can be helpful for pcb waste recycling. however, the variance in shapes and sizes of pcb components presents crucial challenges. we propose pcbsegclassnet, a novel deep neural network for pcb component classification and segmentation. the network uses a two-branch design that captures the global context in one branch and spatial features in the other. the fusion of two branches allows the effective segmentation of components of various sizes and shapes. we reinterpret the skip connections as a learning module to learn features efficiently. we propose a texture enhancement module that utilizes texture information and spatial features to obtain precise boundaries of components. we introduce a loss function that combines dice, iou, and ssim loss functions to guide the training process for precise pixel-level, patch-level, and map-level segmentation. our network outperforms all previous state-of-the-art networks on both segmentation and classification tasks. for example, it achieves a dice score of 96.3% and iou score of 92.7% on the fpic dataset. from the fpic dataset, we crop the images of 25 component classes and term the resultant 19158 images as the fpic-component dataset(we release scripts for obtaining this dataset from fpic dataset). on this dataset, our network achieves a classification accuracy of 95.2%. our model is much more light-weight than previous networks and achieves a segmentation throughput of 122 frame-per-second on a single gpu. we also showcase its ability to count the number of each component on a pcb. the code is available at https://github.com/candlelabai/pcbsegclassnet.",AB_0519
"1. selecting the best subset of covariates out of a panel of many candidates is a key and highly influential stage of the species distribution modelling process. yet, there is currently no commonly accepted and widely adopted standard approach by which to perform this selection. 2. we introduce a two-step embedded covariate selection procedure aimed at optimizing the pre-dictive ability and parsimony of species distribution models fitted in a context of high-dimensional candidate covariate space. the procedure combines a collinearity-filtering algorithm (step a) with three model-specific embedded regularization techniques (step b), including generalized linear model with elastic net regularization, generalized additive model with null-space penalization, and guided regularized random forest. 3. we evaluated the embedded covariate selection procedure through an example application aimed at modelling the habitat suitability of 50 species in switzerland from a suite of 123 candidate covariates. we demonstrated the ability of the embedded covariate selection procedure to provide significantly more accurate species distribution models as compared to models obtained with alternative procedures. model performance was independent of the characteristics of the species data, such as the number of occurrence records or their spatial distribution across the study area. 4. we implemented and streamlined our embedded covariate selection procedure in the covsel r package, paving the way for a ready-to-use, automated, covariate selection tool that was missing in the field of species distribution modelling. all the information required for installing and running the covsel r package is openly available on the github repository https://github.com/n-s dm/covsel.",AB_0519
"the chromosome of archetypal bacteria e. coli is known for a complex topology with a 4.6 x 106 base pairs (bp) long sequence of nucleotides packed within a micrometer-sized cellular confinement. the inherent organization underlying this chromosome eludes general consensus due to the lack of a high-resolution picture of its conformation. here we present our development of an integrative model of e. coli at a 500 bp resolution (https://github.com/jmlab-tifrh/ecoli_finer), which optimally combines a set of multiresolution genome-wide experimentally measured data within a framework of polymer based architecture. in particular the model is informed with an intragenome contact probability map at 5000 bp resolution derived via the hi-c experiment and rna-sequencing data at 500 bp resolution. via dynamical simulations, this data-driven polymer based model generates an appropriate conformational ensemble commensurate with chromosome architectures that e. coli adopts. as a key hallmark of the e. coli chromosome the model spontaneously self-organizes into a set of nonoverlapping macrodomains and suitably locates plectonemic loops near the cell membrane. as novel extensions, it predicts a contact probability map simulated at a higher resolution than precedent experiments and can demonstrate segregation of chromosomes in a partially replicating cell. finally, the modular nature of the model helps us devise control simulations to quantify the individual role of key features in hierarchical organization of the bacterial chromosome.",AB_0519
"open-source md simulation tools provide academics and lowincome countries with the ability to compete in drug discovery advancements. gromacs is a well-known and established md simulation tool, among others. although command-line tools offer full flexibility to users, they require expertise and familiarity with the unix operating system. in this context, we have developed an automated bash workflow that enables users with minimal knowledge of unix or command-line tools to run protein/protein-ligand complex simulations bridged to mm/pbsa calculations. the workflow provides information to the user using zenity widgets and requires minimal intervention, such as energy minimization, simulation duration, and output file naming. it initiates md simulations within a few seconds (energy minimization, nvt, npt, and md) after taking input files and parameters, which takes 20-30 min in a command-line-based protocol. the single workflow also helps users to produce reproducible research results with fewer errors. the workflow is available at the github repository: https://github.com/harry-maan/gmx_qk.",AB_0519
"in this paper, we propose a blind gaussian denoising network that utilize the features of the input image and its negative for generating denoised output of the same. the proposed network is a dual path model which employs a multi-scale pixel attention (mspa) block on one path and a multi-scale feature extraction (msfe) block on another. the concept of using the features of a negative image (that it highlights the low contrast region) in blind gaussian denoising network is, to the best of our knowledge, a first such attempt. the proposed mspa and msfe blocks are designed to focus on the features of the image at multiple scales. the mspa block focuses on the important features of the negative of the input image whereas the msfe block focuses on extracting features of the input noisy image. the features of both the images are then combined and a final residual noise is obtained, subtracting which from the input noisy image produces the final denoised result. the proposed network is lightweight and fast, due to the low number of convolutional layers involved, and produces superior results (both quantitatively and qualitatively) when compared with various traditional and learning based blind gaussian denoising techniques. the code of this paper can be downloaded from https://github.com/rtsir/nifbgdnet .(c) 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0519
"recently, the concept of quantitative read-across structure-activity relationship (q-rasar) has been introduced by using various machine learning (ml) - derived similarity functions in the traditional quantitative structure-activity relationship (qsar) modeling framework with the objective of enhancing the external predictivity of models while using the same available chemical information content. the present study uses the herg k+ channel inhibition cardiotoxicity, a pharmaceutically relevant endpoint, as the modeling set for making predictions using the novel q-rasar approach, as the approach combines the merits of qsar and read-across, and generates simple and interpretable models using various similarity and error-based measures as descriptors. the cardiotoxicity data (in terms of pic50 values) were collected from the literature. the curated data set was then divided into training and test sets using the sorted response-based division algorithm. the important set of features was identified based on the internal validation metrics of initial genetic algorithm models. based on the features selected in the final multiple linear regression (mlr) model, rasar descriptors were computed using a tool available from https://sites.google.com/jadavpuruniversity.in/dtc-lab-software/home. the rasar descriptors were then merged with the previously selected features, and an mlr q-rasar model was generated using the grid search approach. the prediction outliers were then identified using the novel dtc applicability domain plot, and the q-rasar models were used for predictions after the removal of prediction outliers. a final partial least squares (pls) q-rasar model was generated to obviate inter-correlation among descriptors. various other machine learning approaches were also employed with the optimization of relevant hyperparameters based on the cross-validation approach, and the final test set prediction results were compared. based on the performance in the test set predictions and interpretability, the pls q-rasar model was chosen as the final model which provided enhanced predictivity in comparison to previously reported models even without using 3-d descriptors. this model can thus be used for the quick screening of molecules, even before their synthesis, to estimate their cardiotoxic potential thus prioritizing molecules for further experimental testing in the drug discovery pipeline. a java-based prediction tool has also been developed for the quick screening of cardiotoxic properties of query compounds and made available from https://sites.google.com/jadavpuruniversit y.in/dtc-lab-software/home.",AB_0519
"a long-standing target in elucidating the biomolecular recognition process is the identification of binding competent conformations of the receptor protein. however, protein conformational plasticity and the stochastic nature of the recognition processes often preclude the assignment of a specific protein conformation to an individual ligand-bound pose. here, we demonstrate that a computational framework coined as rf-ticamd, which integrates an ensemble decision-tree-based random forest (rf) machine learning (ml) technique with an unsupervised dimension reduction approach time-structured independent component analysis (tica), provides an efficient and unambiguous solution toward resolving protein conformational plasticity and the substrate binding process. in particular, we consider multimicrosecond-long molecular dynamics (md) simulation trajectories of a ligand recognition process in solvent inaccessible cavities of archetypal proteins t4 lysozyme and cytochrome p450cam. we show that in a scenario in which clear correspondence between protein conformation and binding-competent macrostates could not be obtained via an unsupervised dimension reduction approach, an a priori decision-tree-based supervised classification of the simulated recognition trajectories via rf would help characterize key amino acid residue pairs of the protein that are deemed sensitive for ligand binding. a subsequent unsupervised dimensional reduction of the selected residue pairs via tica would then delineate a conformational landscape of protein which is able to demarcate ligand-bound poses from unbound ones. the proposed rf-tica-md approach is shown to be data agnostic and found to be robust when using other ml-based classification methods such as xgboost. as a promising spinoff of the protocol, the framework is found to be capable of identifying distal protein locations which would be allosterically important for ligand binding and would characterize their roles in recognition pathways. a python implementation of a proposed ml workflow is available in github https://github.com/navjeet0211/rf-tica-md.",AB_0519
"metabolic syndrome (mets) is characterized by the presence of at least three interrelated risk factors, including central obesity, hypertension, elevated serum triglycerides, low serum high-density lipoproteins, and insulin resistance. abdominal obesity is considered a predominant risk factor. lifestyle changes with medications to lower cholesterol, blood sugar, and hypertension are the general treatment approaches. functional foods and bioactive food ingredients represent versatile tools for addressing different aspects of mets. in a randomized placebo-controlled clinical study, we evaluated the effect of calebin a, a minor bioactive phytochemical from curcuma longa, on metabolic syndrome in obese adults (n = 100), and 94 individuals completed the study (n = 47 in both groups). they were subjected to calebin a supplementation for 90 days, which resulted in a statistically significant reduction in their body weight, waist circumference, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels compared to those with the placebo. a small but significant increase in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels was also observed in these individuals. furthermore, calebin a showed a positive effect on adipokines by reducing circulating leptin levels. finally, c-reactive protein levels were significantly reduced in calebin a-supplemented individuals, suggesting a beneficial impact on managing mets-induced inflammation. blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, and blood pressure levels were not affected by calebin a. in conclusion, calebin a may be an effective supplement for managing abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, and systemic inflammation in individuals with metabolic syndrome. this study was prospectively registered on the clinical trial registry of india (ctri) with the registration number ctri/2021/09/036495. https://ctri.nic.in/clinicaltrials/advancesearchmain.php",AB_0519
"background and aims: carbohydrate quality may play a key role in cardiometabolic health and disease risk. this study aimed to assess the dietary carbohydrate quality of the free-living middle-aged and older adults in singapore, and its association with overall diet qual-ity and cardiometabolic health.methods and results: this cross-sectional study examined the diet and cardiometabolic disease risk indicators of middle-aged and older adults in singapore (n = 104). dietary carbohydrate quality was assessed as the pass and fail rate of the population to four measures of carbohydrate quality: (i) dietary fiber recommended daily allowance (rda), (ii) whole-grain recommendation, (iii) free sugar recommendation, and (iv) carbohydrate metrics. the association between each carbohydrate quality measure and diet quality, as well as cardiometabolic health, was assessed. except for free sugar recommendation, the carbohydrate quality of the population was found to be poor with a low adherence (20-36%) to three measures. subjects meeting these measures had generally higher intakes of fiber, protein, and most micronutrients compared with subjects who failed. meeting different variants of the carbohydrate metrics was associated with 60% lower odds of pre-hypertensive blood pressure (p = 0.037; p = 0.047), and meeting the dietary fiber rda was associated with lower waist circumference (p = 0.021).conclusion: an improvement in carbohydrate quality is warranted among free-living middle-aged and older adults in singapore. not all measures of carbohydrate quality were equally effec-tive in preserving overall diet quality; the carbohydrate metrics and dietary fiber rda can be identified as effective measures in relation to cardiometabolic disease risk.clinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/clinical trial registration: nct03554954, 13 sept. 2018.(c) 2023 the italian diabetes society, the italian society for the study of atherosclerosis, the italian society of human nutrition and the department of clinical medicine and surgery, federico ii university. published by elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0519
