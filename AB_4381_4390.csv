"the function of an antibody is intrinsically linked to the epitope it engages. clonal clustering methods, based on sequence identity, are commonly used to group antibodies that will bind to the same epitope. however, such methods neglect the fact that antibodies with highly diverse sequences can exhibit similar binding site geometries and engage common epitopes. in a previous study, we described space1, a method that structurally clustered antibodies in order to predict their epitopes. this methodology was limited by the inaccuracies and incomplete coverage of template-based modeling. in addition, it was only benchmarked at the level of domain-consistency on one virus class. here, we present space2, which uses the latest machine learning-based structure prediction technology combined with a novel clustering protocol, and benchmark it on binding data that have epitope-level resolution. on six diverse sets of antigen-specific antibodies, we demonstrate that space2 accurately clusters antibodies that engage common epitopes and achieves far higher dataset coverage than clonal clustering and space1. furthermore, we show that the functionally consistent structural clusters identified by space2 are even more diverse in sequence, genetic lineage, and species origin than those found by space1. these results reiterate that structural data improve our ability to identify antibodies that bind to the same epitope, adding information to sequence-based methods, especially in datasets of antibodies from diverse sources. space2 is openly available on github (https://github.com/oxpig/space2).",AB_0439
"backgroundadvances in four-dimensional flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance (4d flow cmr) have allowed quantification of left ventricular (lv) and right ventricular (rv) blood flow. we aimed to (1) investigate age and sex differences of 4d flow cmr-derived lv and rv relative flow components and kinetic energy (ke) parameters indexed to end-diastolic volume (keiedv) in healthy subjects; and (2) assess the effects of age and sex on these parameters.methodswe performed 4d flow analysis in 163 healthy participants (42% female; mean age 43 & plusmn; 13 years) of a prospective registry study (nct03217240) who were free of cardiovascular diseases. relative flow components (direct flow, retained inflow, delayed ejection flow, residual volume) and multiple phasic keiedv (global, peak systolic, average systolic, average diastolic, peak e-wave, peak a-wave) for both lv and rv were analysed.resultscompared with men, women had lower median lv and rv residual volume, and lv peak and average systolic keiedv, and higher median values of rv direct flow, rv global keiedv, rv average diastolic keiedv, and rv peak e-wave keiedv. anova analysis found there were no differences in flow components, peak and average systolic, average diastolic and global keiedv for both lv and rv across age groups. peak a-wave keiedv increased significantly (r = 0.458 for lv and 0.341 for rv), whereas peak e-wave keiedv (r = - 0.355 for lv and - 0.318 for rv), and keiedv e/a ratio (r = - 0.475 for lv and - 0.504 for rv) decreased significantly, with age.conclusionthese data using state-of-the-art 4d flow cmr show that biventricular flow components and kinetic energy parameters vary significantly by age and sex. age and sex trends should be considered in the interpretation of quantitative measures of biventricular flow.clinical trial registration https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. unique identifier: nct03217240.conclusionthese data using state-of-the-art 4d flow cmr show that biventricular flow components and kinetic energy parameters vary significantly by age and sex. age and sex trends should be considered in the interpretation of quantitative measures of biventricular flow.clinical trial registration https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. unique identifier: nct03217240.",AB_0439
"backgroundunderstanding the mechanism of action (moa) of a compound is an often challenging but equally crucial aspect of drug discovery that can help improve both its efficacy and safety. computational methods to aid moa elucidation usually either aim to predict direct drug targets, or attempt to understand modulated downstream pathways or signalling proteins. such methods usually require extensive coding experience and results are often optimised for further computational processing, making them difficult for wet-lab scientists to perform, interpret and draw hypotheses from.resultsto address this issue, we in this work present maven (mechanism of action visualisation and enrichment), an r/shiny app which allows for gui-based prediction of drug targets based on chemical structure, combined with causal reasoning based on causal protein-protein interactions and transcriptomic perturbation signatures. the app computes a systems-level view of the mechanism of action of the input compound. this is visualised as a sub-network linking predicted or known targets to modulated transcription factors via inferred signalling proteins. the tool includes a selection of msigdb gene set collections to perform pathway enrichment on the resulting network, and also allows for custom gene sets to be uploaded by the researcher. maven is hence a user-friendly, flexible tool for researchers without extensive bioinformatics or cheminformatics knowledge to generate interpretable hypotheses of compound mechanism of action.conclusionsmaven is available as a fully open-source tool at https://github.com/laylagerami/maven with options to install in a docker or singularity container. full documentation, including a tutorial on example data, is available at https://laylagerami.github.io/maven.",AB_0439
"background and objectives: cardiovascular magnetic resonance (cmr) imaging is a powerful modality in functional and anatomical assessment for various cardiovascular diseases. sufficient image quality is essential to achieve proper diagnosis and treatment. a large number of medical images, the variety of imaging artefacts, and the workload of imaging centres are amongst the factors that reveal the necessity of automatic image quality assessment (iqa). however, automated iqa requires access to bulk annotated datasets for training deep learning (dl) models. labelling medical images is a tedious, costly and time-consuming process, which creates a fundamental challenge in proposing dl-based methods for medical applications. this study aims to present a new method for cmr iqa when there is limited access to annotated datasets. methods: the proposed generalised deep meta-learning model can evaluate the quality by learning tasks in the prior stage and then fine-tuning the resulting model on a small labelled dataset of the desired tasks. this model was evaluated on the data of over 6,000 subjects from the uk biobank for five defined tasks, including detecting respiratory motion, cardiac motion, aliasing and gibbs ringing artefacts and images without artefacts. results: the results of extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed model. besides, comparing the model's accuracy with the domain adaptation model indicates a significant difference by using only 64 annotated images related to the desired tasks. conclusion: the proposed model can identify unknown artefacts in images with acceptable accuracy, which makes it suitable for medical applications and quality assessment of large cohorts. code availability: https://github.com/hosseinsimchi/meta-iqa-cmrimages.",AB_0439
"background t-cells play a crucial role in the adaptive immune system by triggering responses against cancer cells and pathogens, while maintaining tolerance against self-antigens, which has sparked interest in the development of various t-cell-focused immunotherapies. however, the identification of antigens recognised by t-cells is low-throughput and laborious. to overcome some of these limitations, computational methods for predicting cd8 + t-cell epitopes have emerged. despite recent developments, most immunogenicity algorithms struggle to learn features of peptide immunogenicity from small datasets, suffer from hla bias and are unable to reliably predict pathology-specific cd8 + t-cell epitopes. methods we developed trap (t-cell recognition potential of hla-i presented peptides), a robust deep learning workflow for predicting cd8 + t-cell epitopes from mhc-i presented pathogenic and self-peptides. trap uses transfer learning, deep learning architecture and mhc binding information to make context-specific predictions of cd8 + t-cell epitopes. trap also detects low-confidence predictions for peptides that differ significantly from those in the training datasets to abstain from making incorrect predictions. to estimate the immunogenicity of pathogenic peptides with low-confidence predictions, we further developed a novel metric, rsat (relative similarity to autoantigens and tumour-associated antigens), as a complementary to 'dissimilarity to self' from cancer studies. results trap was used to identify epitopes from glioblastoma patients as well as sars-cov-2 peptides, and it outperformed other algorithms in both cancer and pathogenic settings. trap was especially effective at extracting immunogenicity-associated properties from restricted data of emerging pathogens and translating them onto related species, as well as minimising the loss of likely epitopes in imbalanced datasets. we also demonstrated that the novel metric termed rsat was able to estimate immunogenic of pathogenic peptides of various lengths and species. trap implementation is available at: https://github.com/chloehj/trap. conclusions this study presents a novel computational workflow for accurately predicting cd8 + t-cell epitopes to foster a better understanding of antigen-specific t-cell response and the development of effective clinical therapeutics.",AB_0439
"one area of active research is the use of natural language processing (nlp) to mine biomedical texts for sets of triples (subject-predicate-object) for knowledge graph (kg) construction. while statistical methods to mine co-occurrences of entities within sentences are relatively robust, accurate relationship extraction is more challenging. herein, we evaluate the global network of biomedical relationships (gnbr), a dataset that uses distributional semantics to model relationships between biomedical entities. the focus of our paper is an evaluation of a subset of the gnbr data; the relationships between chemicals and genes/proteins. we use evotec's structured 'nexus' database of >2.76m chemical-protein interactions as a ground truth to compare with gnbrs relationships and find a micro-averaged precision-recall area under the curve (auc) of 0.50 and a micro-averaged receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve auc of 0.71 across the relationship classes 'inhibits', 'binding', 'agonism' and 'antagonism', when a comparison is made on a sentence-by-sentence basis. we conclude that, even though these micro-average scores are modest, using a high threshold on certain relationship classes like 'inhibits' could yield high fidelity triples that are not reported in structured datasets. we discuss how different methods of processing gnbr data, and the factuality of triples could affect the accuracy of nlp data incorporated into knowledge graphs. we provide a gnbr-nexus(chembl-subset) merged datafile that contains over 20,000 sentences where a protein/gene-chemical co-occur and includes both the gnbr relationship scores as well as the chembl (manually curated) relationships (e.g., 'agonist', 'inhibitor') -this can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8136752. we envisage this being used to aid curation efforts by the drug discovery community.",AB_0439
"hematopoietic stem cells (hsc) are the cells that give rise to all other blood cells and, as such, they are crucial in the healthy development of individuals. wiskott-aldrich syndrome (was) is a severe disorder affecting the regulation of hematopoietic cells and is caused by mutations in the wasp gene. we consider data from a revolutionary gene therapy clinical trial, where hsc harvested from three was patients' bone marrow have been edited and corrected using viral vectors. upon reinfusion into the patient, the hsc multiply and differentiate into other cell types. the aim is to unravel the cell multiplication and cell differentiation process, which has until now remained elusive. this paper models the replenishment of blood lineages resulting from corrected hsc via a multivariate, density-dependent markov process and develops an inferential procedure to estimate the dynamic parameters, given a set of temporally sparsely observed trajectories. starting from the master equation, we derive a system of nonlinear differential equations for the evolution of the first-and second-order moments over time. we use these moment equations in a generalized method-of-moments framework to perform inference. the performance of our proposal has been evaluated by considering different sampling scenarios and measurement errors of various strengths using a simulation study. we also compared it to another state-of-the-art approach and found that our method is statistically more efficient. by applying our method to the was gene therapy data, we found strong evidence for a myeloid-based developmental pathway of hematopoietic cells where fates of lymphoid and myeloid cells remain coupled, even after the loss of erythroid potential. all code used in this manuscript can be found in the online supplementary material, and the latest version of the code is available at https://github.com/dp3ll1n/slcdp_v1.0.",AB_0439

"accurate identification of synergistic treatment combinations and their underlying biological mechanisms is critical across many disease domains, especially cancer. in translational oncology research, preclinical systems, such as patient-derived xenografts (pdx), have emerged as a unique study design evaluating multiple treatments administered to samples from the same human tumor implanted into genetically identical mice. in this paper we propose a novel bayesian probabilistic tree-based framework for pdx data to investigate the hierarchical relationships between treatments by inferring treatment cluster trees, referred to as treatment trees (rx-tree). the framework motivates a new metric of mechanistic similarity between two or more treatments, accounting for inherent uncertainty in tree estimation; treatments with a high estimated similarity have potentially high mechanistic synergy. building upon dirichlet diffusion trees, we derive a closed-form marginal likelihood, encoding the tree structure, which facilitates computationally efficient posterior inference via a new two-stage algorithm. simulation studies demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in recovering the tree structure and treatment similarities. our analyses of a recently collated pdx dataset produce treatment similarity estimates that show a high degree of concordance with known biological mechanisms across treatments in five different cancers. more importantly, we uncover new and potentially effective combination therapies that confer synergistic regulation of specific downstream biological pathways for future clinical investigations. our accompanying code, data, and shiny application for visualization of results are available at: https://github.com/bayesrx/rxtree.",AB_0439
"interactive molecular dynamics simulation in virtual reality (imd-vr) is emerging as a promising technique in molecular science. here, we demonstrate its use in a range of fifteen applications in materials science and heterogeneous catalysis. in this work, the imd-vr package narupa is used with the md package, dl_poly [1]. we show how imd-vr can be used to: (i) investigate the mechanism of lithium fast ion conduction by directing the formation of defects showing that vacancy transport is favoured over interstitialcy mechanisms, and (ii) guide a molecule through a zeolite pore to explore diffusion within zeolites, examining in detail the motion of methyl n-hexanoate in h-zsm-5 zeolite and identifying bottlenecks restricting diffusion. imd-vr allows users to manipulate these systems intuitively, to drive changes in them and observe the resulting changes in structure and dynamics. we make these simulations available, as a resource for both teaching and research. all simulation files, with videos, can be found online (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8252314) and are provided as open-source material.",AB_0439
