"revealing the tertiary structure of proteins holds huge significance as it unveils their vital properties and functions. these intricate three-dimensional configurations comprise diverse interactions including ionic, hydrophobic, and disulfide forces. in certain instances, these structures exhibit missing regions, necessitating the reconstruction of specific segments, thereby resulting in challenges in protein design, which encompasses loop modeling, circular permutation, and interface prediction. to address this problem, we present two pioneering models: pix2pix generative adversarial network (gan) and plm-gan. the pix2pix gan model is adept at generating and inpainting distance matrices of protein structures, whereas the plm-gan model incorporates residual blocks into the u-net network of the gan, building upon the foundation of the pix2pix gan model. to bolster the models' performance, we introduce a novel loss function named the missing to real regions loss (l-mtr) within the gan framework. additionally, we introduce a distinctive approach of pairing two different distance matrices: one representing the native protein structure and the other representing the same structure with a missing region that undergoes changes in each successive epoch. moreover, we extend the reconstruction of missing regions, encompassing up to 30 amino acids and increase the protein length by 128 amino acids. the evaluation of our pix2pix gan and plm-gan models on a random selection of natural proteins (4zcb, 3fjb, and 2rez) demonstrated promising experimental results. our models constitute significant contributions to addressing intricate challenges in protein structure design. these contributions hold immense potential to propel advancements in protein-protein interactions, drug design, and further innovations in protein engineering. data, code, trained models, examples, and measurements are available on https://github.com/mena01/plm-gan-a-large-scale-protein-loop-modeling-using-pix2pix-gan_.",AB_0416
"introductioncontact centres have higher levels of sedentary behaviour than other office-based workplaces. stand up for health (suh) is a theory-based intervention developed using the 6squid framework to reduce sedentary behaviour in contact centre workers. the aim of this study was to test acceptability and feasibility of implementing suh in uk contact centres.methodsthe study was conducted in 2020-2022 (pre covid and during lockdown) and used a stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial design including a process evaluation. the intervention included working with contact centre managers to develop and implement a customised action plan aligning with suh's theory of change. workplace sedentary time, measured using activpal (tm) devices, was the primary outcome. secondary outcomes included productivity, mental wellbeing, musculoskeletal health and physical activity. empirical estimates of between-centre standard deviation and within-centre standard deviation of outcomes from pre-lockdown data were calculated to inform sample size calculations for future trials. the process evaluation adopted the re-aim framework to understand acceptability and feasibility of implementing the intervention. interviews and focus groups were conducted with contact centre employees and managers, and activity preferences were collected using a questionnaire.resultsa total of 11 contact centres participated: 155 employees from 6 centres in the pre-lockdown data collection, and 54 employees from 5 centres post-lockdown. interviews and focus groups were conducted with 33 employees and managers, and 96 participants completed an intervention activity preference questionnaire. overall, the intervention was perceived as acceptable and feasible to deliver. most centres implemented several intervention activities aligned with suh's theory of change and over 50% of staff participated in at least one activity (pre-lockdown period). perceived benefits including reduced sedentary behaviour, increased physical activity, and improved staff morale and mood were reported by contact centre employees and managers.conclusionssuh demonstrates potential as an appealing and acceptable intervention, impacting several wellbeing outcomes.trial registrationthe trial has been registered on the isrctndatabase: http://www.isrctn.com/isrctn11580369.",AB_0416
"backgroundvariability in datasets is not only the product of biological processes: they are also the product of technical biases. combat and combat-seq are among the most widely used tools for correcting those technical biases, called batch effects, in, respectively, microarray and rna-seq expression data.resultsin this technical note, we present a new python implementation of combat and combat-seq. while the mathematical framework is strictly the same, we show here that our implementations: (i) have similar results in terms of batch effects correction; (ii) are as fast or faster than the original implementations in r and; (iii) offer new tools for the bioinformatics community to participate in its development. pycombat is implemented in the python language and is distributed under gpl-3.0 (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license as a module of the inmoose package. source code is available at https://github.com/epigenelabs/inmoose and python package at https://pypi.org/project/inmoose.conclusionswe present a new python implementation of state-of-the-art tools combat and combat-seq for the correction of batch effects in microarray and rna-seq data. this new implementation, based on the same mathematical frameworks as combat and combat-seq, offers similar power for batch effect correction, at reduced computational cost.",AB_0416
"peptides that pass through the blood-brain barrier (bbb) not only are implicated in brain-related pathologies but also are promising therapeutic tools for treating brain diseases, e.g., as shuttles carrying active medicines across the bbb. computational prediction of bbb-penetrating peptides (b3pps) has emerged as an interesting approach because of its ability to screen large peptide libraries in a cost-effective manner. in this study, we present brainpeppass, a machine learning (ml) framework that utilizes supervised manifold dimensionality reduction and extreme gradient boosting (xgb) algorithms to predict natural and chemically modified b3pps. the results indicate that the proposed tool outperforms other classifiers, with average accuracies exceeding 94% and 98% in 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation (loocv), respectively. in addition, accuracy values ranging from 45% to 97.05% were achieved in the independent tests. the brainpeppass tool is available in a public repository for academic use (https://github.com/ewerton-cristhian/brainpeppass).",AB_0416
"the greenland climate network (gc-net) consists of 31 automatic weather stations (awss) at 30 sites across the greenland ice sheet. the first site was initiated in 1990, and the project has operated almost continuously since 1995 under the leadership of the late konrad steffen. the gc-net aws measured air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, downward and reflected shortwave irradiance, net radiation, and ice and firn temperatures. the majority of the gc-net sites were located in the ice sheet accumulation area (17 awss), while 11 awss were located in the ablation area, and two sites (three awss) were located close to the equilibrium line altitude. additionally, three awss of similar design to the gc-net aws were installed by konrad steffen's team on the larsen c ice shelf, antarctica. after more than 3 decades of operation, the gc-net awss are being decommissioned and replaced by new awss operated by the geological survey of denmark and greenland (geus). therefore, making a reassessment of the historical gc-net aws data is necessary. we present a full reprocessing of the historical gc-net aws dataset with increased attention to the filtering of erroneous measurements, data correction and derivation of additional variables: continuous surface height, instrument heights, surface albedo, turbulent heat fluxes, and 10 m ice and firn temperatures. this new augmented gc-net level-1 (l1) aws dataset is now available at 10.22008/fk2/vvxgut (steffen et al., 2023) and will continue to be refined. the processing scripts, latest data and a data user forum are available at https://github.com/geus-glaciology-and-climate/gc-net-level-1-data-processing (last access: 30 november 2023). in addition to the aws data, a comprehensive compilation of valuable metadata is provided: maintenance reports, yearly pictures of the stations and the station positions through time. this unique dataset provides more than 320 station years of high-quality atmospheric data and is available following fair (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data and code practices.",AB_0416
"background:acute kidney injury (aki) represents a common and serious complication to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. the importance of post-resuscitation care targets for blood pressure and oxygenation for the development of aki is unknown.methods:this is a substudy of a randomized 2-by-2 factorial trial, in which 789 comatose adult patients who had out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with presumed cardiac cause and sustained return of spontaneous circulation were randomly assigned to a target mean arterial blood pressure of either 63 or 77 mm hg. patients were simultaneously randomly assigned to either a restrictive oxygen target of a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (pao2) of 9 to 10 kpa or a liberal oxygenation target of a pao2 of 13 to 14 kpa. the primary outcome for this study was aki according to kdigo (kidney disease: improving global outcomes) classification in patients surviving at least 48 hours (n=759). adjusted logistic regression was performed for patients allocated to high blood pressure and liberal oxygen target as reference.results:the main population characteristics at admission were: age, 64 (54-73) years; 80% male; 90% shockable rhythm; and time to return of spontaneous circulation, 18 (12-26) minutes. patients allocated to a low blood pressure and liberal oxygen target had an increased risk of developing aki compared with patients with high blood pressure and liberal oxygen target (84/193 [44%] versus 56/187 [30%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.87 [95% ci, 1.21-2.89]). multinomial logistic regression revealed that the increased risk of aki was only related to mild-stage aki (kdigo stage 1). there was no difference in risk of aki in the other groups. plasma creatinine remained high during hospitalization in the low blood pressure and liberal oxygen target group but did not differ between groups at 6- and 12-month follow-up.conclusions:in comatose patients who had been resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, patients allocated to a combination of a low mean arterial blood pressure and a liberal oxygen target had a significantly increased risk of mild-stage aki. no difference was found in terms of more severe aki stages or other kidney-related adverse outcomes, and creatinine had normalized at 1 year after discharge.registration:url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct03141099.",AB_0416
"motivation: when analyzing 1d time series, scientists are often interested in identifying regions where one variable depends linearly on the other. typically, they use an ad hoc and therefore often subjective method to do so. results: here, we develop a statistically rigorous, bayesian approach to infer the optimal partitioning of a dataset not only into contiguous piecewise linear segments, but also into contiguous segments described by linear combinations of arbitrary basis functions. we therefore present a general solution to the problem of identifying discontinuous change points. focusing on microbial growth, we use the algorithm to find the range of optical density where this density is linearly proportional to the number of cells and to automatically find the regions of exponential growth for both escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae. for budding yeast, we consequently are able to infer the monod constant for growth on fructose. our algorithm lends itself to automation and high throughput studies, increases reproducibility, and should facilitate data analyses for a broad range of scientists. availability and implementation: the corresponding python package, entitled nunchaku, is available at pypi: https://pypi.org/project/nunchaku.",AB_0416
"background: the rapid evolution of electronic cigarette (e -cigarette) products warrants surveillance of the differences in exposure across device types modifiable devices (mods), cartridge ('' pod '') -containing devices (pods), disposable pods (d-pods) and flavors of the products available on the market. objective: this study aimed to measure and compare metal aerosol concentrations by device type and common flavors. methods: we collected aerosol from 104 mods, 67 pods (four brands:.1111.111., bo, suorin, phix), and 23 d-pods (three brands: zpod, bidi, stig) via droplet deposition in a series of conical pipette tips. metals and metalloids [aluminum (al), arsenic (as), cobalt (co), chromium (cr), copper (cu), iron (fe), manganese (mn), nickel (ni), lead (pb), antimony (sb), tin (sn), and zinc (zn)] were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (1cp-ms), results were log-transformed for statistical analysis, and concentrations are reported in aerosol units (mg/m3). results: of the 12 elements analyzed, concentrations were statistically significantly higher in mod devices, except for co and ni, which were higher in pods and cl-pods. of the pod brands analyzed, pf11x had the highest median concentrations among four metals (al, ni, pb, and sn) compared to the rest of the pod brands. according to pod flavor, seven metals were three to seven orders of magnitude higher in tobacco-flavored aerosol compared to those in mint and mango flavors. among the cl-pod brands, concentrations of four metals (al, cu, ni, and pb) were higher in the zpod brand than in bidi stick and stig devices. according to d -pod flavor, only cr concentrations were found to be statistically significantly higher in mint than tobacco-flavored d-pods. discussion: we observed wide variability in aerosol metal concentrations within and between the different e -cigarette device types, brands, and flavors. overall, mod devices generated aerosols with higher metal concentrations than pods and d-pods, and tobacco-flavored aerosols contained the highest metal concentrations. continued research is needed to evaluate additional factors (i.e., nicotine type) that contribute to metal exposure from new and emerging e -cigarette devices in order to inform policy. https://cloi.org/10.1289/ehp11921",AB_0416
"the inherent diversity of approaches in proteomics research has led to a wide range of software solutions for data analysis. these software solutions encompass multiple tools, each employing different algorithms for various tasks such as peptide-spectrum matching, protein inference, quantification, statistical analysis, and visualization. to enable an unbiased comparison of commonly used bottom-up label-free proteomics workflows, we introduce wombat-p, a versatile platform designed for automated benchmarking and comparison. wombat-p simplifies the processing of public data by utilizing the sample and data relationship format for proteomics (sdrf-proteomics) as input. this feature streamlines the analysis of annotated local or public proteomexchange data sets, promoting efficient comparisons among diverse outputs. through an evaluation using experimental ground truth data and a realistic biological data set, we uncover significant disparities and a limited overlap in the quantified proteins. wombat-p not only enables rapid execution and seamless comparison of workflows but also provides valuable insights into the capabilities of different software solutions. these benchmarking metrics are a valuable resource for researchers in selecting the most suitable workflow for their specific data sets. the modular architecture of wombat-p promotes extensibility and customization. the software is available at https://github.com/wombat-p/wombat-pipelines.",AB_0416
"power line maintenance and inspection are essential to avoid power supply interruptions, reducing its high social and financial impacts yearly. automating power line visual inspections remains a relevant open problem for the industry due to the lack of public real-world datasets of power line components and their various defects to foster new research. this paper introduces insplad, a power line asset inspection dataset and benchmark containing 10,607 high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicles colour images. the dataset contains 17 unique power line assets captured from real-world operating power lines. additionally, five of those assets present six defects: four of which are corrosion, one is a broken component, and one is a bird's nest presence. all assets were labelled according to their condition, whether normal or the defect name found on an image level. we thoroughly evaluate state-of-the-art and popular methods for three image-level computer vision tasks covered by insplad: object detection, through the ap metric; defect classification, through balanced accuracy; and anomaly detection, through the auroc metric. insplad offers various vision challenges from uncontrolled environments, such as multi-scale objects, multi-size class instances, multiple objects per image, intra-class variation, cluttered background, distinct point-of-views, perspective distortion, occlusion, and varied lighting conditions. to the best of our knowledge, insplad is the first large real-world dataset and benchmark for power line asset inspection with multiple components and defects for various computer vision tasks, with a potential impact to improve state-of-the-art methods in the field. it will be publicly available in its integrity on a repository with a thorough description. it can be found at https://github.com/andreluizbvs/insplad/.",AB_0416
