"this research focuses on the discovery and localization of hidden objects in the wild and serves unmanned systems. through empirical analysis, infrared and visible image fusion (ivif) enables hard-to-find objects apparent, whereas multimodal salient object detection (sod) accurately delineates the precise spatial location of objects within the picture. their common characteristic of seeking complementary cues from different source images motivates us to explore the collaborative relationship between fusion and salient object detection tasks on infrared and visible images via an interactively reinforced multi-task paradigm for the first time, termed irfs. to the seamless bridge of multimodal image fusion and sod tasks, we specifically develop a feature screening-based fusion subnetwork (fsfnet) to screen out interfering features from source images, thereby preserving saliency-related features. after generating the fused image through fsfnet, it is then fed into the subsequent fusion-guided cross-complementary sod subnetwork (fc2net) as the third modality to drive the precise prediction of the saliency map by leveraging the complementary information derived from the fused image. in addition, we develop an interactive loop learning strategy to achieve the mutual reinforcement of ivif and sod tasks with a shorter training period and fewer network parameters. comprehensive experiment results demonstrate that the seamless bridge of ivif and sod mutually enhances their performance, and highlights their superiority. this code is available at https://github.com/wdhudiekou/irfs.",AB_0247
"terpenoids and their derivatives are collectively known as the terpenome and are the largest class of natural products, whose biosynthesis refers to various kinds of enzymes. to date, there is no terpenome-related enzyme database, which is a desire for enzyme mining, metabolic engineering and discovery of new natural products related to terpenoids. in this work, we have constructed a comprehensive database called teroenz (http://terokit.qmclab.com/browse_enz.html) containing 13462 enzymes involved in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway, covering 2541 species and 4293 reactions reported in the literature and public databases. at the same time, we classify enzymes according to their catalytic reactions into cyclase, oxidoreductase, transferase, and so on, and also make a classification according to species. this meticulous classification is beneficial for users as it can be retrieved and downloaded conveniently. we also provide a computational module for isozyme prediction. moreover, a module named teromap (http://terokit.qmclab.com/browse_rxn.html) is also constructed to organize all available terpenoid enzymatic reactions into an interactive network by interfacing with the previously established database of terpenoid compounds, teromol. finally, all these databases and modules are integrated into the web server terokit (http://terokit.qmclab.com/) to shed light on the field of terpenoid research.",AB_0247
"determining intrinsically disordered regions of proteins is essential for elucidating protein biological functions and the mechanisms of their associated diseases. as the gap between the number of experimentally determined protein structures and the number of protein sequences continues to grow exponentially, there is a need for developing an accurate and computationally efficient disorder predictor. however, current single-sequence-based methods are of low accuracy, while evolutionary profile-based methods are computationally intensive. here, we proposed a fast and accurate protein disorder predictor lmdisorder that employed embedding generated by unsupervised pretrained language models as features. we showed that lmdisorder performs best in all single-sequence-based methods and is comparable or better than another language-model-based technique in four independent test sets, respectively. furthermore, lmdisorder showed equivalent or even better performance than the state-of-the-art profile-based technique spot-disorder2. in addition, the high computation efficiency of lmdisorder enabled proteome-scale analysis of human, showing that proteins with high predicted disorder content were associated with specific biological functions. the datasets, the source codes, and the trained model are available at https://github.com/biomed-ai/lmdisorder.",AB_0247
"background: current proteomic technologies are fast-evolving to uncover the complex features of sequence processes, variations and modifications. thus, protein sequence database and the corresponding softwares should also be improved to solve this issue. results: we developed a state-of-the-art toolkit (seqwiz) for constructing next-generation sequence databases and performing proteomic-centric sequence analyses. first, we proposed two derived data formats: sqpd (a well-structured and high-performance local sequence database based on sqlite), and set (an associated list of selected entries based on json). the sqpd format follows the basic standards of the emerging peff format, which also aims to facilitate the search of complex proteoform. the set format is designed for generating subsets with with high-efficiency. these formats are shown to greatly outperform the conventional fasta or peff formats in time and resource consumption. then, we mainly focused on the uniprot knowledgebase and developed a collection of open-source tools and basic modules for retrieving species-specific databases, formats conversion, sequence generation, sequence filter, and sequence analysis. these tools are implemented by using the python language and licensed under the gnu general public licence v3. the source codes and distributions are freely available at github (https://github.com/fountao/protwiz/tree/main/seqwiz). conclusions: seqwiz is designed to be a collection of modularized tools, which is friendly to both end-users for preparing easy-to-use sequence databases as well as bioinformaticians for performing downstream sequence analysis. besides the novel formats, it also provides compatible functions for handling the traditional text based fasta or peff formats. we believe that seqwiz will promote the implementing of complementary proteomics for data renewal and proteoform analysis to achieve precision proteomics. additionally, it can also drive the improvement of proteomic standardization and the development of next-generation proteomic softwares.",AB_0247
"to balance the annotation labor and the granularity of supervision, single-frame annotation has been introduced in temporal action localization. it provides a rough temporal location for an action but implicitly overstates the supervision from the annotated-frame during training, leading to the confusion between actions and backgrounds, i.e., action incompleteness and background false positives. to tackle the two challenges, in this work, we present the snippet classification model and the dilation-erosion module. in the dilation-erosion module, we expand the potential action segments with a loose criterion to alleviate the problem of action incompleteness and then remove the background from the potential action segments to alleviate the problem of action incompleteness. relying on the single-frame annotation and the output of the snippet classification, the dilation-erosion module mines pseudo snippet-level ground-truth, hard backgrounds and evident backgrounds, which in turn further trains the snippet classification model. it forms a cyclic dependency. furthermore, we propose a new embedding loss to aggregate the features of action instances with the same label and separate the features of actions from backgrounds. experiments on thumos14 and activitynet 1.2 validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. code has been made publicly available (https://github.com/lingjun123/single-frame-tal).",AB_0247
"protein-deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) interactions are important in a variety of biological processes. accurately predicting protein dna binding affinity has been one of the most attractive and challenging issues in computational biology. however, the existing approaches still have much room for improvement. in this work, we propose an ensemble model for protein-dna binding affinity prediction (empdba), which combines six base models with one meta-model. the complexes are classified into four types based on the dna structure (double-stranded or other forms) and the percentage of interface residues. for each type, empdba is trained with the sequence-based, structure-based and energy features from binding partners and complex structures. through feature selection by the sequential forward selection method, it is found that there do exist considerable differences in the key factors contributing to intermolecular binding affinity. the complex classification is beneficial for the important feature extraction for binding affinity prediction. the performance comparison of our method with other peer ones on the independent testing dataset shows that empdba outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with the pearson correlation coefficient of 0.53 and the mean absolute error of 1.11 kcal/mol. the comprehensive results demonstrate that our method has a good performance for protein-dna binding affinity prediction.availability and implementation: the source code is available at https://github.com/chunhualilab/empdba/.",AB_0247
"motivation: predicting molecular properties is one of the fundamental problems in drug design and discovery. in recent years, self-supervised learning (ssl) has shown its promising performance in image recognition, natural language processing, and single-cell data analysis. contrastive learning (cl) is a typical ssl method used to learn the features of data so that the trained model can more effectively distinguish the data. one important issue of cl is how to select positive samples for each training example, which will significantly impact the performance of cl.results: in this article, we propose a new method for molecular property prediction (mpp) by contrastive learning with attention-guided positive-sample selection (claps). first, we generate positive samples for each training example based on an attention-guided selection scheme. second, we employ a transformer encoder to extract latent feature vectors and compute the contrastive loss aiming to distinguish positive and negative sample pairs. finally, we use the trained encoder for predicting molecular properties. experiments on various benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (sota) methods in most cases.availability and implementation: the code is publicly available at https://github.com/wangjx22/claps.",AB_0247
"understanding autoimmunity to endogenous proteins iscrucial indiagnosing and treating autoimmune diseases. in this work, we developeda user-friendly aagatlas portal (http://biokb.ncpsb.org.cn/aagatlas_portal/index.php#), which can be used to search for 8045 non-redundant autoantigens(aags) and 47 post-translationally modified aags against1073 human diseases that are prioritized by a credential score developedby multisource evidence. using aagatlas, the immunogenic propertiesof human aags was systematically elucidated according to their genetic,biophysical, cytological, expression profile, and evolutionary characteristics.the results indicated that human aags are evolutionally conservedin protein sequence and enriched in three hydrophilic and polar aminoacid residues (k, d, and e) that are located at the protein surface.aags are enriched in proteins that are involved in nucleic acid binding,transferase, and the cytoskeleton. genome, transcriptome, and proteomeanalyses further indicated that aab production is associated withgene variance and abnormal protein expression related to the pathologicalactivities of different tumors. collectively, our data outlines thehallmarks of human aags that facilitate the understanding of humoralautoimmunity and the identification of biomarkers of human diseases.",AB_0247
"motivation: liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry is widely used in composition profiling in untargeted metabolomics research. while retaining complete sample information, mass spectrometry (ms) data naturally have the characteristics of high dimensionality, high complexity, and huge data volume. in mainstream quantification methods, none of the existing methods can perform direct 3d analysis on lossless profile ms signals. all software simplify calculations by dimensionality reduction or lossy grid transformation, ignoring the full 3d signal distribution of ms data and resulting in inaccurate feature detection and quantification. results: on the basis that the neural network is effective for high-dimensional data analysis and can discover implicit features from large amounts of complex data, in this work, we propose 3d-msnet, a novel deep learning-based model for untargeted feature extraction. 3d-msnet performs direct feature detection on 3d ms point clouds as an instance segmentation task. after training on a self-annotated 3d feature dataset, we compared our model with nine popular software (ms-dial, mzmine 2, xcms online, markerview, compound discoverer, maxquant, dinosaur, deepiso, pointiso) on two metabolomics and one proteomics public benchmark datasets. our 3d-msnet model outperformed other software with significant improvement in feature detection and quantification accuracy on all evaluation datasets. furthermore, 3d-msnet has high feature extraction robustness and can be widely applied to profile ms data acquired with various high-resolution mass spectrometers with various resolutions. availability and implementation: 3d-msnet is an open-source model and is freely available at https://github.com/ csi-studio/3d-msnet under a permissive license. benchmark datasets, training dataset, evaluation methods, and results are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6582912.",AB_0247
"motivation: testing the association between multiple phenotypes with a set of genetic variants simultaneously, rather than analyzing one trait at a time, is receiving increasing attention for its high statistical power and easy explanation on pleiotropic effects. the kernel-based association test (kat), being free of data dimensions and structures, has proven to be a good alternative method for genetic association analysis with multiple phenotypes. however, kat suffers from substantial power loss when multiple phenotypes have moderate to strong correlations. to handle this issue, we propose a maximum kat (maxkat) and suggest using the generalized extreme value distribution to calculate its statistical significance under the null hypothesis. results: we show that maxkat reduces computational intensity greatly while maintaining high accuracy. extensive simulations demonstrate that maxkat can properly control type i error rates and obtain remarkably higher power than kat under most of the considered scenarios. application to a porcine dataset used in biomedical experiments of human disease further illustrates its practical utility. availability and implementation: the r package maxkat that implements the proposed method is available on github https://github.com/ wangjj-xrk/maxkat.",AB_0247
