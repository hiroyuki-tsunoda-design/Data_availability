"the prediction of disordered regionsin proteins is crucialforunderstanding their functions, dynamics, and interactions. intrinsicallydisordered proteins (idps) play a key role in many biological processeslike cell signaling, recognition, and regulation, but experimentallydetermining these regions can be challenging due to their high mobility.to address this challenge, we present an algorithm called hydrodispred(hdp). hdp uses a single parameter, the fraction of hydrophobicity(& lambda;) in each segment of the protein, to accurately predict disorderedregions. the algorithm was validated using experimental data fromthe disprot database and was found to be on par and, in some cases,more effective than the existing algorithms. hdp is a simple and effectivemethod for identifying disordered regions in proteins, and its predictionis not affected by the availability of training data, unlike otherml approaches. the application is housed in the web server and canbe accessed through the url https://proseqanalyser.iitgn.ac.in/hydrodispred/.",AB_0513
"long non-coding-rnas (lncrnas) are an expanding set of cis-/trans-regulatory rna genes that outnumber the protein-coding genes. although being increasingly discovered, the functional role of the majority of lncrnas in diverse biological conditions is undefined. increasing evidence supports the critical role of lncrnas in the emergence, regulation, and progression of various viral infections including influenza, hepatitis, coronavirus, and human immunodeficiency virus. hence, the identification of signature lncrnas would facilitate focused analysis of their functional roles accounting for their targets and regulatory mechanisms associated with infections. towards this, we compiled 2803 lncrnas identified to be modulated by 33 viral strains in various mammalian cell types and are provided through the resource named virhostlncr (http://ciods.in/virhostlncr/). the information on each of the viral strains, their multiplicity of infection, duration of infection, host cell name and cell types, fold change of lncrna expression, and their specific identification methods are integrated into virhostlncr. based on the current datasets, we report 150 lncrnas including differentiation antagonizing nonprotein coding rna (dancr), metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (malat1), maternally expressed gene 3 (meg3), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (neat1), and plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (pvt1) to be perturbed by two or more viruses. analysis of viral protein interactions with human transcription factors (tfs) or tf-containing protein complexes identified that distinct viruses can transcriptionally regulate many of these lncrnas through multiple protein complexes. together, we believe that the current dataset will enable priority selection of lncrnas for identification of their targets and serve as an effective platform for the analysis of noncoding rna-mediated regulations in viral infections.",AB_0513
"contemporary deep learning methods for image reconstruction have shown promising results over classical methods. however, they are not robust to image alterations due to deviations in the imaging conditions at test time. the training process does not account for explicit variations in the contextual information about the imaging task, such as image control parameters and input settings that could hold a causal relationship to the visual content of the reconstructed image. in this work, we propose dynamic weight prediction (dwp) networks to learn the contextual settings and the relationships between them. this model-based meta-learning approach would offer two valuable capabilities in a single network - (i) scalability to multiple input settings and (ii) tunability to continuously varying control settings with the knowledge of a few settings. the proposed network, mci-hypernet, is a controllable image reconstruction network with dwp sub-networks conditioned on multiple contextual settings. the proposed approach strikes a balance between reliable context-adaptive weight learning and context-agnostic weight learning to obtain robust image reconstructions. we have extensively experimented with our network for accelerated mri reconstruction considering the essential research directions provided in the fastmri challenge results. the proposed method exhibits (i) superior reconstruction quality with improvement margins of similar to 0.5 db in psnr and similar to 0.01 in ssim over adaptive reconstruction methods for cardiac mri and multiple brain mri contrasts, (ii) better scalability to multiple anatomies, contrasts, and under-sampling mask patterns with accuracy improvement margins of similar to 0.2 db in psnr and similar to 0.005 in ssim over joint training and context-specific models for knee mri, and (iii) generality to 40 arbitrary acceleration factors over joint training when trained on just five acceleration factors. our model can learn multiple contrast sequences through continual learning without catastrophically forgetting old mri sequences. furthermore, our method is benchmarked for reconstruction quality against other mri reconstruction architectures trained for a specific contextual setting. besides, an interpretability analysis using a relational knowledge distillation measure shows that our model exhibits superior context-specific and relational knowledge across contexts over jointly trained models. our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/sriprabhar/mci-hypernet.",AB_0513
"the main robustness issue of state-of-the-art frame field based hexahedral mesh generation algorithms originates from non-meshable topological configurations, which do not admit the construction of an integer-grid map but frequently occur in smooth frame fields. in this article, we investigate the topology of frame fields and derive conditions on their meshability, which are the basis for a novel algorithm to automatically turn a given non-meshable frame field into a similar but locally meshable one. despite local meshability is only a necessary but not sufficient condition for the stronger requirement of meshability, our algorithm increases the 2% success rate of generating valid integer-grid maps with state-of-the-art methods to 58%, when compared on the challenging hexme dataset [beaufort et al. 2022]. the source code of our implementation and the data of our experiments are available at https://lib.algohex.eu.",AB_0513

"proteomic studiestypically involve the use of different typesof software for annotating experimental tandem mass spectrometricdata (ms/ms) and thereby simplifying the process of peptide and proteinidentification. for such annotations, these softwares calculate the m/z values of the peptide/protein precursorand fragment ions, for which a database of protein sequences mustbe provided as an input file. the calculated m/z values are stored as another database, which the userusually cannot view. database creator for mass analysis of peptidesand proteins (dc-mapp) is a novel standalone software that can createcustom databases for viewing the calculated m/z values of precursor and fragment ions,prior to the database search. it contains three modules. peptide/proteinsequences as per user's choice can be entered as input to thefirst module for creating a custom database. in the second module, m/z values must be queried-in, which aresearched within the custom database to identify protein/peptide sequences.the third module is suited for peptide mass fingerprinting, whichcan be used to analyze both esi and maldi mass spectral data. thefeature of viewing the custom database can be helpfulnot only for better understanding the search engine processes, butalso for designing multiple reaction monitoring (mrm) methods. post-translationalmodifications and protein isoforms can also be analyzed. since, dc-mapprelies on the protein/peptide sequences for creatingcustom databases, it may not be applicable for the searches involvingspectral libraries. python language was used for implementation, andthe graphical user interface was built with page/tcl, making thistool more user-friendly. it is freely available at https://vit.ac.in/dc-mapp/.",AB_0513
"identifying lowly prevalent diseases, or rare diseases, in their early stages is key to disease treatment in the medical field. deep learning techniques now provide promising tools for this purpose. nevertheless, the low prevalence of rare diseases entangles the proper application of deep networks for disease identification due to the severe class-imbalance issue. in the past decades, some balancing methods have been studied to handle the data-imbalance issue. the bad news is that it is verified that none of these methods guarantees superior performance to others. this performance variation causes the need to formulate a systematic pipeline with a comprehensive software tool for enhancing deep-learning applications in rare disease identification. we reviewed the existing balancing schemes and summarized a systematic deep ensemble pipeline with a constructed tool called rddl for handling the data imbalance issue. through two real case studies, we showed that rare disease identification could be boosted with this systematic rddl pipeline tool by lessening the data imbalance problem during model training. the rddl pipeline tool is available at https://github.com/cobislab/ rddl/.",AB_0513
"meta-learning has recently been an emerging data-efficient learning technique for various medical imaging operations and has helped advance contemporary deep learning models. furthermore, meta -learning enhances the knowledge generalization of the imaging tasks by learning both shared and discriminative weights for various configurations of imaging tasks during training. however, existing meta-learning models attempt to learn a single set of weight initializations of a neural network that might be fundamentally restrictive under the heterogeneous (multimodal) data scenario. this work aims to develop a multimodal meta-learning model for image reconstruction, which augments meta -learning with evolutionary capabilities to encompass diverse acquisition settings of heterogeneous data. our proposed model called km-maml (kernel modulation-based multimodal meta -learning), has hypernetworks (auxiliary learners) that evolve to generate mode-specific (or context-specific) weights. these weights provide the mode-specific inductive bias for multiple modes by re-calibrating each kernel of the base network for image reconstruction via a low-rank kernel modulation operation. furthermore, we incorporate gradient-based meta-learning (gbml) in the contextual space to update the weights of the hypernetworks based on different modes. the hypernetworks and the base reconstruction network in the gbml setting provide discriminative mode-specific features and low-level image features, respectively. we extensively evaluate our model for multi-contrast magnetic resonance image reconstruction considering the essential research directions in fastmri for multimodal and rich transfer learning capabilities across various mri contrasts. our comparative studies show that the proposed model (i) exhibits superior reconstruction performance over joint training, other meta-learning methods, and various context-specific mri reconstruction architectures, and (ii) better adaptation to 80% and 92% of unseen multi-contrast data contexts with improvement margins of 0.1 to 0.5 db in psnr and around 0.01 in ssim, respectively. besides, a representation analysis with u-net as the base network shows that kernel modulation infuses 80% of mode-specific representation changes in the high-resolution layers. our source code is available at https://github.com/sriprabhar/km-maml/.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0513
"the incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a continuously growing health problem worldwide, along with obesity. therefore, novel methods to both efficiently study the manifestation of nonalco-holic fatty liver disease and to analyze drug efficacy in preclinical models are needed. the present study developed a deep neural network-based model to quantify microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis in the liver on hematoxylin-eosin-stained whole slide images, using the cloud-based platform, aiforia create. the training data included a total of 101 whole slide images from dietary interventions of wild-type mice and from two genetically modified mouse models with steatosis. the algorithm was trained for the following: to detect liver parenchyma, to exclude the blood vessels and any artefacts generated during tissue processing and image acquisition, to recognize and differentiate the areas of micro-vesicular and macrovesicular steatosis, and to quantify the recognized tissue area. the results of the image analysis replicated well the evaluation by expert pathologists and correlated well with the liver fat content measured by echomri ex vivo, and the correlation with total liver triglycerides was notable. in conclusion, the developed deep learning-based model is a novel tool for studying liver steatosis in mouse models on paraffin sections and, thus, can facilitate reliable quantification of the amount of steatosis in large preclinical study cohorts.

"despite the enormous achievements of deep learning (dl) based models, their non-transparent nature led to restricted applicability and distrusted predictions. such predictions emerge from erroneous in-distribution (id) and out-of-distribution (ood) samples, which results in disastrous effects in the medical domain, specifically in medical image segmentation (mis). to mitigate such effects, several existing works accomplish ood sample detection; however, the trustworthiness issues from id samples still require thorough investigation. to this end, a novel method trustmis (trustworthy medical image segmentation) is proposed in this paper, which provides the trustworthiness and improved performance of id samples for dl-based mis models. trustmis works in three folds: it (investigating trustworthiness), int (improving non-trustworthy prediction) and cso (classifier switching operation). initially, the it method investigates the trustworthiness of mis by leveraging similar characteristics and consistency analysis of input and its variants. subsequently, the int method employs the it method to improve the performance of the mis model. it leverages the observation that an input providing erroneous segmentation can provide correct segmentation with rotated input. eventually, the cso method employs the int method to scrutinise several mis models and selects the model that delivers the most trustworthy prediction. the experiments conducted on publicly available datasets using well-known mis models reveal that trustmis has successfully provided a trustworthiness measure, outperformed the existing methods, and improved the performance of state-of-the-art mis models. our implementation is available at https://github.com/snehashukla937/ trustmis.& copy; 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0513
