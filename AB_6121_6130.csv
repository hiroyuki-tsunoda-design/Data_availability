"background: psychological well-being is important among individuals with myocardial infarction (mi) given the clear links between stress, depression, and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. stress and depressive disorders are more prevalent in women than men after mi. resilience may protect against stress and depressive disorders after a traumatic event. longitudinal data are lacking in populations post mi. we examined the role of resilience in the psychological recovery of women post mi, over time. methods and results: we analyzed a sample from a longitudinal observational multicenter study (united states, canada) of women post mi, between 2016 and 2020. perceived stress (perceived stress scale-4 [pss-4]) and depressive symptoms (patient health questionnaire-2 [phq-2]) were assessed at baseline (time of mi) and 2 months post mi. demographics, clinical characteristics, and resilience (brief resilience scale [brs]) were collected at baseline. low and normal/high resilience groups were established as per published cutoffs (brs scores < 3 or >= 3). mixed-effects modeling was used to examine associations between resilience and psychological recovery over 2 months. the sample included 449 women, mean (sd) age, 62.2 (13.2) years, of whom 61.1% identified as non-hispanic white, 18.5% as non-hispanic black, and 15.4% as hispanic/ latina. twenty-three percent had low resilience. the low resilience group had significantly higher pss-4 and phq-2 scores than the normal/high resilience group at all time points. in adjusted models, both groups showed a decrease in pss-4 scores over time. conclusions: in a diverse cohort of women post mi, higher resilience is associated with better psychological recovery over time. future work should focus on developing strategies to strengthen resilience and improve psychological well-being for women with mi. registration: url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct02905357; unique identifier: nct02905357.",AB_0613
"motivation: differential abundance analysis is an essential and commonly used tool to characterize the difference between microbial communities. however, identifying differentially abundant microbes remains a challenging problem because the observed microbiome data are inherently compositional, excessive sparse, and distorted by experimental bias. besides these major challenges, the results of differential abundance analysis also depend largely on the choice of analysis unit, adding another practical complexity to this already complicated problem.results: in this work, we introduce a new differential abundance test called the msrdb test, which embeds the sequences into a metric space and integrates a multiscale adaptive strategy for utilizing spatial structure to identify differentially abundant microbes. compared with existing methods, the msrdb test can detect differentially abundant microbes at the finest resolution offered by data and provide adequate detection power while being robust to zero counts, compositional effect, and experimental bias in the microbial compositional dataset. applications to both simulated and real microbial compositional datasets demonstrate the usefulness of the msrdb test.availability and implementation: all analyses can be found under https://github.com/lakerwsl/msrdb-manuscript-code.",AB_0613
"background: behavioral interventions for chronic pain among people with hiv (pwh) are understudied, with great potential to improve pain and function. chronic pain is an important comorbidity that affects between 30% and 85% of pwh and is associated with greater odds of functional impairment, increased emergency room utilization, suboptimal retention in hiv care, and failure to achieve virologic suppression. however, to date, there are few effective and scalable interventions for chronic pain in pwh.objective: this manuscript outlines the protocol for a randomized control trial of a novel theory-based pain self-management intervention, skills to manage pain (stomp), developed for and tailored to pwh versus enhanced usual care controls. stomp is a 12-week intervention developed from prior work on pain self-management in pwh and rigorous intervention mapping. the stomp intervention has three major compo-nents: group sessions, one-on-one pain self-management sessions, and peer leaders. methods: stomp is a 2-arm randomized trial conducted with pwh with chronic pain. the trial compares stomp, a theory-based intervention tailored to improving chronic pain in pwh, with a comparison group receiving enhanced usual care effectiveness on pain and hiv proximal outcome measures. the proposed sample size is 280 pwh recruited from two high-volume center for aids research network of integrated clinical systems clinical sites.results: study procedures are ongoing, and results will be recorded in future manuscripts.conclusion: the study will generate evidence on the effectiveness of stomp with the potential to dramatically change chronic pain treatment for pwh.trial registration: clinicialtrials.gov, clinical trials registration # nct03692611 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/s how/nct03692611?term=stomp&cond=hiv&draw=2&rank=1",AB_0613
"this paper proposes a new pipeline to perform early action detection from skeleton-based untrimmed videos. our pipeline includes two new technical components. the first is a new dynamic dilated convo-lutional network (ddcn), which supports dynamic temporal sampling and makes feature learning more robust against temporal scale variance in action sequences. the second is a new semantic referencing module, which uses identified objects in the scene and their co-existence relationship with actions to adjust the probabilities of inferred actions. such semantic guidance can help distinguish many ambigu-ous actions, which is a core challenge in the early detection of incomplete actions. our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance in early action detection in two widely used skeleton-based untrimmed video benchmarks. the source codes are available at: https://github.com/powercoder64/ddcn _ srm .(c) 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0613
"background: people with cancer experience symptoms that adversely affect quality of life. despite existing in-terventions and clinical guidelines, timely symptom management remains uneven in oncology care. we describe a study to implement and evaluate an electronic health record (ehr)-integrated symptom monitoring and management program in adult outpatient cancer care.methods: our cancer patient-reported outcomes (cpro) symptom monitoring and management program is a customized ehr-integrated installation. we will implement cpro across all northwestern memorial healthcare (nmhc) hematology/oncology clinics. we will conduct a cluster randomized modified stepped-wedge trial to evaluate patient and clinician engagement with cpro. further, we will embed a patient-level randomized clinical trial to evaluate the impact of an additional enhanced care (ec; cpro plus web-based symptom self-management intervention) relative to usual care (uc; cpro alone). the project uses a type 2 hybrid effectiveness -implementation approach. the intervention will be implemented across seven regional clusters within the healthcare system comprising 32 clinic sites. a 6-month prospective pre-implementation enrollment period will be followed by a post-implementation enrollment period, during which newly enrolled, consenting patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to ec or uc. we will follow patients for 12 months post-enrollment. patients ran-domized to ec will receive evidence-based symptom-management content on cancer-related concerns and ap-proaches to enhance quality of life, using a web-based tool (mynm care corner). this design allows for within -and between-site evaluation of implementation plus a group-based comparison to demonstrate effectiveness on patient-level outcomes.discussion: the project has potential to guide implementation of future healthcare system-level cancer symptom management programs.http://clinicaltrials.gov # nct03988543",AB_0613
"motivation: multispectral biological fluorescence microscopy has enabled the identification of multiple targets in complex samples. the accuracy in the unmixing result degrades (i) as the number of fluorophores used in any experiment increases and (ii) as the signal-to-noise ratio in the recorded images decreases. further, the availability of prior knowledge regarding the expected spatial distributions of fluorophores in images of labeled cells provides an opportunity to improve the accuracy of fluorophore identification and abundance.results: we propose a regularized sparse and low-rank poisson regression unmixing approach (sl-pru) to deconvolve spectral images labeled with highly overlapping fluorophores which are recorded in low signal-to-noise regimes. first, sl-pru implements multipenalty terms when pursuing sparseness and spatial correlation of the resulting abundances in small neighborhoods simultaneously. second, sl-pru makes use of poisson regression for unmixing instead of least squares regression to better estimate photon abundance. third, we propose a method to tune the sl-pru parameters involved in the unmixing procedure in the absence of knowledge of the ground truth abundance information in a recorded image. by validating on simulated and real-world images, we show that our proposed method leads to improved accuracy in unmixing fluorophores with highly overlapping spectra.availability and implementation: the source code used for this article was written in matlab and is available with the test data at https://github.com/wangruogu/sl-pru.",AB_0613

"objective the goal of this study was to compare the impact of using a lower thoracic (lt) versus upper lumbar (ul) level as the upper instrumented vertebra (uiv) on clinical and radiographic outcomes following minimally invasive surgery for adult spinal deformity. methods a multicenter retrospective study design was used. inclusion criteria were age >= 18 years, and one of the following: coronal cobb angle > 20 degrees, sagittal vertical axis > 50 mm, pelvic tilt > 20 degrees, pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis mismatch > 10 degrees. patients were treated with circumferential or hybrid minimally invasive techniques at >= 3 spinal levels and had a 2-year minimum follow-up. they were then divided into 2 groups depending on whether the uiv was in the ul region, defined as a uiv location of l1-2, or the lt region, defined as t10-12. results a total of 114 of 223 patients met the inclusion criteria (68 lt and 46 ul). the ul group was older (67.5 vs 62.3 years; p = 0.015). preoperative spinopelvic parameters were similar, except for sacral slope, which was higher in the ul group (30.5 degrees vs 26.5 degrees; p < 0.001). the percentage of patients with fixation crossing the lumbosacral junction was also similar (70.6% vs 67.4%; p = 0.717). postoperative lumbar lordosis (42.5 degrees vs 35.5 degrees; p = 0.01) and change in coronal cobb angle (-23.2 degrees vs -9.6 degrees; p < 0.001) were greater in the lt group, but other changes in postoperative spinopelvic parameters and changes in health-related quality-of-life scores were similar between groups. reoperation rates were lower in the ul group (17.4% vs 36.8%; p = 0.025), largely associated with fewer radiographic failures (ul = 10.9%vs lt = 26.5%; p = 0.042); however, overall complication rates were not significantly different (ul = 43.5% vs lt = 60.3%; p = 0.077). conclusions selecting a ul vertebra for uiv in minimally invasive surgical correction of adult spinal deformity results in lower reoperation rates compared to extending fixation to the lt region. this choice also correlates with shorter operating room times and reduced estimated blood loss. although extending fixation to the lt region is associated with slightly greater lumbar lordosis and a greater change in the coronal cobb angle, clinical outcomes were similar between the lt and ul groups for uiv. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2024.8.spine231335",AB_0613
"study objectives: to assess the association of insomnia symptoms and psychiatric symptoms in patients with spinal cord injury or disease (sci/d).methods: in this cross-sectional observational study, veterans with sci/d (n = 72; mean = 59.85 & plusmn; 10.4 years; 92% male) completed baseline measures, including the insomnia severity index (isi) during the baseline phase of a clinical trial on treatment of sleep disorders in veterans with sci/d. depression severity was measured by the patient health questionnaire (phq-9; sleep items excluded), anxiety severity was measured by the generalized anxiety disorder screener (gad-7), and probable posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) was measured by the primary care ptsd screener. blocked regression was used to evaluate the impact of insomnia symptoms (isi) on mental health measures after accounting for demographics and level of spinal cord injury/disease.results: on average, participants scored in the mild range for depression (phq-9 = 7.4 & plusmn; 5.9) and anxiety severity (gad-7 = 6.1 & plusmn; 6.1). in total, 36.1% (n = 26) screened positive for probable ptsd. isi explained 19% of the variance in phq-9 and 20% of the variance in gad-7 (p < .001) over and above demographics and sci/d level of injury/disease. odds of probable ptsd were increased 1.22-fold for each 1 unit increase in isi (p = .001) after accounting for demographics and level of injury/disease.conclusions: in veterans with sci/d, insomnia severity was linked to depression and anxiety symptom severity and risk of ptsd. study results warrant further research to evaluate the impact of insomnia treatment on depression, anxiety, and ptsd in patients with sci/d. clinical trial registration: registry: clinicaltrials.gov; name: treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with sci; url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/ show/nct02830074; identifier: nct02830074.keywords: spinal cord injury, spinal cord diseases, insomnia, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disordercitation: kelly mr, zeineddine s, mitchell mn, et al. insomnia severity predicts depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder in veterans with spinal cord injury or disease: a cross-sectional observational study. j clin sleep med. 2023;19(4):695-701.",AB_0613
"we combine the isothermal jeans model and the model of adiabatic halo contraction into a semi-analytic procedure for computing the density profile of self-interacting dark-matter (sidm) haloes with the gravitational influence from the inhabitant galaxies. the model agrees well with cosmological sidm simulations over the entire core-forming stage up to the onset of gravothermal core-collapse. using this model, we show that the halo response to baryons is more diverse in sidm than in cdm and depends sensitively on galaxy size, a desirable feature in the context of the structural diversity of bright dwarfs. the fast speed of the method facilitates analyses that would be challenging for numerical simulations - notably, we quantify the sidm halo response as functions of the baryonic properties, on a fine mesh grid spanned by the baryon-to-total-mass ratio, m-b/m-vir, and galaxy compactness, r(1/2) /r-vir; we show with high statistical precision that for typical milky-way-like systems, the sidm profiles are similar to their cdm counterparts; and we delineate the regime of core-collapse in the m-b/m-vir - r(1/2)/r-vir space, for a given cross section and concentration. finally, we compare the isothermal jeans model with the more sophisticated gravothermal fluid model, and show that the former yields faster core formation and agrees better with cosmological simulations. we attribute the difference to whether the target cdm halo is used as a boundary condition or as the initial condition for the gravothermal evolution, and thus comment on possible improvements of the fluid model. we have made our model publicly available at https://github.com/jiangfangzhou/sidm",AB_0613
