"remote sensing satellites capture the cyclic dynamics of our planet in regular time intervals recorded in satellite time series data. end-to-end trained deep learning models use this time series data to make predictions at a large scale, for instance, to produce up-to-date crop cover maps. most time series classification approaches focus on the accuracy of predictions. however, the earliness of the prediction is also of great importance since coming to an early decision can make a crucial difference in time-sensitive applications. in this work, we present an end-to-end learned early classification of time series (elects) model that estimates a classification score and a probability of whether sufficient data has been observed to come to an early and still accurate decision. elects is modular: any deep time series classification model can adopt the elects conceptual idea by adding a second prediction head that outputs a probability of stopping the classification. the elects loss function then optimizes the overall model on a balanced objective of earliness and accuracy. our experiments on four crop classification datasets from europe and africa show that elects allows reaching state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing the quantity of data massively to be downloaded, stored, and processed. the source code is available at https://github.com/marccoru/elects.",AB_0472
"the reversible lipid modification protein s-palmitoylation can dynamically modify the localization, diffusion, function, conformation and physical interactions of substrate proteins. dysregulated s-palmitoylation is associated with a multitude of human diseases including brain and metabolic disorders, viral infection and cancer. however, the diverse expression patterns of the genes that regulate palmitoylation in the broad range of human cell types are currently unexplored, and their expression in commonly used cell lines that are the workhorse of basic and preclinical research are often overlooked when studying palmitoylation dependent processes. we therefore created cellpalmseq (https://cellpalmseq.med.ubc.ca), a curated rnaseq database and interactive webtool for visualization of the expression patterns of the genes that regulate palmitoylation across human single cell types, bulk tissue, cancer cell lines and commonly used laboratory non-human cell lines. this resource will allow exploration of these expression patterns, revealing important insights into cellular physiology and disease, and will aid with cell line selection and the interpretation of results when studying important cellular processes that depend on protein s-palmitoylation.",AB_0472
"sljcompact is a matlab based program that computes the band diagram and current-voltage characteristics of semiconductor photoanodes. to enable rapid insights, corresponding to various semiconductorliquid junction (slj) properties and observable current-voltage characteristics, an abridged set of semianalytical conservation equations are employed in the semiconductor region coupled with gouy-chapman screening within the liquid region. electrostatic interactions between these regions across the junction are solved self-consistently through a variation on the scharfetter-gummel method. in this manner, the model is able to provide key band diagram insights regarding the correlated operation of photoanodes, both under illumination and in the dark, with respect to: current-voltage trends, quasi-fermi level splitting, hole transfer rates, electron transfer rates, depletion region screening, hole inversion screening, and carrier recombination lifetimes. motivated by kroemer's lemma, sljcompact is intended to further the adoption of band diagram methods within the photoelectrochemical device literature, by providing a computationally inexpensive approach residing between computationally intensive full continuity equation solvers and more approximate analytical expressions. program summary program title: sljcompact cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /by4ddckrpt.1 developer's repository link: https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/similar to bevankh /codes /sljcompact/ licensing provisions: cc by nc 4.0 programming language: matlab nature of problem: providing rapid self-consistently computed insights into the operational and band diagram characteristics of photoelectrochemical devices. solution method: a semi-analytical approach for solving carrier transfer and recombination in the depletion region coupled self-consistently with poisson's equation across a semiconductor-liquid junction, solved together through a variation on the scharfetter-gummel method. additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: the current version is only applicable to photoanodes and forward bias trends at/beyond flat band conditions.

"motivation: nowadays, epigenetic gene regulations are studied in each part of the biology, from embryonic development to diseases such as cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. currently, to quantify and compare cpg methylation levels of a specific region of interest, the most accessible technique is the bisulfite sequencing pcr (bsp). however, no existing user-friendly tool is able to analyze data from all approaches of bsp. therefore, the most convenient way to process results from the direct sequencing of pcr products (direct-bsp) is to manually analyze the chromatogram traces, which is a repetitive and prone to error task. results: here, we implement a new r-based tool, called absp for analysis of bisulfite sequencing pcr, providing a complete analytic process of both direct-bsp and cloning-bsp data. it uses the raw sequencing trace files (.ab1) as input to compute and compare cpg methylation percentages. it is fully automated and includes a user-friendly interface as a built-in r shiny app, quality control steps and generates publication-ready graphics. availability and implementation: the absp tool and associated data are available on github at https://github.com/absp-methylation-tool/absp. contact: chann.lagadec@inserm.fr supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0472
"micrornas (mirnas) are small non-coding ribonucleic acids that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression through the targeting of messenger rna (mrnas). most mirna target predictors have focused on animal species and prediction performance drops substantially when applied to plant species. several rule-based mirna target predictors have been developed in plant species, but they often fail to discover new mirna targets with non-canonical mirna-mrna binding. here, the recently published tardb database of plant mirna-mrna data is leveraged to retrain the tarpmir mirna target predictor for application on plant species. rigorous experiment design across four plant test species demonstrates that animal-trained predictors fail to sustain performance on plant species, and that the use of plant-specific training data improves accuracy depending on the quantity of plant training data used. surprisingly, our results indicate that the complete exclusion of animal training data leads to the most accurate plant-specific mirna target predictor indicating that animal-based data may detract from mirna target prediction in plants. our final plant-specific mirna prediction method, dubbed p-tarpmir, is freely available for use at http://ptarpmir.cu-bic.ca. the final p-tarpmir method is used to predict targets for all mirna within the soybean genome. those ranked predictions, together with go term enrichment, are shared with the research community.",AB_0472
"the accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities is a fundamental problem for the rational design of new drug entities. current computational approaches are either too expensive or inaccurate to be effectively used in virtual high-throughput screening campaigns. in addition, the most sophisticated methods, e.g., those based on configurational sampling by molecular dynamics, require significant pre-and postprocessing to provide a final ranking, which hinders straightforward applications by nonexpert users. we present a novel computational platform named chemflow to bridge the gap between 2d chemical libraries and estimated protein-ligand binding affinities. the software is designed to prepare a library of compounds provided in smiles or sdf format, dock them into the protein binding site, and rescore the poses by simplified free energy calculations. using a data set of 626 protein-ligand complexes and gpu computing, we demonstrate that chemflow provides relative binding free energies with an rmse < 2 kcal/mol at a rate of 1000 ligands per day on a midsize computer cluster. the software is publicly available at https:// github.com/ifmlab/chemflow.",AB_0472
"purpose root system architectures are complex and challenging to characterize effectively for agronomic and ecological discovery. methods we propose a new method, spatial and texture analysis of root system distribution with earth mover's distance (starseed), for comparing root system distributions that incorporates spatial information through a novel application of the earth mover's distance (emd). results we illustrate that the approach captures the response of sesame root systems for different genotypes and soil moisture levels. starseed provides quantitative and visual insights into changes that occur in root architectures across experimental treatments. conclusion starseed can be generalized to other plants and provides insight into root system architecture development and response to varying growth conditions not captured by existing root architecture metrics and models. the code and data for our experiments are publicly available: https://github.com/gatorsense/starseed.",AB_0472
"the rapid growth of electric vehicle (ev) charging will present challenges to electrical distribution networks and will affect grid operation and reliability. in order to improve the understanding of ev charging behaviour, we present the open access ev charging profiles and waveforms (ev-cpw) dataset for ac charging. the dataset comprises of charging profiles and high-resolution current/voltage ac waveforms for 12 different ev's, including popular battery ev's and plug-in hybrid ev's. a power quality analysis is carried out to compare the ev charging behaviours to new standards recommendations proposed by standards agencies. this includes evaluating power factor, current and voltage distortion, harmonic content and load behaviour in relation to grid voltage and frequency. the preliminary data analysis presented reveals that each ev has distinctive charging characteristics and the power quality analysis indicates variation in the on-board charger circuits employed by the ev's. the ev-cpw dataset can be used for many more applications and studies, including ev charging infrastructure planning, demand management, ev charging coupled with renewable energy studies, power quality analysis, equipment lifetime studies and power electronics design. the dataset can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.7910/dvn/f81cxw.",AB_0472
"we introduce tree-amp, standing for tree approximate message passing, a python package for compositional inference in high-dimensional tree-structured models. the package provides a unifying framework to study several approximate message passing algorithms previously derived for a variety of machine learning tasks such as generalized linear models, inference in multi-layer networks, matrix factorization, and reconstruction using non separable penalties. for some models, the asymptotic performance of the algorithm can be theoretically predicted by the state evolution, and the measurements entropy estimated by the free entropy formalism. the implementation is modular by design: each module, which implements a factor, can be composed at will with other modules to solve complex inference tasks. the user only needs to declare the factor graph of the model: the inference algorithm, state evolution and entropy estimation are fully automated. the source code is publicly available at https://github.com/sphinxteam/tramp and the documentation at",AB_0472
