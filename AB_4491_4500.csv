"background: critically ill patients must be monitored constantly in intensive care units (icus). among many laboratory variables, nutritional status indicators are a key role in the prognosis of diseases. we investigated the effects of l-carnitine adjunctive therapy on monitoring variables in critical illness.method: a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial was implemented in a medical icu. participants were 54 patients, aged > 18 years, with multiple conditions, randomly assigned to receive 3 g l-carnitine per day or placebo, along with enteral feeding, for 1 week. primary outcomes included monitoring variables related to nutritional status.result: of 54 patients randomly assigned, 51 completed the trial. serum albumin (alb) (p -value: 0.001), total protein (p-value: 0.003), and calcium (ca) (0.044) significantly increased in the intervention vs. control group. alanine transaminase (alt) (0.022), lactate (< 0.001), creatinine (cr) (0.005), and international normalized ratio (inr) (0.049) decreased meaningfully in the intervention vs. control group.conclusion: l-carnitine supplementation in critically ill patients can improve several parameters including inr, cr, alt, lactate, ca, alb, and total protein. trial registration: iranian registry of clinical trials irct 20151108024938n2. this trial was approved by the research ethics committee of mashhad university of medical sciences (registration code: ir.mums.fm.rec.1396.671) (available at https://en.irct.ir/trial/30748, may 2018).",AB_0450
"video frame interpolation (vfi) is a fundamental research topic in video processing, which is currently attracting increased attention across the research community. while the development of more advanced vfi algorithms has been extensively researched, there remains little understanding of how humans perceive the quality of interpolated content and how well existing objective quality assessment methods perform when measuring the perceived quality. in order to narrow this research gap, we have developed a new video quality database named bvi-vfi, which contains 540 distorted sequences generated by applying five commonly used vfi algorithms to 36 diverse source videos with various spatial resolutions and frame rates. we collected more than 10,800 quality ratings for these videos through a large scale subjective study involving 189 human subjects. based on the collected subjective scores, we further analysed the influence of vfi algorithms and frame rates on the perceptual quality of interpolated videos. moreover, we benchmarked the performance of 33 classic and state-of-the-art objective image/video quality metrics on the new database, and demonstrated the urgent requirement for more accurate bespoke quality assessment methods for vfi. to facilitate further research in this area, we have made bvi-vfi publicly available at https://github.com/danier97/bvi-vfi-database.",AB_0450
"regularized regression models are well studied and, under appropriate conditions, offer fast and statistically interpretable results. however, large data in many applications are heterogeneous in the sense of harboring distributional differences between latent groups. then, the assumption that the conditional distribution of response y given features x is the same for all samples may not hold. furthermore, in scientific applications, the covariance structure of the features may contain important signals and its learning is also affected by latent group structure. we propose a class of mixture models for paired data px, y q that couples together the distribution of x (using sparse graphical models) and the conditional y | x (using sparse regression models). the regression and graphical models are specific to the latent groups and model parameters are estimated jointly. this allows signals in either or both of the feature distribution and regression model to inform learning of latent structure and provides automatic control of confounding by such structure. estimation is handled via an expectation-maximization algorithm, whose convergence is established theoretically. we illustrate the key ideas via empirical examples. an r package is available at https://github.com/k-perrakis/regjmix.",AB_0450
"we consider the problem of fitting autoregressive graph generative models via maximum likelihood estimation (mle). mle is intractable for graph autoregressive models because the nodes in a graph can be arbitrarily reordered; thus the exact likelihood involves a sum over all possible node orders leading to the same graph. in this work, we fit the graph models by maximizing a variational bound, which is built by first deriving the joint probability over the graph and the node order of the autoregressive process. this approach avoids the need to specify ad-hoc node orders, since an inference network learns the most likely node sequences that have generated a given graph. we improve the approach by developing a graph generative model based on attention mechanisms and an inference network based on routing search. we demonstrate empirically that fitting autoregressive graph models via variational inference improves their qualitative and quantitative performance, and the improved model and inference network further boost the performance. the implementation of the proposed model is publicly available at https://github.com/tufts-ml/graph-generation-mle.",AB_0450
"the taxonomy of cretaceous cirripedes referred to the sessile orders brachylepadomorpha and verrucomorpha is revised. new taxa include the brachylepadid genera crithmumlepas (type species c. hoensis sp. nov., c. aycliffensis sp. nov.) and calvatilepas (type species c. recurvus sp. nov.). the family pycnolepadidae nov. is established (constituent genera pycnolepas, faxelepas) and pycnolepas batchelorum sp. nov. is described; a new eoverrucid species, e. barringtonensis sp. nov. is erected. cladistic analysis of 48 characters of 18 operational taxonomic units, including 16 in-group sessile taxa yielded a consensus tree showing the strongly supported monophyly of brachylepadomorpha + verrucomorpha + balanomorpha. it is recommended that the order brachylepadomorpha is abandoned, and its constituent families are identified as, respectively, stem group verrucomorpha (pycnolepadidae) and stem group balanomorpha (brachylepadidae). the sister-group relationship of verrucomorpha and balanomorpha, identified from many molecular studies, is confirmed from shell morphological data. the neolepadoidea are shown to closely parallel the sessile adaptations of verrucomorphs and balanomorphs. the fossil record of key segments of cirripede evolution is demonstrated to be remarkably, and surprisingly, complete.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:8f450f22-94ba-49d3-baf9-a8377359d0e8",AB_0450
"the long-tailed distribution is a common phenomenon in the real world. extracted large scale image datasets inevitably demonstrate the long-tailed property and models trained with imbalanced data can obtain high performance for the over-represented categories, but struggle for the under-represented categories, leading to biased predictions and performance degradation. to address this challenge, we propose a novel de-biasing method named inverse image frequency (iif). iif is a multiplicative margin adjustment transformation of the logits in the classification layer of a convolutional neural network. our method achieves stronger performance than similar works and it is especially useful for downstream tasks such as long-tailed instance segmentation as it produces fewer false positive detections. our extensive experiments show that iif surpasses the state of the art on many long-tailed benchmarks such as imagenet-lt, cifar-lt, places-lt and lvis, reaching 55.8% top-1 accuracy with resnet50 on imagenet-lt and 26.3% segmentation ap with maskrcnn resnet50 on lvis. code available at https://github.com/kostas1515/iif",AB_0450
"the subject of autonomy within unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) has proven to be a remarkable research field - mostly due to the development of ai techniques within embedded advanced bespoke microcontrollers - during the last several decades. for drones, as safety-critical systems, there is an increasing need for onboard detect & avoid (daa) technology i) to see, sense or detect conflicting traffic or imminent non-cooperative threats due to their high mobility with multiple degrees of freedom and the complexity of deployed unstructured environments, and subsequently ii) to take the appropriate actions to avoid collisions depending upon the level of autonomy. the safe and efficient integration of uav traffic management (utm) systems with air traffic management (atm) systems, using intelligent autonomous approaches, is an emerging requirement where the number of diverse uav applications is increasing on a large scale in dense air traffic environments for completing swarms of multiple complex missions flexibly and simultaneously. significant progress over the past few years has been made in detecting uavs present in aerospace, identifying them, and determining their existing flight path. this study makes greater use of electronic conspicuity (ec) information made available by pilotaware ltd (https://www.pilotaware.com) in developing an advanced collision management methodology - drone aware collision management (dacm) - capable of determining and executing a variety of time-optimal evasive collision avoidance (ca) manoeuvres using a reactive geometric conflict detection and resolution (cdr) technique. the merits of the dacm methodology have been demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world field tests in avoiding mid-air collisions (mac) between uavs and manned aeroplanes. the results show that the proposed methodology can be employed successfully in avoiding collisions while limiting the deviation from the original trajectory in highly dynamic aerospace without requiring sophisticated sensors and prior training. with the proposed technological improvement equipped with artificial intelligence (ai) techniques, mac risks which cannot be avoided with the current off-the-shelf sensor technologies, in particular, between flights with very high velocities, can be definitely prevented with the accurate measurements and state and situation awareness (ssa) that uses a global coverage strategy with real-time low latency ec data feeds acquired from all aircraft. the mac standards, dictated by the aviation authorities, can be mandated for uavs considering the reliable decision-making abilities of dacm - without creating new collision risks during evasive manoeuvres, which can expedite the safe and efficient integration of uavs into atm systems.",AB_0450
"machine learning-based methodologies have recently been adapted to solve control problems. the neural lyapunov control (nlc) method is one such example. this approach combines artificial neural networks (anns) with satisfiability modulo theories (smt) solvers to synthesise stabilising control laws and to prove their formal correctness. the anns are trained over a dataset of state-space samples to generate candidate control and lyapunov functions, while the smt solvers are tasked with certifying the correctness of the lyapunov function over a continuous domain or by returning a counterexample. despite the approach's attractiveness, issues can occur due to subsequent calls of the smt module at times returning similar counterexamples, which can turn out to be uninformative and may lead to dataset overfitting. additionally, the control network weights are usually initialised with pre-computed gains from state-feedback controllers, e.g. linear-quadratic regulators. to properly perform the initialisation requires user time and control expertise. in this work, we present an augmented nlc method that mitigates these drawbacks, removes the need for the control initialisation and further improves counterexample generation. as a result, the proposed method allows the synthesis of nonlinear (as well as linear) control laws with the sole requirement being the knowledge of the system dynamics. the anlc is tested over challenging benchmarks such as the lorenz attractor and outperformed existing methods in terms of successful synthesis rate. the developed framework is released open-source at: https://github.com/grande-dev/augmented-neural-lyapunov-control.",AB_0450
"background: with many digital mental health interventions failing to engage clients for enough time to demonstrate substantive changes to their well-being and with only 2% of all digital solutions on app stores having undergone randomized controlled trials, the rising demand for mental health prevention and early intervention care is not being met. young adults in particular struggle to find digital well-being apps that suit their needs.objective: this study explored the effects of equoo, an evidence-based mental health game that teaches psychological skills through gamification, on resilience, depression, anxiety, and attrition in a student population. methods: in total, 1165 students from 180 universities in the united kingdom participated in a 5-week, 3-armed randomized controlled trial. participants were randomly allocated into 1 of 3 groups: equoo users, users of a treatment-as-usual evidence-based cognitive behavioral health app called sanvello, and a no-intervention waitlist. the rugged resilience scale, generalized anxiety disorder-7, and patient health questionnaire-8 were administered to all participants at baseline and every 7 days until completion.results: a repeated measures-anova revealed statistically significant increases in resilience scores in the test group (p<.001) compared with both control groups (sanvello: p=.10 and waitlist: p=.82) over 5 weeks. the app also significantly decreased anxiety and depression scores (both p<.001). with 64.5% (251/389) adherence, the equoo group retained 42% more participants than the control groups.conclusions: digital health interventions such as equoo are effective, scalable, and low-cost solutions for supporting young adults and are available on all leading mobile platforms. further investigation could clarify the extent to which specific elements of the equoo app (including gamification) led to better outcomes.trial registration: german clinical trials register (drks) drks00027638; https://drks.de/search/en/trial/drks00027638",AB_0450
