"long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) play vital regulatory roles in many human complex diseases, however, the number of validated lncrna-disease associations is notable rare so far. how to predict potential lncrna-disease associations precisely through computational methods remains challenging. in this study, we proposed a novel method, ldvchn (lncrna-disease vector calculation heterogeneous networks), and also developed the corresponding model, heganlda (heterogeneous embedding generative adversarial networks lncrna-disease association), for predicting potential lncrna-disease associations. in heganlda, the graph embedding algorithm (hegan) was introduced for mapping all nodes in the lncrna-mirna-disease heterogeneous network into the low-dimensional vectors which severed as the inputs of ldvchn. heganlda effectively adopted the xgboost (extreme gradient boosting) classifier, which was trained by the low-dimensional vectors, to predict potential lncrna-disease associations. the 10-fold cross-validation method was utilized to evaluate the performance of our model, our model finally achieved an area under the roc curve of 0.983. according to the experiment results, heganlda outperformed any one of five current state-of-the-art methods. to further evaluate the effectiveness of heganlda in predicting potential lncrna-disease associations, both case studies and robustness tests were performed and the results confirmed its effectiveness and robustness. the source code and data of heganlda are available at https://github.com/heganlda/heganlda.",AB_0208
"background: despite advancements in treating right-sided colon cancer patients, the ideal scope of lymphadenectomy remains controversial. objective: our objective was to investigate the likelihood of d3 lymph node metastasis in right-sided colon cancer patients and develop a clinicopathological feature-based nomogram for d3 lymphadenectomy. design: we retrospectively analyzed 286 right-sided colon cancer patients who underwent d3 lymphadenectomy. the patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether d3 lymph node metastasis was positive. then, univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to obtain independent risk factors for predicting d3 lymph node metastasis. moreover, we performed receiver operating characteristic curve analyses to evaluate the predictive power of the model. setting: this study was conducted at nanfang hospital of southern medical university in china. patients: a total of 286 consecutive patients who underwent right hemicolectomy and d3 lymphadenectomy as a primary treatment for right-sided colon cancer between january 2016 and december 2019 were enrolled in this study. main outcome measures: the primary measures were independent risk factors for predicting d3 lymph node metastasis in right-sided colon cancer. results: the d3 lymph node metastasis rate in right-sided colon cancer patients was 16.1% (46/286). d3 lymphadenectasis on ct, lymphatic invasion, and t4 tumors were filtered out as independent risk factors for d3 lymph node metastasis according to the multivariable logistic regression analysis. we established a nomogram that predicted d3 lymph node metastasis of right-sided colon cancer on the combination of the 3 factors with an area under the curve of 0.717 (95% ci, 0.629-0.806). limitations: this was a retrospective study from a single center. conclusions: we developed a valuable clinicopathological feature-based nomogram to predict the incidence of d3 lymph node metastasis in right-sided colon cancer patients. patients with d3 lymphadenectasis on ct, preoperative t4 tumors, and lymphatic invasion should undergo d3 lymphadenectomy. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b852.",AB_0208
"counting the number of people in public places has received much attention, and researchers have devoted much effort to the task. however, the existing crowd counting approaches are mainly trained and tested in similar scenarios. the performance of crowd counting approaches degrades sharply when the test scenarios of the models are of different types from its training scenes. in practice, the crowd scenes are highly variable, and the lack of cross-scene capability could seriously limit the application of the existing approaches. we attribute the improvement in cross-scene crowd counting capability to the necessity of accommodating large changes in the scale of individuals and the ability to suppress the interference of cluttered backgrounds. to this end, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion network (mffnet) with cascaded supervision. the multi-scale features extracted from the crowd images are upsampled and then combined into several feature blocks, followed by convolution and deconvolution operations on the feature blocks to derive feature matrices of different resolutions. the feature matrices are fused from bottom to top. in the process of feature fusion, the crowd density maps corresponding to the feature matrices of different resolutions are predicted separately. we devise cascaded supervision to synchronously optimize the network of different resolution density map prediction during training. the cross-scene crowd counting experiments are conducted on four types of scenes: shanghaitech part_a (sht a) with high-density crowd scenes and small-scale individuals, shanghaitech part_b (sht b) with sparse crowd distribution and medium-scale individuals, ucf_cc_50 dataset with extremely dense scenes and tiny scale individuals, and ucf-qnrf dataset with extreme variations. mffnet exhibits the strongest scene adaptability relative to the state-of-the-art approaches, with an average decrease of 17.1% and 8.4% in mean absolute error (mae) and mean square error (mse), respectively. the contributions of different components in our method are verified in the ablation study using the devised evaluation metrics. our implementation will be available at https://github.com/learnsharing/mffnet.",AB_0208
"tumor-associated autoantibodies (taabs) have demonstrated potential as biomarkers for cancer detection. however, the understanding of their role in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) remains limited. in this study, we aimed to systematically collect and standardize information about these taabs and establish a comprehensive database as a platform for in-depth research. a total of 170 taabs were identified from published papers retrieved from pubmed, web of science, and embase. following normative reannotation, these taabs were referred to as 162 official symbols. the hcctaab (tumor-associated autoantibodies in hepatocellular carcinoma) atlas was developed using the r shiny framework and incorporating literature-based and multiomics data sets. this comprehensive online resource provides key information such as sensitivity, specificity, and additional details such as official symbols, official full names, uniprot, ncbi, hpa, nextprot, and aliases through hyperlinks. additionally, hcctaab offers six analytical modules for visualizing expression profiles, survival analysis, immune infiltration, similarity analysis, dna methylation, and dna mutation analysis. overall, the hcctaab atlas provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying taab and has the potential to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of hcc using autoantibodies. the hcctaab atlas is freely accessible at https://nscc.v.zzu.edu.cn/hcctaab/.",AB_0208
"accurate and comprehensive peptide precursor ions are crucial to tandem mass-spectrometry-based peptide identification. an identification engine can derive great advantages from the search space reduction enabled by credible and detailed precursors. furthermore, by considering multiple precursors per spectrum, both the number of identifications and the spectrum explainability can be substantially improved. here, we introduce peppre, which detects precursors by decomposing peaks into multiple isotope clusters using linear programming methods. the detected precursors are scored and ranked, and the high-scoring ones are used for subsequent peptide identification. peppre is evaluated both on regular and cross-linked peptide data sets and compared with 11 methods. the experimental results show that peppre achieves a remarkable increase of 203% in psm and 68% in peptide identifications compared to instrument software for regular peptides and 99% in psm and 27% in peptide pair identifications for cross-linked peptides, surpassing the performance of all other evaluated methods. in addition to the increased identification numbers, further credibility evaluations evidence the reliability of the identified results. moreover, by widening the isolation window of data acquisition from 2 to 8 th, with peppre, an engine is able to identify at least 64% more psms, thereby demonstrating the potential advantages of wide-window data acquisition. peppre is open-source and available at http://peppre.ctarn.io.",AB_0208
"motivation cancer is a complex disease that results in a significant number of global fatalities. treatment strategies can vary among patients, even if they have the same type of cancer. the application of precision medicine in cancer shows promise for treating different types of cancer, reducing healthcare expenses, and improving recovery rates. to achieve personalized cancer treatment, machine learning models have been developed to predict drug responses based on tumor and drug characteristics. however, current studies either focus on constructing homogeneous networks from single data source or heterogeneous networks from multiomics data. while multiomics data have shown potential in predicting drug responses in cancer cell lines, there is still a lack of research that effectively utilizes insights from different modalities. furthermore, effectively utilizing the multimodal knowledge of cancer cell lines poses a challenge due to the heterogeneity inherent in these modalities.results to address these challenges, we introduce mmcl-cdr (multimodal contrastive learning for cancer drug responses), a multimodal approach for cancer drug response prediction that integrates copy number variation, gene expression, morphology images of cell lines, and chemical structure of drugs. the objective of mmcl-cdr is to align cancer cell lines across different data modalities by learning cell line representations from omic and image data, and combined with structural drug representations to enhance the prediction of cancer drug responses (cdr). we have carried out comprehensive experiments and show that our model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in cdr prediction. the experimental results also prove that the model can learn more accurate cell line representation by integrating multiomics and morphological data from cell lines, thereby improving the accuracy of cdr prediction. in addition, the ablation study and qualitative analysis also confirm the effectiveness of each part of our proposed model. last but not least, mmcl-cdr opens up a new dimension for cancer drug response prediction through multimodal contrastive learning, pioneering a novel approach that integrates multiomics and multimodal drug and cell line modeling.availability and implementation mmcl-cdr is available at https://github.com/catly/mmcl-cdr.",AB_0208
"in vivo revealing how brain subregions are structurally connected during neonatal period via diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dmri) is critical for understanding brain development and pediatric mental disorders. however, even if preprocess was performed on dmri images including denoising, eddy and motion correction, and unring, residual artifacts still affect the construction of brain structural networks. in this study, nonlocal estimation of multispectral magnitudes (nesma) was extended to further smooth the preprocessed brain dmri images of 46 healthy infants from the developing human connectome project (dhcp). the proposed method smoothed dmri images by exploiting similar multispectral diffusion-weighted signal pattern and the signal redundance among 3d patches. after structural connectivity networks were constructed from the smoothed dmri images, network-level and nodal topological measures were estimated. while characteristic path length remained unchanged, significantly higher global efficiency, average clustering coefficient, and transitivity were observed in the infant structural networks built from nesma-smoothed dmri images. additionally, more brain subregions with clustering coefficient > = 0.035 and local efficiency > = 0.05 were identified. in summary, higher efficiency was observed in the structural connectivity networks of healthy infants. nonlocal estimation of multispectral diffusion-weighted volumes has nonnegligible effect on topological analysis of infant brain structural networks. the code for this algorithm is publicly available at https://github.com/freedom1979/nesma-dmri.",AB_0208

"motivation there is mounting evidence that the subcellular localization of lncrnas can provide valuable insights into their biological functions. in the real world of transcriptomes, lncrnas are usually localized in multiple subcellular localizations. furthermore, lncrnas have specific localization patterns for different subcellular localizations. although several computational methods have been developed to predict the subcellular localization of lncrnas, few of them are designed for lncrnas that have multiple subcellular localizations, and none of them take motif specificity into consideration.results in this study, we proposed a novel deep learning model, called lnclocformer, which uses only lncrna sequences to predict multi-label lncrna subcellular localization. lnclocformer utilizes eight transformer blocks to model long-range dependencies within the lncrna sequence and shares information across the lncrna sequence. to exploit the relationship between different subcellular localizations and find distinct localization patterns for different subcellular localizations, lnclocformer employs a localization-specific attention mechanism. the results demonstrate that lnclocformer outperforms existing state-of-the-art predictors on the hold-out test set. furthermore, we conducted a motif analysis and found lnclocformer can capture known motifs. ablation studies confirmed the contribution of the localization-specific attention mechanism in improving the prediction performance.availability and implementation the lnclocformer web server is available at http://csuligroup.com:9000/lnclocformer. the source code can be obtained from https://github.com/csubiogroup/lnclocformer.",AB_0208
