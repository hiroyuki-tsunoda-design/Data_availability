"the closed loops or cycles in a brain network embeds higher order signal transmission paths, which provide fundamental insights into the functioning of the brain. in this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for systematic identification and modeling of cycles using persistent homology and the hodge laplacian. various statistical inference procedures on cycles are developed. we validate the our methods on simulations and apply to brain networks obtained through the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. the computer codes for the hodge laplacian are given in https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/hodge.",AB_0584
"magus is a recent multiple sequence alignment method that provides excellent accuracy on large challenging datasets. magus uses divide-and-conquer: it divides the sequences into disjoint sets, computes alignments on the disjoint sets, and then merges the alignments using a technique it calls the graph clustering method (gcm). to understand why magus is so accurate, we show that gcm is a good heuristic for the np-hard mwt-am problem (maximum weight trace, adapted to the alignment merging problem). our study, using both biological and simulated data, establishes that mwt-am scores correlate very well with alignment accuracy and presents improvements to gcm that are even better heuristics for mwt-am. this study suggests a new direction for large-scale msa estimation based on improved divide-and-conquer strategies, with the merging step based on optimizing mwt-am. magus and its enhanced versions are available at https://github.com/vlasmirnov/magus.",AB_0584
"rare diseases individually affect relatively few people, but as a group they impact considerable numbers of people. the rat genome database (https://rgd.mcw.edu) is a knowledgebase that offers resources for rare disease research. this includes disease definitions, genes, quantitative trail loci (qtls), genetic variants, annotations to published literature, links to external resources, and more. one im-portant resource is identifying relevant cell lines and rat strains that serve as models for disease research. diseases, genes, and strains have report pages with consolidated data, and links to analysis tools. utilizing these globally accessible resources for rare disease re-search, potentiating discovery of mechanisms and new treatments, can point researchers toward solutions to alleviate the suffering of those afflicted with these diseases.",AB_0584
"background: a crisis in vacancies for academic nurse leaders across north american has been recognized. their role has become increasingly multifaceted, facing rapidly changing responsibilities that must evolve with health care, higher education and leadership. purpose: this retrospective study was conducted to investigate relationships among relevant variables included in the coache faculty job satisfaction survey. methods: the sample included survey responses from academic nursing administrators (n = 174). analysis of variance and multiple linear regression modeling were utilized.discussion: clarity in the tenure process (f (6, 92) = 2.92, p = .001), collaboration (p =.000) as well as academic leadership decisions of the dean or division chair (p = .006), and work-life balance (p =.005) were found to be significant.conclusions: understanding the factors important to administrators will assist in innovative approaches to attract and retain qualified leaders.cite this article: emory, j., kippenbrock, t., (2023, march/april). a four-year analysis of us and canadian academic nurse administrators' job satisfaction and intent to stay. nurs outlook, 71(2), 101914. https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.outlook.2022.101914.",AB_0584
"there is a clear and growing need to be able record and track the contributions of individual registered nurses (rns) to patient care and patient care outcomes in the us and also understand the state of the nursing workforce. the national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine report, the future of nursing 2020-2030: charting a path to achieve health equity (2021), identified the need to track nurses' collective and individual contributions to patient care outcomes. this capability depends upon the adoption of a unique nurse identifier and its implementation within electronic health records. additionally, there is a need to understand the nature and characteristics of the overall nursing workforce including supply and demand, turnover, attrition, credentialing, and geographic areas of practice. this need for data to support workforce studies and planning is dependent upon comprehensive databases describing the nursing workforce, with unique nurse identification to support linkage across data sources. there are two existing national nurse identifiers- the national provider identifier and the national council of state boards of nursing identifier. this article provides an overview of these two national nurse identifiers; reviews three databases that are not nurse specific to understand lessons learned in the development of those databases; and discusses the ethical, legal, social, diversity, equity, and inclusion implications of a unique nurse identifier. cite this article: chan, g.k., cummins, m.r., taylor, c.s., rambur, b., auerbach, d.i., meadows-oliver, m., cooke, c., turek, e.a., & pittman, p.

"transforming raw ehr data into machine learning model-ready inputs requires considerable effort. one widely used ehr database is medical information mart for intensive care (mimic). prior work on mimic-iii cannot query the updated and improved mimic-iv version. besides, the need to use multicenter datasets further highlights the challenge of ehr data extraction. therefore, we developed an extraction pipeline that works on both mimic-iv and eicu collaborative research database and allows for model cross validation using these 2 databases. under the default choices, the pipeline extracted 38,766 and 126,448 icu records for mimic-iv and eicu, respectively. using the extracted time-dependent variables, we compared the area under the curve (auc) performance with prior works on clinically relevant tasks such as in-hospital mortality prediction. metre achieved comparable performance with auc 0.723-0.888 across all tasks with mimic-iv. additionally, when we evaluated the model directly on mimic-iv data using a model trained on eicu, we observed that the auc change can be as small as +0.019 or -0.015. our open-source pipeline transforms mimic-iv and eicu into structured data frames and allows researchers to perform model training and testing using data collected from different institutions, which is of critical importance for model deployment under clinical contexts. the code used to extract the data and perform training is available here: https://github.com/weiliao97/metre.",AB_0584
"as interest in using unsupervised deep learning models to analyze gene expression data has grown, an increasing number of methods have been developed to make these models more interpretable. these methods can be separated into two groups: post hoc analyses of black box models through feature attribution methods and approaches to build inherently interpretable models through biologically-constrained architectures. we argue that these approaches are not mutually exclusive, but can in fact be usefully combined. we propose pause (https://github.com/suinleelab/pause), an unsupervised pathway attribution method that identifies major sources of transcrip-tomic variation when combined with biologically-constrained neural network models.",AB_0584
"small extracellular vesicles (sevs) and their rna cargo in milk are bioavailable in humans, pigs, and mice, and their dietary depletion and supplementation elicits phenotypes. little is known about the content and biological activity of sevs in foods of animal origin other than milk. here we tested the hypothesis that sevs in chicken eggs (gallus gallus) facilitate the transfer of rna cargo from an avian species to humans and mice, and their dietary depletion elicits phenotypes. sevs were purified from raw egg yolk by ultracentrifugation and authenticated by transmission electron microscopy, nano-tracking device, and immunoblots. the mirna profile was assessed by rna-sequencing. bioavailability of these mirnas in humans was assessed by egg feeding study in adults, and by culturing human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) with fluorophore-labeled egg sevs ex vivo. to further assess bioavailability, fluorophore-labeled mirnas, encapsulated in egg sevs, were administered to c57bl/6j mice by oral gavage. phenotypes of sev rna cargo depletion were assessed by feeding egg sev and rna-defined diets to mice and using spatial learning and memory in the barnes and water mazes as experimental readouts. egg yolk contained 6.30x10(10)+/- 6.06x10(9) sevs/ ml, which harbored eighty-three distinct mirnas. human pbmcs internalized sevs and their rna cargo. egg sevs, loaded with fluorophore-labeled rna and administered orally to mice, accumulated primarily in brain, intestine and lungs. spatial learning and memory (slm) was compromised in mice fed on egg sevand rna-depleted diet compared to controls. egg consumption elicited an increase of mirnas in human plasma. we conclude that egg sevs and their rna cargo probably are bioavailable. the human study is registered as a clinical trial and accessible at https://www.isrctn.com/isrctn77867213.",AB_0584
"background: reflection spectroscopy, utilized by the veggie meter, is a less-expensive, noninvasive method to quantify skin carotenoids and is a valid approximation of fruit and vegetable (fv) intake. however, it is unknown to what degree veggie meter-assessed skin carotenoid score change is responsive to changes in carotenoid intake. objectives: this study aimed to evaluate veggie meter-assessed skin carotenoid score response in a 6-wk randomized controlled trial of a carotenoid-containing juice to determine whether the veggie meter can be used to detect nutritionally relevant changes in carotenoid intake; and to compare skin and plasma carotenoid responses with the 6-wk trial. methods: in this 6-wk trial, participants (n = 162) who self-identified as one of 4 us racial/ethnic groups (25% black, 25% asian, 27% non -hispanic white, 23% hispanic) were randomized to a control group, receiving negligible carotenoids (177 ml apple juice/d), moderate -dose group, receiving 4 mg total carotenoids/d (177 ml orange-carrot juice/d), or high-dose group, receiving 8 mg total carotenoids/ d (355 ml orange-carrot juice/d). skin carotenoid score and plasma total carotenoid concentrations (alpha-carotene, 8-carotene, 8-cryptox-anthin, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin) were assessed at baseline, 3 wk, and 6 wk (n = 158 completed the trial). repeated measures linear models were used to examine skin and plasma carotenoids over time and between groups. results: at 6 wk, participants in the high-dose and moderate-dose groups had significantly higher mean skin carotenoid scores [414.0 (sd = 100.6) and 369.7 (sd =100.3), respectively] compared with those in the control group [305.2 (100.5)]. in the high-dose group, there was a 42% change in skin carotenoids from baseline (mean = 290.4) to a 6-wk follow-up (increase of 123, 123/290 = 42.4%). there was a 61% change in the plasma carotenoids in the high-dose group. conclusions: the veggie meter is sensitive to increases in daily carotenoid intake in diverse racial/ethnic groups over 6 wk. clinical trials registry number: this trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as id: nct04056624. study url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/c t2/show/nct04056624",AB_0584
