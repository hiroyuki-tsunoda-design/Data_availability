"complex deep convolutional networks are typically designed to achieve state-of-the-art results. such networks require powerful computing resources and cannot work efficiently on resource-constrained devices particularly for real-time use. to address these challenges, this study introduces resource-efficient lightweight approaches for segmentation, localization, super-resolution, and classification tasks. on this basis, we propose two novel lightweight architectures named: lite-unet and lite-srgan. we validated the effectiveness of our proposed networks using the large publicly available plant village dataset. lite-unet network is used for performing segmentation and localization tasks, while lite-srgan network is used for performing the super-resolution task. the proposed lite-unet outperforms u-net with slight gains of 0.06% and 0.12% for dice coefficient and intersection over union (iou) respectively while achieving significant reductions of 15.9x, 25x, and 6.6x in terms of parameters, floating-point operations per second (flops), and inference time respectively. in addition, the proposed lite-srgan achieves comparable qualitative and quantitative results compared to srgan with significant reductions of 7.5x, 7.8x, and 2.7x in terms of parameters, flops, and inference time respectively when upsampling the low-resolution images from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 (4x upscaling). similarly, it achieves a reduction of 7.1x, 11.2x, and 1.9x when upsampling from 128x128 to 256x256 (2x upscaling). for classification purposes, a two-stage classification approach is introduced, in which the crop species and their leaf diseases are recognized respectively. different models are utilized in both stages including mobilenetv3, densenet121, and convnext. the best accuracy obtained on the testing set is 99.76% when using the proposed methods together, which outperforms several other related studies. source code is available at https://github.com/hosamsherif/litesrgan-and-liteunet",AB_0433
"road extraction is still a challenging topic for researchers. currently, deep convolution neural networks are state-of-the-art in road network segmentation and are known for their remarkable ability to explore multilevel contexts. despite this, the architectures still suffer from occlusion and obstructions that cause discontinuities and omissions in extracted road networks. generally, these effects are minimized with strategies to obtain the context of the scene and not explore the complementarity of knowledge from a diversity of sources. we propose an early fusion network with rgb and surface model images that provide complementary geometric data to improve road surface extraction. our results demonstrate that unet_early reaches 71.01% intersection over union (iou) and 81.95% f1, and the fusion strategy increases the iou and f1 scores at 2.3% and 1.5%, respectively. besides, it overpassed the best model without fusion (deeplabv3+). the brazilian dataset and architecture implementation are available at https://github.com/tunofilho/ieee_road_multimodal.",AB_0433
"recent years have witnessed the great success of deep learning algorithms in the geoscience and remote sensing (rs) realm. nevertheless, the security and robustness of deep learning models deserve special attention when addressing safety-critical rs tasks. in this article, we provide a systematic analysis of backdoor attacks for rs data, where both scene classification and semantic segmentation tasks are considered. while most of the existing backdoor attack algorithms rely on visible triggers such as squared patches with well-designed patterns, we propose a novel wavelet transform-based attack (waba) method, which can achieve invisible attacks by injecting the trigger image into the poisoned image in the low-frequency domain. in this way, the high-frequency information in the trigger image can be filtered out in the attack, resulting in stealthy data poisoning. despite its simplicity, the proposed method can significantly cheat the current state-of-the-art deep learning models with a high attack success rate. we further analyze how different trigger images and the hyperparameters in the wavelet transform would influence the performance of the proposed method. extensive experiments on four benchmark rs datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for both scene classification and semantic segmentation tasks and thus highlight the importance of designing advanced backdoor defense algorithms to address this threat in rs scenarios. the code will be available online at https://github.com/ndraeger/waba.",AB_0433
"protein solubility prediction is essential to understand diverse types of biological processes and to explore the impact of different factors (ionic strength, temperature, ph of medium and electrostatic repulsion) on the productivity of proteins. it also plays an important role in disease analysis and drug development processes. protein solubility prediction through experimental approaches is time-consuming, labour intensive and error-prone. to empower the process of protein solubility prediction and facilitate large scale analysis, 16 different computational predictors have been proposed. however, these predictors have low predictive performance mainly due to extraction of less semantic and discriminative features from raw protein sequences. existing predictors either extract sequence order information or positional information, while both types of information are important to discriminate soluble and insoluble proteins. this paper presents a novel encoder ctapaac capable of generating statistical representations of protein sequences by extracting 4 different types of information correlation, distribution, composition and transition. over 4 benchmark datasets a comprehensive intrinsic and extrinsic performance analysis of proposed and 14 most widely used existing protein sequence encoders reveals that proposed encoder has more potential in transforming soluble and insoluble protein sequences into statistical vectors having discriminative patterns among soluble and insoluble classes. proposed encoder along with random forest classifier outperforms existing best performing protein solubility predictors with a significant margin of 6%, 7%, 25% and 10% over psi:biology, e.coli, price and esol datasets in terms of accuracy. source code of proposed predictor is publicly available at https://github.com/faiza-mehmood/rppsp.",AB_0433
"ultrasound imaging is one of the most prominent technologies to evaluate the growth, progression, and overall health of a fetus during its gestation. however, the interpretation of the data obtained from such studies is best left to expert physicians and technicians who are trained and well-versed in analyzing such images. to improve the clinical workflow and potentially develop an at-home ultrasound-based fetal monitoring platform, we present a novel fetus phantom ultrasound dataset, fpus23, which can be used to identify (1) the correct diagnostic planes for estimating fetal biometric values, (2) fetus orientation, (3) their anatomical features, and (4) bounding boxes of the fetus phantom anatomies at 23 weeks gestation. the entire dataset is composed of 15,728 images, which are used to train four different deep neural network models, built upon a resnet34 backbone, for detecting aforementioned fetus features and use-cases. we have also evaluated the models trained using our fpus23 dataset, to show that the information learned by these models can be used to substantially increase the accuracy on real-world ultrasound fetus datasets. we make the fpus23 dataset and the pre-trained models publicly accessible at https://github.com/bharathprabakaran/fpus23, which will further facilitate future research on fetal ultrasound imaging.",AB_0433
"neuropeptides (nps) are a kind of neuromodulator/ neurotransmitter that works as signaling molecules in the central nervous system, and perform major roles in physiological and hormone regulation activities. recently, machine learning-based therapeutic agents have gained the attention of researchers due to their high and reliable prediction results. however, the unsatisfactory performance of the existing predictors is due to their high execution cost and minimum predictive results. therefore, the development of a reliable prediction is highly indispensable for scientists to effectively predict nps. in this study, we presented an automatic and computationally effective model for identifying of nps. the evolutionary information is formulated using a bigram position-specific scoring matrix (bi-pssm) and k-spaced bigram (ksb). moreover, for noise reduction, a discrete wavelet transform (dwt) is utilized to form bi-pssm_dwt and ksb_dwt based high discriminative vectors. in addition, one-hot encoding is also employed to collect sequential features from peptide samples. finally, a multi-perspective feature set of sequential and embedded evolutionary information is formed. the optimum features are chosen from the extracted features via shapley additive explanations (shap) by evaluating the contribution of the extracted features. the optimal features are trained via six classification models i.e., xgb, etc, svm, ada, fknn, and lgbm. the predicted labels of these learners are then provided to a genetic algorithm to form an ensemble classification approach. hence, our model achieved a higher predictive accuracy of 94.47% and 92.55% using training sequences and independent sequences, respectively. which is similar to 3% highest predictive accuracy than present methods. it is suggested that our presented tool will be beneficial and may execute a substantial role in drug development and research academia. the source code and all datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/shahidawkum/target-ensc_np.",AB_0433
"background: long-acting injectable cabotegravir (cab-la) for preexposure prophylaxis (prep) has proven efficacious in randomized controlled trials. further research is critical to evaluate its effectiveness in real-world settings and identify effective implementation approaches, especially among young sexual and gender minorities (sgms).objective: imprep cab brasil is an implementation study aiming to generate critical evidence on the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of incorporating cab-la into the existing public health oral prep services in 6 brazilian cities. it will also evaluate a mobile health (mhealth) education and decision support tool, digital injection appointment reminders, and the facilitators of and barriers to integrating cab-la into the existing services.methods: this type-2 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study includes formative work, qualitative assessments, and clinical steps 1 to 4. for formative work, we will use participatory design methods to develop an initial cab-la implementation package and process mapping at each site to facilitate optimal client flow. sgms aged 18 to 30 years arriving at a study clinic interested in prep (naive) will be invited for step 1. individuals who tested hiv negative will receive mhealth intervention and standard of care (soc) counseling or soc for prep choice (oral or cab-la). participants interested in cab-la will be invited for step 2, and those with undetectable hiv viral load will receive same-day cab-la injection and will be randomized to receive digital appointment reminders or soc. clinical appointments and cab-la injection are scheduled after 1 month and every 2 months thereafter (25-month follow-up). participants will be invited to a 1-year follow-up to step 3 if they decide to change to oral prep or discontinue cab-la and to step 4 if diagnosed with hiv during the study. outcomes of interest include prep acceptability, choice, effectiveness, implementation, and feasibility. hiv incidence in the cab-la cohort (n=1200) will be compared with that in a similar oral prep cohort from the public health system. the effectiveness of the mhealth and digital interventions will be assessed using interrupted time series analysis and logistic mixed models, respectively.results: during the third and fourth quarters of 2022, we obtained regulatory approvals; programmed data entry and management systems; trained sites; and performed community consultancy and formative work. study enrollment is programmed for the second quarter of 2023.conclusions: imprep cab brasil is the first study to evaluate cab-la prep implementation in latin america, one of the regions where prep scale-up is most needed. this study will be fundamental to designing programmatic strategies for implementing and scaling up feasible, equitable, cost-effective, sustainable, and comprehensive alternatives for prep programs. it will also contribute to maximizing the impact of a public health approach to reducing hiv incidence among sgms in brazil and other countries in the global south.trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct05515770; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct05515770international registered report identifier (irrid): prr1-10.2196/44961",AB_0433
"convolutional neural networks (cnns) have recently found great attention in image classification since deep cnns have exhibited excellent performance in computer vision. owing to their immense success, of late, scientists are exploring the functionality of transformers in earth observation applications. nevertheless, the primary issue with transformers is that they demand significantly more training data than cnn classifiers. thus, the use of these transformers in remote sensing is considered challenging, notably in utilizing polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (polsar) data, due to the insufficient number of existing labeled data. in this letter, we develop and propose a vision transformer (vit)-based framework that utilizes 3-d and 2-d cnns as feature extractors and, in addition, local window attention (lwa) for the effective classification of polsar data. extensive experimental results demonstrated that the developed model polsarformer obtained better classification accuracy than the state-of-the-art vision swin transformer and fnet algorithms. the polsarformer outperformed the swin transformer and fnet by the margin of 5.86% and 17.63%, in terms of average accuracy (aa) in the san francisco data benchmark. moreover, the results over the flevoland dataset illustrated that the polsarformer exceeds several other algorithms, including the resnet (97.49%), swin transformer (96.54%), fnet (95.28%), 2-d cnn (94.57%), and alexnet (91.83%), with a kappa index (ki) of 99.30%. the code will be made available publicly at https://github.com/aj1365/polsarformer.",AB_0433
"background: nearly 30% of patients with rectal cancer develop local regrowth after initial clinical complete response managed by watch and wait. these patients might be at higher risk for distant metastases. objective: this study aimed to investigate risk factors for distant metastases using time-dependent analyses. design: data from an international watch and wait database were retrospectively reviewed. cox regression analysis was used to determine risk factors for worse distant metastases-free survival. conditional survival modeling was used to investigate the impact of risk factors on the development of distant metastases. setting: retrospective, multicenter database. patients: a total of 793 patients (47 institutions) with rectal cancer and clinical complete response to neoadjuvant treatment from the international watch & wait database were included. main outcome measures: distant metastases-free survival. results: of the 793 patients managed with watch and wait (median follow-up 55.2 mo), 85 patients (10.7%) had distant metastases. fifty-one of 85 patients (60%) had local regrowth at any time. local regrowth was an independent factor associated with worse distant metastases-free survival in the multivariable model. using conditional estimates, patients with local regrowth without distant metastases for 5 years (from decision to watch and wait) remained at higher risk for development of distant metastases for 1 subsequent year compared to patients without local regrowth (5-year conditional distant metastases-free survival 94.9% vs 98.4%). limitations: lack of information on adjuvant chemotherapy, salvage surgery for local regrowth, and heterogeneity of individual surveillance/follow-up strategies used may have affected results. conclusions: in patients with clinical complete response managed by watch and wait, development of local regrowth at any time is a risk factor for distant metastases. the risk of distant metastases remains higher for 5 years after development of local regrowth. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c53.",AB_0433
"short non-coding rnas (sncrnas) are involved in multiple cellular processes and can be divided into dozens of classes. among such classes, y rnas have been gaining attention, being essential factors for the initiation of dna replication on vertebrates, as well as potential tumor biomarkers. homologs have also been described in nematodes and insects, as well as related sequences in bacteria. methods capable of accurately predicting y rna transcripts are lacking. in this work, we developed an attention-based lstm network and built a classification model able to classify sncrnas (including y rna) directly from nucleotide sequences. a dataset consisting of 45,447 sncrna sequences, from a wide range of organisms, obtained from rfam 14.3 was built. performance evaluation demonstrated that our proposed method, ncypred (non-coding/y rna prediction), can accurately predict y rna sequences and their homologs, as well as 11 additional classes, achieving results comparable with state-of-the-art methods. we also demonstrate that applying t-sne on learned sequence representations could be useful for sequence analysis. our model is freely available as a web-server (https://www.gpea.uem.br/ncypred/).",AB_0433
