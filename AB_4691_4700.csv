"acceleration in mri has garnered much attention from the deep-learning community in recent years, particularly for imaging large anatomical volumes such as the abdomen or moving targets such as the heart. a variety of deep learning approaches have been investigated, with most existing works using convolutional neural network (cnn)-based architectures as the reconstruction backbone, paired with fixed, rather than learned, k-space undersampling patterns. in both image domain and k-space, cnn-based architectures may not be optimal for reconstruction due to its limited ability to capture long-range dependencies. furthermore, fixed undersampling patterns, despite ease of implementation, may not lead to optimal reconstruction. lastly, few deep learning models to date have leveraged temporal correlation across dynamic mri data to improve reconstruction. to address these gaps, we present a dual-domain (image and k-space), transformer-based reconstruction network, paired with learning-based undersampling that accepts temporally correlated sequences of mri images for dy-namic reconstruction. we call our model dudretlu-net. we train the network end-to-end against fully sampled ground truth dataset. human cardiac cine images undersampled at different factors (5-100) were tested. reconstructed images were assessed both visually and quantitatively via the structural similarity index, mean squared error, and peak signal-to-noise. experimental results show superior performance of dudretlu-net over state-of-the-art methods (loupe, k-t slr, bm3d-mri) in accelerated mri reconstruction; ablation studies show that transformer-based reconstruction outperformed cnn-based reconstruction in both image domain and k -space; dual-domain reconstruction architectures outperformed single-domain reconstruction architectures regardless of reconstruction backbone (cnn or transformer); and dynamic sequence input leads to more accurate reconstructions than single frame input. we expect our results to encourage further research in the use of dual-domain architectures, transformer-based architectures, and learning-based undersampling, in the setting of accelerated mri reconstruction. the code for this project is made freely available at https://github.com/ william2343/dual-domain-mri-recon-nets (hong et al., 2022).",AB_0470
"rooted trees are ubiquitous data structures which are used to model hierarchical objects from a plethora of different application domains. for various downstream analysis tasks, measures are needed that quan-tify (dis-)similarity between rooted trees. many such measures exist, e. g., the widely used tree edit dis-tance (ted). however, there are few algorithms to compute (dis-)similarity measures which are specifi-cally designed for rooted, unordered, node-labeled trees and support input trees of different orders. to close this gap in the literature, we introduce the edge-preservation similarity (eps). we show how to exactly compute eps via integer quadratic programming on small instances and present a scalable 4-approximation algorithm. an evaluation on tree representations of pseudoknotted rna secondary struc-tures and acyclic molecular graphs shows that both exact and approximate (normalized) eps better preserves functional similarities between the compared rnas and molecules than the often-used ted. python implementations of our algorithms and scripts to reproduce the results are available on github: https://github.com/bionetslab/edge-preservation-similarity .

"signature synthesis is a computation technique that generates artificial specimens which can support decision making in automatic signature verification. a lot of work has been dedicated to this subject, which centres on synthesizing dynamic and static two-dimensional handwriting on canvas. this paper proposes a framework to generate synthetic 3d on-air signatures exploiting the lognormality principle, which mimics the complex neuromotor control processes at play as the fingertip moves. addressing the usual cases involving the development of artificial individuals and duplicated samples, this paper con-tributes to the synthesis of: (1) the trajectory and velocity of entirely 3d new signatures; (2) kinematic information when only the 3d trajectory of the signature is known, and (3) duplicate samples of 3d real signatures. validation was conducted by generating synthetic 3d signature databases mimicking real ones and showing that automatic signature verifications of genuine and skilled forgeries report performances similar to those of real and synthetic databases. we also observed that training 3d automatic signature verifiers with duplicates can reduce errors. we further demonstrated that our proposal is also valid for synthesizing 3d air writing and gestures. finally, a perception test confirmed the human likeness of the generated specimens. the databases generated are publicly available, only for research purposes, at https://gpds.ulpgc.es.(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0470
"complex molecular mixtures are encountered in almost all research disciplines, such as biomedical 'omics, petroleomics, and environmental sciences. state-of-the-art characterization of sample materials related to these fields, deploying high-end instrumentation, allows for gathering large quantities of molecular composition data. one established technological platform is ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry, e.g., fourier-transform mass spectrometry (ft-ms). however, the huge amounts of data acquired in ft-ms often result in tedious data treatment and visualization. ft-ms analysis of complex matrices can easily lead to single mass spectra with more than 10,000 attributed unique molecular formulas. sophisticated software solutions to conduct these treatment and visualization attempts from commercial and noncommercial origins exist. however, existing applications have distinct drawbacks, such as focusing on only one type of graphic representation, being unable to handle large data sets, or not being publicly available. in this respect, we developed a software, within the international complex matrices molecular characterization joint lab (ic2mc), named python tools for complex matrices molecular characterization (pyc2mc). this piece of software will be open-source and free to use. pyc2mc is written under python 3.9.7 and relies on well-known libraries such as pandas, numpy, or scipy. it is provided with a graphical user interface developed under pyqt5. the two options for execution, (1) a user-friendly route with a prepacked executable file or (2) running the main python script through a python interpreter, ensure a high applicability but also an open characteristic for further development by the community. both are available on the github platform (https://github.com/ic2mc/pyc2mc_viewer).",AB_0470
"abiotic stresses negatively impact ecosystems and the yield of crops, and climate change will increase their frequency and intensity. despite progress in understanding how plants respond to individual stresses, our knowledge of plant acclimatization to combined stresses typically occurring in nature is still lacking. here, we used a plant with minimal regulatory network redundancy, marchantia polymorpha, to study how seven abiotic stresses, alone and in 19 pairwise combinations, affect the phenotype, gene expression, and activity of cellular pathways. while the transcriptomic responses show a conserved differential gene expression between arabidopsis and marchantia, we also observe a strong functional and transcriptional divergence between the two species. the reconstructed high-confidence gene regulatory network demonstrates that the response to specific stresses dominates those of others by relying on a large ensemble of transcription factors. we also show that a regression model could accurately predict the gene expression under combined stresses, indicating that marchantia performs arithmetic multiplication to respond to multiple stresses. lastly, two online resources (https://conekt.plant.tools and http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp_marchantia/cgi-bin/efpweb.cgi) are provided to facilitate the study of gene expression in marchantia exposed to abiotic stresses. how plants respond to multiple stresses occurring simultaneously is poorly understood. here the authors describe how gene expression in marchantia polymorpha responds to different combinations of seven abiotic stresses and provide online resources to facilitate data visualization and usability.",AB_0470
"this study is concerned with urban change detection and categorization in point clouds. in such situations, objects are mainly characterized by their vertical axis, and the use of native 3d data such as 3d point clouds (pcs) is, in general, preferred to rasterized versions because of significant loss of information implied by any rasterization process. yet, for obvious practical reasons, most existing studies only focus on 2d images for change detection purpose. in this paper, we propose a method capable of performing change detection directly within 3d data. despite recent deep learning developments in remote sensing, to the best of our knowledge there is no such method to tackle multi-class change segmentation that directly processes raw 3d pcs. thereby, based on advances in deep learning for change detection in 2d images and for analysis of 3d point clouds, we propose a deep siamese kpconv network that deals with raw 3d pcs to perform change detection and categorization in a single step. experimental results are conducted on synthetic and real data of various kinds (lidar, multi-sensors). tests performed on simulated low density lidar and multi-sensor datasets show that our proposed method can obtain up to 80% of mean of iou over classes of changes, leading to an improvement ranging from 10% to 30% over the state-of-the-art. a similar range of improvements is attainable on real data. then, we show that pre-training siamese kpconv on simulated pcs allows us to greatly reduce (more than 3,000x) the annotations required on real data. this is a highly significant result to deal with practical scenarios. finally, an adaptation of siamese kpconv is realized to deal with change classification at pc scale. our network overtakes the current state-of-the-art deep learning method by 23% and 15% of mean of iou when assessed on synthetic and public change3d datasets, respectively. the code is available at the following link: https://github.com/idegelis/torch-points3d-siamesekpconv.",AB_0470
"predicting the trajectory of a disease at an early stage can aid physicians in offering effective treatment, prompt care to patients, and also avoid misdiagnosis. however, forecasting patient trajectories is challenging due to long-range dependencies, irregular intervals between consecutive admissions, and non-stationarity data. to address these challenges, we propose a novel method called clinical-gan, a transformer-based generative adversarial networks (gan) to forecast the patients' medical codes for subsequent visits. first, we represent the patients' medical codes as a time-ordered sequence of tokens akin to language models. then, a transformer mechanism is used as a generator to learn from existing patients' medical history and is trained adversarially against a transformer-based discriminator. we address the above mentioned challenges based on our data modeling and transformer-based gan architecture. additionally, we enable the local interpretation of the model's prediction using a multi-head attention mechanism. we evaluated our method using a publicly available dataset, medical information mart for intensive care iv v1.0 (mimic-iv), with more than 500,000 visits completed by around 196,000 adult patients over an 11-year period from 2008-2019. clinical-gan significantly outperforms baseline methods and existing works, as demonstrated through various experiments. source code is at https://github.com/vigi30/clinical-gan.",AB_0470
"asc-g4 is an algorithm for the calculation of the ad-vanced structural characteristics of g-quadruplexes (g4). it allows the unambiguous determination of the intramolecular g4 topology, based on the oriented strand numbering. it also resolves the ambiguity in the determination of the guanine glycosidic configu-ration. with this algorithm, we showed that the use of the c3' or c5' atoms to calculate the groove width in g4 is more appropriate than the p atoms and that the groove width does not always reflect the space avail-able within the groove. for the latter, the minimum groove width is more appropriate. the application of asc-g4 to 207 g4 structures guided the choices made for the calculations. a website based on asc-g4 (http://tiny.cc/asc-g4) was created, where the user uploads his g4 structure and gets its topology, the types of its loops and their lengths, the presence of snapbacks and bulges, the distribution of gua-nines in the tetrads and strands, the glycosidic con-figuration of these guanines, their rise, the groove widths, the minimum groove widths, the tilt and twist angles, the backbone dihedral angles, etc. it also pro -vides a large number of atom-atom and atom-plane distances that are relevant to evaluating the quality of the structure.",AB_0470
"we present the second update of wordom, a user-friendly and efficient program for manipulation and analysis of conformational ensembles from molecular simulations. the actual update expands some of the existing modules and adds 21 new modules to the update 1 published in 2011. the new adds can be divided into three sets that: 1) analyze atomic fluctuations and structural communication; 2) explore ion-channel conformational dynamics and ionic translocation; and 3) compute geometrical indices of structural de-formation. set 1 serves to compute correlations of motions, find geometrically stable domains, identify a dynamically invariant core, find changes in domain-domain separation and mutual orientation, perform wavelet analysis of large-scale simulations, process the output of principal component analysis of atomic fluctuations, perform functional mode analysis, infer regions of mechanical rigidity, analyze overall fluc-tuations, and perform the perturbation response scanning. set 2 includes modules specific for ion channels, which serve to monitor the pore radius as well as water or ion fluxes, and measure functional collective motions like receptor twisting or tilting angles. finally, set 3 includes tools to monitor structural de-formations by computing angles, perimeter, area, volume, beta-sheet curvature, radial distribution function, and center of mass. the ring perception module is also included, helpful to monitor supramolecular self -assemblies. this update places wordom among the most suitable, complete, user-friendly, and efficient software for the analysis of biomolecular simulations. the source code of wordom and the relative doc-umentation are available under the gnu general public license at http://wordom.sf.net.(c) 2023 published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of research network of computational and structural biotechnology. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ( licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0470
