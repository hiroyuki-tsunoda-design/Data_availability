"national immunization technical advisory groups (nitags) develop immunization-related recommenda-tions and assist policy-makers in making evidence informed decisions. systematic reviews (srs) that summarize the available evidence on a specific topic are a valuable source of evidence in the develop-ment of such recommendations. however, conducting srs requires significant human, time, and financial resources, which many nitags lack. given that srs already exist for many immunization-related topics, and to prevent duplication and overlap of reviews, a more practical approach may be for nitags to use existing srs. nevertheless, it can be challenging to identify relevant srs, to select one sr from among multiple srs, or to critically assess and effectively use them. to support nitags, the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, robert koch institute and col-laborators developed the sysvac project, which consists of an online registry of systematic reviews on immunization-related topics and an e-learning course, that supports the use of them (both freely acces-sible at https://www.nitag-resource.org/sysvac-systematic-reviews). drawing from the e-learning course and recommendations from an expert panel, this paper outlines methods for using existing systematic reviews when making immunization-related recommendations. with specific examples and reference to the sysvac registry and other resources, it offers guidance on locating existing systematic reviews; assessing their relevance to a research question, up-to-dateness, and methodological quality and/or risk of bias; and considering the transferability and applicability of their findings to other populations or settings.

"hjalli-olfus is the westernmost segment of the east-west transform south iceland seismic zone (sisz), which is the eastward extension of the similar to ene-trending transtensional reykjanes peninsula (rp). historically, the area has shown an interactive behavior with the hengill volcanic system to the north and the central sisz to the east. we analyzed the state of stress and faulting mechanisms in hjalli-olfus between july 1991 and december 1999, in connection with the hengill inflation episode (feigl et al., 2000, https://doi. org/10.1029/2000jb900209) and the 13th november 1998 mw 5.1 hjalli-olfus earthquake. we find that this region predominantly hosted oblique-normal and left-lateral strike-slip events (4-10 km-depth), with most nodal planes oriented along similar to ene or similar to wsw directions (75 degrees +/- 15 degrees or 255 degrees +/- 15 degrees). we identify 5 stages of stress evolution from january 1991 to december 1999 over which hjalli-olfus experiences both spatial and temporal shifts in stress-states. the hengill inflation likely loaded both the fissure zone and western olfus, culminating in the mw 5.4 (hengill) and mw 5.1 (hjalli-olfus) earthquakes. following these events, the maximum compressive stress (shmax) orientation near the location of the mw 5.1 earthquake showed a similar to 5 degrees-7 degrees counterclockwise swing, compared to shmax before june 1998. the average shmax (similar to 40 degrees +/- 1 degrees) and minimum principal s....tress (sigma(3) similar to 130 degrees +/- 1 degrees) are comparable to geological trends in the rp. we conclude that hjalli-olfus shows clockwise shmax rotation upon loading, while a stress-drop reverses the rotation. we also posit that the region, especially the western end, behaves like the rp during interseismic periods. plain language summary iceland hosts a predominantly rifting plate boundary that is offset by two similar to east-west trending, horizontally sliding (transform-faulting) segments, one in the north and the other in the south. the southern segment, known as the south iceland seismic zone (sisz), is seismically productive and is flanked by diverging volcanic arms. the sisz has hosted several moderate to large earthquakes on north-south faults that cut across it. however, the westernmost end of the sisz, also known as hjalli-olfus, differs from the rest of the sisz as it seems to host earthquakes in an similar to east-northeast direction, similar to its western, rifting neighbor, namely, the reykjanes peninsula. the activity in hjalli-olfus also seems to be responsive to volcanic/magmatic activity in the hengill volcano to its north. this suggests the existence of multiple stress fields-volcanic, tectonic, or both-acting on the hjalli-olfus segment. here, we study earthquakes in hjalli-olfus from january 1991 to december 1999, including a magnitude 5.1 earthquake in november 1998, to identify possible stress changes along the segment over time. results indicate that magmatic deformation and seismic activity near the hengill volcano directly influence the seismic productivity of hjalli-olfus, and that this seismicity is similar to that of the reykjanes peninsula.",AB_0411
"the computational methods for the prediction of gene function annotations aim to automatically find associations between a gene and a set of gene ontology (go) terms describing its functions. since the hand-made curation process of novel annotations and the corresponding wet experiments validations are very time-consuming and costly procedures, there is a need for computational tools that can reliably predict likely annotations and boost the discovery of new gene functions. this work proposes a novel method for predicting annotations based on the inference of go similarities from expression similarities. the novel method was benchmarked against other methods on several public biological datasets, obtaining the best comparative results. exp2go effectively improved the prediction of go annotations in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. furthermore, the proposal was validated with a full genome case where it was capable of predicting relevant and accurate biological functions. the repository of this project withh full data and code is available at https://github.com/sinc-lab/exp2go.",AB_0411
"trinidad and tobago is a small island developing state (sids) with one of the largest emitters of co2 per capita globally -linked to a reliance on oil and gas. with the country's commitment to sustainable development goals and climate change agreements, rapid redesign of the national power sector is critical to promoting a sustainable energy tran-sition. our study examines the minimisation of electricity costs (lcoe) and greenhouse gas emissions (ghg(lc)), using a mixed-integer linear programming model (milp) across 5 scenarios describing the national power generation system. our results show an lcoe of $(usd) 61.72 per mwh and ghg(lc) of 756 kgco(2eq) per mwh, attributed to current take-or-pay power purchasing agreements (ppa) aligned to scenario 1 a. coupled improvements in power generation technology and resource efficiency (scenario 2), results in lcoe and ghglc reductions of up to 40% ($(usd) 36.94 per mwh) and 24% (572 kgco(2eq) per mwh), respectively. furthermore, the incorporation of low carbon h-2, meoh and nh3 into the process system was deemed infeasible at current prices, despite potential avoided emissions when compared to local business-as-usual operations. lastly, looking ahead to 2030 shows a general increase in lcoe of $(usd) 8.5 - 14 per mwh and ghg(lc) of 8 - 27 kgco(2eq), attributed to higher grid demand and natural gas prices. thus, our results support the need for new policies linked to active decarbonisation within the national energy sector and removal of current legislation that discourages the application of low carbon technologies linked to sustainable development. ultimately, through a multi-objective optimisation framework, our results highlight the value of systems-based planning and implementation in the sustainable energy transition across the caribbean region, in ac-cordance with sustainable development goals (sdgs).

"introduction despite clear linkages between provision of clean water and improvements in child health, limited information exists about the health impacts of large water infrastructure improvements in low-income settings. billions of dollars are spent annually to improve urban water supply, and rigorous evaluation of these improvements, especially targeting informal settlements, is critical to guide policy and investment strategies. objective measures of infection and exposure to pathogens, and measures of gut function, are needed to understand the effectiveness and impact of water supply improvements. methods and analysis in the paasim study, we examine the impact of water system improvements on acute and chronic health outcomes in children in a low-income urban area of beira, mozambique, comprising 62 sub-neighbourhoods and similar to 26 300 households. this prospective matched cohort study follows 548 mother-child dyads from late pregnancy through 12 months of age. primary outcomes include measures of enteric pathogen infections, gut microbiome composition and source drinking water microbiological quality, measured at the child's 12-month visit. additional outcomes include diarrhoea prevalence, child growth, previous enteric pathogen exposure, child mortality and various measures of water access and quality. our analyses will compare (1) subjects living in sub-neighbourhoods with the improved water to those living in sub-neighbourhoods without these improvements; and (2) subjects with household water connections on their premises to those without such a connection. this study will provide critical information to understand how to optimise investments for improving child health, filling the information gap about the impact of piped water provision to low-income urban households, using novel gastrointestinal disease outcomes. ethics and dissemination this study was approved by the emory university institutional review board and the national bio-ethics committee for health in mozambique. the pre-analysis plan is published on the open science framework platform (https://osf.io/4rkn6/). results will be shared with relevant stakeholders locally, and through publications.",AB_0411
"previous research shows the beneficial effects of an intradialytic resistance training (irt) on muscle function in haemodialysis patients. however, patients vary highly in their functional responses to irt, may be due to effects of age and sex heterogeneities in adaptation. therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the degree to which the effects of irt on the muscle function of haemodialysis patients vary by age and sex. we included 57 patients who completed a 12-week irt (exg) and 33 patients who received no irt (cng) during haemodialysis. muscle function (mf) was assessed using dynamometry before and after a 12-week intervention and after a 12-week follow-up. after the 12-week intervention, we found a moderation effect of age in the relative (%) change (p = 0.011) and absolute (?) change (p = 0.027) of mf, and a moderation effect of sex in %mf (p = 0.001), but not in ?mf (p = 0.069). regarding patients' age, the change of mf was only significantly different between exg and cng patients aged 60-70 years (%mf, exg: + 34.6%, cng: - 20.1%, p < 0.001; ?mf, exg: + 44.4 n, cng: - 22.1 n, p < 0.001). regarding patients' sex, the change of mf was only significantly different between exg and cng female patients (%mf, exg: + 23.9%, cng: - 23.6%, p < 0.001). age and sex did not significantly moderate changes in mf measures after 12 weeks of follow-up. we conclude that both age and sex of haemodialysis patients affect their functional response to irt in the short term.trial registration: intradialytic resistance training in haemodialysis patients (irthep)-#nct03511924, 30/04/2018, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03511924 .",AB_0411

"we describe the new version 2.0.0 of the code dirqfam that calculates the multipole response of even-even axially symmetric deformed nuclei using the framework of relativistic self-consistent mean-field models. the response is calculated by implementing the finite amplitude method for relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation. in the new version, we have implemented the following features: (i) meson-exchange interactions, (ii) low-rank method for calculating induced densities and currents, (iii) generalized minimal residual method (gmres), (iv) evaluation of the nucleon localization function, (v) extraction of the qrpa transition matrix elements and eigenfrequencies, (vi) evaluation of the h11 part of the induced hamiltonian, (vii) multipole excitation operators up to j <= 5 are now included.program summary program title: dirqfam v2.0.0 cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /6gv8nxg4ns .2 licensing provisions: gplv3 programming language: fortran 90. external routines/libraries: blas/lapack, version 3.1. or higher. journal reference of previous version: a. bjelcic, t. niksic, comp. phys. comm. 253, 107184 (2020). does the new version supersede the previous version?: yes nature of problem: multipole response of deformed even-even open-shell nuclei can be calculated using the quasiparticle finite amplitude method (qfam), based on the relativistic self-consistent mean-field models. the particle-hole channel is described by a zero-range relativistic effective interaction or interaction based on meson exchange, while the particle-particle channel of the effective inter-nucleon interaction is described by a separable finite-range pairing force. the method can be applied to perform systematic studies of collective modes even in heavy deformed nuclei. solution method: the current implementation computes the multipole response by solving the qfam equations in a self-consistent iteration scheme. at each iteration the qfam solutions are updated using the gmres method. the qfam amplitudes are expanded in the simplex-y harmonic oscillator basis. summary of revisions:1. meson-exchange interaction are included in the code; 2. calculation of the nucleon localization function; 3. extraction of the qrpa transition matrix elements and eigenfrequencies; 4. evaluation of the h11 part of the induced hamiltonian; 5. multipoles excitation operators up to j <= 5 are included; 6. low-rank method for calculating induced densities and currents; 7. generalized minimal residual method; 8. dynamic memory allocation; 9. reduced memory requirements;additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: open-shell even-even nuclei with parity conserved axially symmetric ground states are considered. an electric multipole operator with j <= 5 is used to calculate the response function.(c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0411
"to achieve optimal robot behavior in dynamic scenarios we need to consider complex dynamics in a predictive manner. in the vehicle dynamics community, it is well know that to achieve time-optimal driving on low friction surface, the vehicle should utilize drifting. hence, many authors have devised rules to split circuits and employ drifting on some segments. these rules are suboptimal and do not generalize to arbitrary circuit shapes (e.g., s-like curves). so, the question when to go into which mode and how to drive in it? remains unanswered. to choose the suitable mode (discrete decision), the algorithm needs information about the feasibility of different modes (continuous motion). this makes it a class of task and motion planning (tamp) problems, which are known to be hard to solve optimally in real-time. in the ai planning community, search methods are commonly used. however, they cannot be directly applied to tamp problems due to the continuous component. here, we present a search-based method that effectively solves this problem and efficiently searches in a highly dimensional state space with nonlinear and unstable dynamics. the space of the possible trajectories is explored by sampling different combinations of motion primitives guided by the search. our approach allows to use multiple locally approximated models to generate motion primitives (e.g., learned models of drifting) and effectively simplify the problem without losing accuracy. the algorithm performance is evaluated in simulated driving on a mixed-track with segments of different curvatures (right and left). our code is available at https://git.io/jenvb.",AB_0411
"background: whether prebiotic human milk oligosaccharides (hmo), such as 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-fl) and lacto-n-neotetraose (lnnt), enhance iron absorption in infants is unknown. moreover, whether maternal hmo profile affects absorption of iron fortificants or the effects of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (gos) and/or hmo on iron absorption is uncertain. objectives: the aim of this study was to test whether consumption of 3.0 g gos or hmo enhances iron absorption from iron-fortified maize porridge in partially breastfed kenyan infants and whether maternal hmo profile modulates these effects. methods: in a randomized, prospective crossover study, 55 infants (aged 8-12 mo) were fed test meals fortified with 1 of the following: 1) 5.0 mg iron as 54fe-labeled ferrous fumarate (fefum); 2) 5.0 mg iron as 58fefum and 3.0 g gos (fefumthorngos); and 3) 5.0 mg iron as (57)fefum and 2.0 g 2'-fl and 1.0 g lnnt (fefumthornhmo). fractional iron absorption (fia) was assessed by erythrocyte incorporation of iron isotopes. hmo profiles were determined by capillary gel electrophoresis with laser-induced florescence detection. data were analyzed with mixed-effect models, and iron dialyzability was measured in vitro. results: of the 55 infants included, 49 were fed as instructed. fia from the fefumthorngos group [median (iqr) 22.2% (16.5%-25.9%)] was higher than that from the fefum group [12.5% (9.5%-20.9%)] (p = 0.005). fia from the fefumthornhmo group was 13.3% (7.1%-24.4%) and did not differ from the fefum group (p = 0.923). maternal hmo profile did not predict fia or modulate the effects of gos or hmo on fia. iron dialyzability ratios at ph 2 of fefumthorngos to fefum and fefumthornhmo to fefum were 2.1 and 0.9 (p = 0.001 and p = 0.322), respectively. conclusions: in kenyan infants consuming fefum-fortified maize porridge, co-provision of 3.0 g gos increased fia by 78%, whereas co-provision of 3.0 g hmo did not affect fia. variations in maternal hmo profile, including secretor and lewis phenotype, did not predict fia. these data argue against a physiologic role for 2'-fl and lnnt in facilitating iron absorption in infancy. the study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as nct04163406 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04163406).",AB_0411
