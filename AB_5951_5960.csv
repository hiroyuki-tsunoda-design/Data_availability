"motivation the two strands of the dna double helix locally and spontaneously separate and recombine in living cells due to the inherent thermal dna motion. this dynamics results in transient openings in the double helix and is referred to as dna breathing or dna bubbles. the propensity to form local transient openings is important in a wide range of biological processes, such as transcription, replication, and transcription factors binding. however, the modeling and computer simulation of these phenomena, have remained a challenge due to the complex interplay of numerous factors, such as, temperature, salt content, dna sequence, hydrogen bonding, base stacking, and others.results we present pydna-epbd, a parallel software implementation of the extended peyrard-bishop-dauxois (epbd) nonlinear dna model that allows us to describe some features of dna dynamics in detail. the pydna-epbd generates genomic scale profiles of average base-pair openings, base flipping probability, dna bubble probability, and calculations of the characteristically dynamic length indicating the number of base pairs statistically significantly affected by a single point mutation using the markov chain monte carlo algorithm.availability and implementation pydna-epbd is supported across most operating systems and is freely available at https://github.com/lanl/pydna_epbd. extensive documentation can be found at https://lanl.github.io/pydna_epbd/.",AB_0596
"motivation the lincs l1000 project has collected gene expression profiles for thousands of compounds across a wide array of concentrations, cell lines, and time points. however, conventional analysis methods often fall short in capturing the rich information encapsulated within the l1000 transcriptional dose-response data.results we present dose-l1000, a database that unravels the potency and efficacy of compound-gene pairs and the intricate landscape of compound-induced transcriptional changes. our study uses the fitting of over 140 million generalized additive models and robust linear models, spanning the complete spectrum of compounds and landmark genes within the lincs l1000 database. this systematic approach provides quantitative insights into differential gene expression and the potency and efficacy of compound-gene pairs across diverse cellular contexts. through examples, we showcase the application of dose-l1000 in tasks such as cell line and compound comparisons, along with clustering analyses and predictions of drug-target interactions. dose-l1000 fosters applications in drug discovery, accelerating the transition to omics-driven drug development.availability and implementation dose-l1000 is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8286375.",AB_0596

"digital reconstructions provide an accurate and reliable way to store, share, model, quantify, and analyze neural morphology. continuous advances in cellular labeling, tissue processing, microscopic imaging, and automated tracing catalyzed a proliferation of software applications to reconstruct neural morphology. these computer programs typically encode the data in custom file formats. the resulting format heterogeneity severely hampers the interoperability and reusability of these valuable data. among these many alternatives, the swc file format has emerged as a popular community choice, coalescing a rich ecosystem of related neuroinformatics resources for tracing, visualization, analysis, and simulation. this report presents a standardized specification of the swc file format. in addition, we introduce xyz2swc, a free online service that converts all 26 reconstruction formats (and 72 variations) described in the scientific literature into the swc standard. the xyz2swc service is available open source through a user-friendly browser interface (https://neuromorpho.org/xyz2swc/ui/) and an application programming interface (api).",AB_0596

"background: the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria directly contributes to a wave of untreatable infections. the lack of new drug development is an important driver of this crisis. most antibiotics today are small molecules that block vital processes in bacteria. to optimize such effects, the three-dimensional structure of targeted bacterial proteins is imperative, although such a task is time-consuming and tedious, impeding the development of antibiotics. the development of rna-based therapeutics has catalyzed a new platform of antibiotics-antisense oligonucleotides (asos). these molecules hybridize with their target mrnas with high specificity, knocking down or interfering with protein translation. this study aims to develop a bioinformatics pipeline to identify potent aso targets in essential bacterial genes.methods: three bacterial species (p. gingivalis, h. influenzae, and s. aureus) were used to demonstrate the utility of the pipeline. open reading frames of bacterial essential genes were downloaded from the database of essential genes (deg). after filtering for specificity and accessibility, aso candidates were ranked based on their self-hybridization score, predicted melting temperature, and the position on the gene in an operon. enrichment analysis was conducted on genes associated with putative potent asos.results: a total of 45,628 asos were generated from 348 unique essential genes in p. gingivalis. a total of 1,117 of them were considered putative. a total of 27,273 asos were generated from 191 unique essential genes in h. influenzae. a total of 847 of them were considered putative. a total of 175,606 asos were generated from 346 essential genes in s. aureus. a total of 7,061 of them were considered putative. critical biological processes associated with these genes include translation, regulation of cell shape, cell division, and peptidoglycan biosynthetic process. putative aso targets generated for each bacterial species are publicly available here: https://github.com/ ericsho/aoa. the results demonstrate that our bioinformatics pipeline is useful in identifying unique and accessible aso targets in bacterial species that post major public health issues.",AB_0596
"comprehensive characterization of the relationship between protein expression and the genetic, pharmacogenomic, and immune landscape of tumors across cancer types provides a foundation for investigating the role of protein expression in cancer development and treatment. proteomics is a powerful approach that can rapidly enhance our understanding of cancer development. detailed characterization of the genetic, pharmacogenomic, and immune landscape in relation to protein expression in patients with cancer could provide new insights into the functional roles of proteins in cancer. by taking advantage of the genotype data from the cancer genome atlas and protein expression data from the cancer proteome atlas, we characterized the effects of genetic variants on protein expression across 31 cancer types and identified approximately 100,000 protein quantitative trait loci (pqtl). among these, over 8000 pqtls were associated with patient overall survival. furthermore, characterization of the impact of protein expression on more than 350 imputed anticancer drug responses in patients revealed nearly 230,000 significant associations. in addition, approximately 21,000 significant associations were identified between protein expression and immune cell abundance. finally, a user-friendly data portal, gpip (https://hanlaboratory.com/gpip), was developed featuring multiple modules that enable researchers to explore, visualize, and browse multidimensional data. this detailed analysis reveals the associations between the proteomic landscape and genetic variation, patient outcome, the immune microenvironment, and drug response across cancer types, providing a resource that may offer valuable clinical insights and encourage further functional investigations of proteins in cancer.significance: comprehensive characterization of the relationship between protein expression and the genetic, pharmacogenomic, and immune landscape of tumors across cancer types provides a foundation for investigating the role of protein expression in cancer development and treatment.",AB_0596
"the reference sequence (refseq) project at the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) contains over 315 000 bacterial and archaeal genomes and 236 million proteins with up-to-date and consistent annotation. in the past 3 years, we have expanded the diversity of the refseq collection by including the best quality metagenome-assembled genomes (mags) submitted to insdc (ddbj, ena and genbank), while maintaining its quality by adding validation checks. assemblies are now more stringently evaluated for contamination and for completeness of annotation prior to acceptance into refseq. mags now account for over 17000 assemblies in refseq, split over 165 orders and 362 families. changes in the prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline (pgap), which is used to annotate nearly all refseq assemblies include better detection of protein-coding genes. nearly 83% of refseq proteins are now named by a curated protein family model, a 4.7% increase in the past three years ago. in addition to literature citations, enzyme commission numbers, and gene symbols, gene ontology terms are now assigned to 48% of refseq proteins, allowing for easier multi-genome comparison. refseq is found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/. pgap is available as a stand-alone tool able to produce genbank-ready files at https://github.com/ncbi/pgap. graphical abstract",AB_0596
"motivation: the recent development of spatially resolved transcriptomics (srt) technologies has facilitated research on gene expression in the spatial context. annotating cell types is one crucial step for downstream analysis. however, many existing algorithms use an unsupervised strategy to assign cell types for srt data. they first conduct clustering analysis and then aggregate cluster-level expression based on the clustering results. this workflow fails to leverage the marker gene information efficiently. on the other hand, other cell annotation methods designed for single-cell rna-seq data utilize the cell-type marker genes information but fail to use spatial information in srt data. results: we introduce a statistical spatial transcriptomics cell assignment model, span, to annotate clusters of cells or spots into known types in srt data with prior knowledge of predefined marker genes and spatial information. the span model annotates cells or spots from srt data using predefined overexpressed marker genes and combines a mixture model with a hidden markov random field to model the spatial dependency between neighboring spots. we demonstrate the effectiveness of span against spatial and nonspatial clustering algorithms through extensive simulation and real data experiments. availability and implementation: https://github.com/chengz352/span.",AB_0596
