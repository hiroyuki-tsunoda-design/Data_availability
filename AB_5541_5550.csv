"three-dimensional (3d) cell culture is emerging for drug design and drug screening. skin toxicity is one of the most important assays for determining the toxicity of a compound before being used in skin application. much work has been done to find an alternative assay without animal experiments. 3d cell culture is one of the methods that provides clinically relevant models with superior clinical translation compared to that of 2d cell culture. in this study, we developed a spheroid toxicity assay using keratinocyte hacat cells with propidium iodide and calcein am. we also applied the transfer learning-containing convolutional neural network (cnn) to further determine spheroid cell death with fluorescence labeling. our result shows that the morphologies of the spheroid are the key features in determining the apoptosis cell death of the hacat spheroid. our cnn model provided good statistical measurement in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall in both validation and external test data sets. one can predict keratinocyte spheroid cell death if that spheroid image contains the fluorescence signals from propidium iodide and calcein am. the cnn model can be accessed in the web application at https://qsarlabs.com/#spheroiddeath.",AB_0555
"zokors (myospalacinae) continue to be the center of systematics discussions. phylogenetic schemes based on molecular data do not always agree with each other, nor can phylogenetic schemes based on paleontological material be complete due to the only-partial description of west siberian zokors. this paper tries to fill this gap and presents a description of the west siberian lineage from the late early pleistocene to the present, together with an analysis of molar development in other zokor lineages. we describe two new species and one subspecies (myospalax myospalax krukoveri n. ssp., myospalax convexus n. sp., prosiphneus razdoleanensis n. sp.) ancestral to the extant myospalax myospalax laxmann, 1769. we also reveal differences in the ontogeny of molars of modern species that were not previously detailed. these differences, together with paleontological data, indicate that in the west siberian lineage, peramorphosis occurred in the structure of the chewing surface (with the exception of the lower m1), whereas in all other zokor lineages, there was pedomorphosis. on the basis of these results, we suggest a new view on the systematics of myospalacinae.uuid: http://zoobank.org/b06d6c99-1648-454b-9b95-4d869bfe8bdc",AB_0555
"after the biotransformation of xenobiotics in the human body, the biological activity of the metabolites may differ from the activity of parent compounds. therefore, to assess the overall biological activity of a drug-like compound, it is important to take into account its metabolites and their biological activity. we developed metatox 2.0-an updated version of the metatox web application that was able to predict the metabolites of xenobiotics. innovations include estimating the biological activity profile of a compound and taking into account its metabolites. the estimation is based on the pass (prediction of activity spectra for substances) algorithm and on the latest version of the training set covering over 1900 biological activities predicted with an average accuracy exceeding 0.97. also, metatox 2.0 allows the search for similar substances among more than 2000 drugs with known metabolic networks, which were extracted from the chembl, metxbiodb, and drugbank databases. metatox 2.0 is freely available on the web at https://www.way2drug.com/metatox.",AB_0555
"choosing the optimal device during cardiac resynchronization therapy (crt) upgrade can be challenging. therefore, we sought to provide a solution for identifying patients in whom upgrading to a crt-defibrillator (crt-d) is associated with better long-term survival than upgrading to a crt-pacemaker (crt-p). to this end, we first applied topological data analysis to create a patient similarity network using 16 clinical features of 326 patients without prior ventricular arrhythmias who underwent crt upgrade. then, in the generated circular network, we delineated three phenogroups exhibiting significant differences in clinical characteristics and risk of all-cause mortality. importantly, only in the high-risk phenogroup was upgrading to a crt-d associated with better survival than upgrading to a crt-p (hazard ratio: 0.454 (0.228-0.907), p = 0.025). finally, we assigned each patient to one of the three phenogroups based on their location in the network and used this labeled data to train multi-class classifiers to enable the risk stratification of new patients. during internal validation, an ensemble of 5 multi-layer perceptrons exhibited the best performance with a balanced accuracy of 0.898 (0.854-0.942) and a micro-averaged area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.983 (0.980-0.986). to allow further validation, we made the proposed model publicly available (https://github.com/tokmarton/crt-upgrade-risk-stratification).",AB_0555
"a gradual decline in renal function occurs even in healthy aging individuals. in addition to aging, per se, concurrent metabolic syndrome and hypertension, which are common in the aging population, can induce mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation, which collectively contribute to age-related kidney dysfunction and disease. this study examined the role of the nuclear hormone receptors, the estrogen-related receptors (errs), in regulation of age-related mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. the errs were decreased in both aging human and mouse kidneys and were preserved in aging mice with lifelong caloric restriction (cr). a pan-err agonist, slu-pp-332, was used to treat 21-month-old mice for 8 weeks. in addition, 21-month-old mice were treated with a stimulator of interferon genes (sting) inhibitor, c-176, for 3 weeks. remarkably, similar to cr, an 8-week treatment with a pan-err agonist reversed the age-related increases in albuminuria, podocyte loss, mitochondrial dysfunction, and in-flammatory cytokines, via the cyclic gmp-amp synthase-sting and stat3 signaling pathways. a 3-week treatment of 21-month-old mice with a sting inhibitor reversed the increases in inflammatory cytokines and the senescence marker, p21/cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1a (cdkn1a), but also unexpectedly reversed the age-related decreases in pparg coactivator (pgc)-1a, erra, mitochondrial complexes, and medium chain acyl coenzyme a dehydrogenase (mcad) expression. these studies identified errs as cr mimetics and as important modulators of age-related mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. these findings highlight novel druggable pathways that can be further evaluated to prevent progression of age-related kidney disease.

"motivation accurate prediction of change in protein stability due to point mutations is an attractive goal that remains unachieved. despite the high interest in this area, little consideration has been given to the transformer architecture, which is dominant in many fields of machine learning.results in this work, we introduce prostata, a predictive model built in a knowledge-transfer fashion on a new curated dataset. prostata demonstrates advantage over existing solutions based on neural networks. we show that the large improvement margin is due to both the architecture of the model and the quality of the new training dataset. this work opens up opportunities to develop new lightweight and accurate models for protein stability assessment.availability and implementation prostata is available at https://github.com/airi-institute/prostata and https://prostata.airi.net.",AB_0555
"the cancer genome atlas (tcga) and analogous projects have yielded invaluable tumor-associated genomic data. despite several web-based platforms designed to enhance accessibility, certain analyses require prior bioinformatic expertise. to address this need, we developed gene enrichment identifier (geni, https://www.sh aullab.com/geni), which is designed to promptly compute correlations for genes of interest against the entire transcriptome and rank them against well-established biological gene sets. additionally, it generates comprehensive tables containing genes of interest and their corresponding correlation coefficients, presented in publication-quality graphs. furthermore, geni has the capability to analyze multiple genes simultaneously within a given gene set, elucidating their significance within a specific biological context. overall, geni's user-friendly interface simplifies the biological interpretation and analysis of cancer patient-associated data, advancing the understanding of cancer biology and accelerating scientific discoveries.",AB_0555

"dagger serrivomer glehni, a new species of the neogene saw-toothed eel (anguilliformes, serrivomeridae) is described based on the 55 specimens from the middle-upper miocene kurasi formation of sakhalin island, russia. this is the third record of fossil saw-toothed eels since the recovery of partial skeletons from the miocene of japan and italy. the new species demonstrates close similarity to the extant serrivomer species in overall body form and shape of separate bones and their complexes. the new species is characterized by the longidentatus type of vomerine dentition and by a single branchiostegal ray protruding beyond the hyoid bar, which suggests a close affinity to the modern s. sector. it can be reliably distinguished from all other species of serrivomer by its lower number of vertebrae (134 vs. 140-172) and its larger cleithrum, which is positioned under the seventh instead of the eighth vertebral centrum.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:50673e06-602c-4ca1-8cff-ad992bcaebed",AB_0555
