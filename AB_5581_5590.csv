"efficient programs to calculate two-particle oscillator brackets (or talmi-moshinsky-smirnov coefficients) have been constructed recently, comput. phys. comm. 265 (2021) 108005. the corresponding talmi-smirnov transformation is mostly performed in case of particles of equal masses and the constructed programs have been tested in detail as to this case. however, it occurred that those programs included a bug revealing itself in case when particle masses are different. the bug is eliminated in the present version of the programs. all the various tests employed previously at equal masses of particles now reproduce the required results for the case of different masses as well.program summary program title: osbrackets cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /4m594wzv94 .2 licensing provisions: gplv3 programming language: fortran-90 journal reference of previous version: comput. phys. comm. 265 (2021) 108005 does the new version supersede the previous version?: yes reasons for the new version: necessity to fix a bug in the programs which affected the brackets in case of the talmi-smirnov transformation at non equal particle masses. the author is thankful to m.a. sharaf who pointed out the incorrect results pertaining to the previous version of the programs. summary of revisions: the subroutine to calculate the quantity (23) from ref. [1] is corrected. this quantity includes powers of tan & phi; where & phi; is the angle specifying the kinematic rotation. in case of equal mass particles one has | tan & phi;| = 1, see [1]. most applications of the brackets in the literature refer to this case and the previous version of the programs has been tested at | tan & phi;| = 1. however, the mentioned subroutine included a bug that reveals itself in the | tan & phi;| =1 case. in the present version of the programs, the bug is eliminated. all the various tests described in [1] now reproduce the required results also at | tan & phi;| =1, i.e., at arbitrary mass ratio of particles. nature of problem: single-particle basis oscillator states are widely used for studying the structure of various many-body systems. to compute matrix elements of two-body operators, the talmi-smirnov transformation of oscillator states is performed. coefficients of this transformation are called oscillator brackets. often it is necessary to retain large sets of basis oscillator states in calculations. therefore, a fast program to compute the brackets is needed. the program should provide accurate results up to high oscillator excitations. solution method: at zero radial quantum numbers, oscillator brackets are calculated using an explicit expression that includes few summations. starting from such brackets, recurrence relations are employed to calculate the brackets of the general type. these relations prove to work perfectly up to very high oscillator excitations. & copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0559
"we introduce mcdaps, an interactive software for assessing autonomic imbalance from non-invasive multi-channel physiological recordings. mcdaps provides a graphical user interface for data visualization, beat-to-beat processing and interactive analyses. the software extracts beat-to-beat rr interval systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, the pulse amplitude of photoplethysmogram and the pulse-to-pulse interval. the analysis modules include stationary and time-varying power spectral analyses, moving-correlation analysis and univariate analyses. analyses can also be performed in batch mode if multiple datasets have to be processed in the same way. the program exports results in standard csv format. mcdaps runs in matlab, and is supported on ms windows and mac os systems. the matlab source code is available at https://github.com/thuptimd/mcdaps.git. & copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0559
"sheet metal (sm) fabrication is perhaps one of the most common metal-working technique. despite its prevalence, sm design is manual and costly, with rigorous practices that restrict the search space, yielding suboptimal results. in contrast, we present a framework for the first automatic design of sm parts. focusing on load bearing applications, our novel system generates a high-performing manufacturable sm that adheres to the numerous constraints that sm design entails: the resulting part minimizes manufacturing costs while adhering to structural, spatial, and manufacturing constraints. in other words, the part should be strong enough, not disturb the environment, and adhere to the manufacturing process. these desiderata sum up to an elaborate, sparse, and expensive search space. our generative approach is a carefully designed exploration process, comprising two steps. in segment discovery connections from the input load to attachable regions are accumulated, and during segment composition the most performing valid combination is searched for. for discovery, we define a slim grammar, and sample it for parts using a markov-chain monte carlo (mcmc) approach, ran in intercommunicating instances (i.e, chains) for diversity. this, followed by a short continuous optimization, enables building a diverse and high-quality library of substructures. during composition, a valid and minimal cost combination of the curated substructures is selected. to improve compliance significantly without additional manufacturing costs, we reinforce candidate parts onto themselves - a unique sm capability called self-riveting. we provide our code and data in https://github.com/amir90/autosheetmetal. we show our generative approach produces viable parts for numerous scenarios. we compare our system against a human expert and observe improvements in both part quality and design time. we further analyze our pipeline's steps with respect to resulting quality, and have fabricated some results for validation. we hope our system will stretch the field of sm design, replacing costly expert hours with minutes of standard cpu, making this cheap and reliable manufacturing method accessible to anyone.",AB_0559
"recent text-to-image generative models have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to generate diverse and creative imagery guided by a target text prompt. while revolutionary, current state-of-the-art diffusion models may still fail in generating images that fully convey the semantics in the given text prompt. we analyze the publicly available stable diffusion model and assess the existence of catastrophic neglect, where the model fails to generate one or more of the subjects from the input prompt. moreover, we find that in some cases the model also fails to correctly bind attributes (e.g., colors) to their corresponding subjects. to help mitigate these failure cases, we introduce the concept of generative semantic nursing (gsn), where we seek to intervene in the generative process on the fly during inference time to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. using an attention-based formulation of gsn, dubbed attend-and-excite, we guide the model to refine the cross-attention units to attend to all subject tokens in the text prompt and strengthen - or excite - their activations, encouraging the model to generate all subjects described in the text prompt. we compare our approach to alternative approaches and demonstrate that it conveys the desired concepts more faithfully across a range of text prompts. code is available at our project page: https://attendandexcite.github.io/attend-and-excite/.",AB_0559
"motivation biomarker discovery is one of the most frequent pursuits in bioinformatics and is crucial for precision medicine, disease prognosis, and drug discovery. a common challenge of biomarker discovery applications is the low ratio of samples over features for the selection of a reliable not-redundant subset of features, but despite the development of efficient tree-based classification methods, such as the extreme gradient boosting (xgboost), this limitation is still relevant. moreover, existing approaches for optimizing xgboost do not deal effectively with the class imbalance nature of the biomarker discovery problems, and the presence of multiple conflicting objectives, since they focus on the training of a single-objective model. in the current work, we introduce meva-x, a novel hybrid ensemble for feature selection (fs) and classification, combining a niche-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (ea) with the xgboost classifier. meva-x deploys a multiobjective ea to optimize the hyperparameters of the classifier and perform fs, identifying a set of pareto-optimal solutions and optimizing multiple objectives, including classification and model simplicity metrics. results the performance of the meva-x tool was benchmarked using one omics dataset coming from a microarray gene expression experiment, and one clinical questionnaire-based dataset combined with demographic information. meva-x tool outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in the balanced categorization of classes, creating multiple low-complexity models and identifying important nonredundant biomarkers. the best-performing run of meva-x for the prediction of weight loss using gene expression data yields a small set of blood circulatory markers which are sufficient for this precision nutrition application but need further validation. availability and implementation https://github.com/pankonstantinos/meva-x.",AB_0559
"short tandem repeats (strs) are short repeated sequences commonly found in the human genome and valuable in forensic science, used for human identity and relatedness markers. next-generation sequencing (ngs) technologies, e.g., forenseq signature prep, can sequence strs, inferring length-based alleles and single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) and providing valuable insights into population and sub-population structures. despite the potential benefits of ngs for strs, no open-source software platform integrates the collection, management, and analysis of str data from ngs into one place. users must use multiple programs to process their str data and then collect the results into a separate database or a file system folder. moreover, analyzing repeat structures (str repeat motifs) may require learning multiple software tools, making the process inefficient and cumbersome. to address this gap, we introduce the strategy, a standalone web-based application supporting essential str data management and analysis capabilities. the strategy allows users to collect their data into its database, automatically calculates forensic parameters, and visualizes the analyzed data in various forms. users can search the database using different options, such as by profile, loci, and genotypes, with and without a specific test kit. moreover, users can also find the nucleotide variants of a locus among the samples. we designed the strategy for internal use in a laboratory or an organization. hence, our system includes role-based access control that allows users to search for or access specific data based on their responsibilities. the administrator role can customize the system, for example, configure maps according to the samples' geographic data, and manage reference str repeat motifs. a laboratory or an organization can download and install a copy of strategy on their local system using docker, as described in https://github.com/cucpbioinfo/strategy. in summary, the strategy is an end-to-end system that provides users with a database to collect the analyzed str data from ngs, the dynamic analyses of forensic parameters, and the variants of str patterns according to the newly added samples, which are then explorable via various search options and visualizations. the system is helpful for both forensic investigations and forensic genetics.",AB_0559
"voro++ is a software library written in c++ for computing the voronoi tessellation, a technique in computational geometry that is widely used for analyzing systems of particles. voro++ was released in 2009 and is based on computing the voronoi cell for each particle individually. here, we take advantage of modern computer hardware, and extend the original serial version to allow for multithreaded computation of voronoi cells via the openmp application programming interface. we test the performance of the code, and demonstrate that it can achieve parallel efficiencies greater than 95% in many cases. the multithreaded extension follows standard openmp programming paradigms, allowing it to be incorporated into other programs. we provide an example of this using the vorotop software library, performing a multithreaded voronoi cell topology analysis of up to 102.4 million particles.program summaryprogram title: voro++cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /tddc4w4zkk.1developer's repository link: https://github .com /chr1shr /voro licensing provisions: bsd 3-clause (with lbnl modification) programming language: c++external routines/libraries: openmpnature of problem: multithreaded computation of the voronoi tessellation in two and three dimensions solution method: the voro++ library is built around several c++ classes that can be incorporated into other programs. the two largest components are the container... classes that spatially sort input particles into a grid-based data structure, allowing for efficient searches of nearby particles, and the voronoicell... classes that represent a single voronoi cell as an arbitrary convex polygon or polyhedron. the voronoi cell for each particle is built by considering a sequence of plane cuts based on neighboring particles, after which many different statistics (e.g. volume, centroid, number of vertices) can be computed. since each voronoi cell is calculated individually, the voronoi cells can be computed using multithreading via openmp.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0559
"the effect of processing conditions on handling and storage stability of spray dried sar-dine protein hydrolysates (sph) was determined based on equilibrium moisture content (xe), glass transition temperature (tg) and surface morphology. sph with a degree of hy-drolysis (dh) of 38.7% and 76.4%, and 0%, 15% and 30% (w/w dry solids) maltodextrin concentration were spray dried at an inlet air temperature of 180 & deg;c and 220 & deg;c and then stored under controlled atmospheric water activity (aw) ranging from 0.113 to 0.843 for a period of 21 days. the powders had high equilibrium moisture content (0.393 - 0.715 g h2o/g dry powder) at 0.843 aw, with high dh producing powders with high xe (> 0.645 g h2o/g dry powder). dh also had a strong effect on tg, which ranged from - 27.5-50.3 & deg;c for powders stored at 0.113 and 0.328 aw, while spray drying temperature had the least effect. addition of maltodextrin only improved storage properties at aw above 0.529 by lowering xe and particle size (< 20 & mu;m). this has implications on powder handling where water activity can be controlled to below 0.529 to avoid the diluting effect of maltodextrin on protein content when it is not required as part of the food formulation. these results show the variable effects that process conditions have on powder properties and the need to consider handling and storage separately. & copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd on behalf of institution of chemical engineers. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://creati-vecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0559
"introduction: until recently no major epidemiological research of primary hyperparathyroidism (phpt) has been conducted in the russian federation, this led to the creation of the russian online registry. the objective of this study is to estimate the clinical and biochemical profile, classical and non-classical complications, surgical intervention and medical therapy of the patients with different forms of phpt in the russian federation. materials and methods: the cross-sectional, observational, continuous study was conducted at the endocrinology research centre (moscow). the present study explored retrospective data from 6003 patients submitted to the registry between 12.12.2016 and 25.10.2022 from 81 regions of the russian federation (http://pgpt.clin-reg.ru/). results: the median age was 59 [60; 66] years with a female:male ratio of 11.7:1. symptomatic phpt was observed in 74.3% while asymptomatic form - only in 25.7% of cases. bone pathology was the predominant clinical manifestation in 62.5% of cases (n=2293), mostly in combination with visceral complications 45.7% (n=1676). the majority of patients (63.3%) had combined visceral disorders including kidney damage in 51.8% and gastroduodenal erosions/ulcers in 32.3% of patients. symptomatic patients were older (60 [53; 67] vs. 54 [45; 62] years, p < 0.001) and had more severe biochemical alterations of calcium-phosphorus metabolism. cardiovascular disease (.vd) was recorded in 48% of patients, among them the most frequent was arterial hypertension (up to 93.9%). a genetic test was conducted in 183 cases (suspicious for hereditary phpt) revealing the mutations in men1, cdc73, ret genes in 107, 6 and 2 cases, respectively. surgery was performed in 53.4% of patients with remission achievement in 87%, the relapse/persistence were recorded in 13% of cases. histological examination revealed carcinoma in 4%, atypical adenoma in 2%, adenoma in 84% and hyperplasia in 11% of cases. drug therapy was prescribed in 54.0% of cases, most often cholecalciferol. conclusion: the detection rate of phpt has increased in the russian federation in recent years. this increase is associated with the start of online registration.however, the majority of patients remain symptomatic with significant alterations of phosphorus-calcium metabolism that indicates delayed diagnosis and requires further modifications of medical care.",AB_0559
