"integration of heterogeneous single-cell sequencing datasets generated across multiple tissue locations, time, and conditions is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the cellular states and expression programs underlying complex biological systems. here, we present scdreamer (https://github.com/zafar-lab/scdreamer), a data-integration framework that employs deep generative models and adversarial training for both unsupervised and supervised (scdreamer-sup) integration of multiple batches. using six real benchmarking datasets, we demonstrate that scdreamer can overcome critical challenges including skewed cell type distribution among batches, nested batch-effects, large number of batches and conservation of development trajectory across batches. our experiments also show that scdreamer and scdreamer-sup outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised integration methods respectively in batch-correction and conservation of biological variation. using a 1 million cells dataset, we demonstrate that scdreamer is scalable and can perform atlas-level cross-species (e.g., human and mouse) integration while being faster than other deep-learning-based methods.",AB_0506
"understanding the development of humoral immune responses of children and adolescents to sars-cov-2 is essential for designing effective public health measures. here we examine the changes of humoral immune response in school-aged children and adolescents during the covid-19 pandemic (june 2020 to july 2022), with a specific interest in the omicron variant (beginning of 2022). in our study ciao corona, we assess in each of the five testing rounds between 1874 and 2500 children and adolescents from 55 schools in the canton of zurich with a particular focus on a longitudinal cohort (n=751). by july 2022, 96.9% (95% credible interval 95.3-98.1%) of children and adolescents have sars-cov-2 anti-spike igg (s-igg) antibodies. those with hybrid immunity or vaccination have higher s-igg titres and stronger neutralising responses against wildtype, delta and omicron ba.1 variants compared to those infected but unvaccinated. s-igg persist over 18 months in 93% of children and adolescents. during the study period one adolescent was hospitalised for less than 24 hours possibly related to an acute sars-cov-2 infection. these findings show that the omicron wave and the rollout of vaccines boosted s-igg titres and neutralising capacity. trial registration number: nct04448717. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04448717.",AB_0506
"the pro-inflammatory and regulatory roles of t lymphocytes in atherosclerosis are well established but less is known about natural killer (nk) cells and natural killer t (nkt)-like cells. the effects of cardiovascular risk management on the phenotypes of these cells are unknown. to assess changes in nk cell and lymphocyte phenotypes and circulating inflammatory proteins in response to cardiovascular risk management in patients with carotid atherosclerosis. fifty patients were included in a prospective clinical study. measurements were at baseline and after 12 months of cardiovascular risk management. circulating nk, nkt-like and t lymphocyte subpopulations were phenotyped by multi-colour flow cytometry. proximity extension assay was performed for 176 plasma proteins associated with inflammation and cardiovascular disease. at 12 months there were significant reductions in ldl (p=0.001) and blood pressure (p=0.028). nk cells responded with a reduction in pro-inflammatory (nkg2c(+)) cells (p=0.0003), an increase in anti-inflammatory (nkg2a(+)) cells (p=0.032), and a reduction in terminally differentiated (cd57(+)) nk cells. nkt-like cells showed a similar decrease in terminally differentiated subpopulations (p=0.000002). subpopulations of t helper cells exhibited a significant reduction in central memory (p=1.09x10(-8)) and a significant increase in cd4(+) naive- (p=0.0008) and effector memory t cells (p=0.006). the protein analysis indicated that cardiovascular risk management affects proteins involved in the inflammatory nf-kappa b pathway. the consistent decrease in senescent phenotypes of nk, nkt-like and cd4(+) cells with a concomitant increase in more naive, phenotypes suggests a change towards a less pro-inflammatory lymphocyte profile in response to cardiovascular risk management.trial registry name: carotid mri of atherosclerosis (carma). clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct04835571 (08/04/2021). https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/nct04835571.",AB_0506
"background recombination reshuffles alleles at linked loci, allowing genes to evolve independently and consequently enhancing the efficiency of selection. this makes quantifying recombination along chromosomes an important goal for understanding how selection and drift are acting on genes and chromosomes.results we present recview, an interactive r application and its homonymous r package, to facilitate locating recombination positions along chromosomes or scaffolds using whole-genome genotype data of a three-generation pedigree. recview analyses and plots the grandparent-of-origin of all informative alleles along each chromosome of the offspring in the pedigree, and infers recombination positions with either of two built-in algorithms: one based on change in the proportion of the alleles with specific grandparent-of-origin, and one on the degree of continuity of alleles with the same grandparent-of-origin. recview handles multiple offspring and chromosomes simultaneously, and all putative recombination positions are reported in base pairs together with an estimated precision based on the local density of informative alleles. we demonstrate recview using genotype data of a passerine bird with an available reference genome, the great reed warbler (acrocephalus arundinaceus), and show that recombination events can be located to specific positions.conclusions recview is an easy-to-use and highly effective application for locating recombination positions with high precision. recview is available on github (https://github.com/hkylezhang/recview.git).",AB_0506
"leptoquarks are theoretically well-motivated and have received increasing attention in recent years as they can explain several hints for physics beyond the standard model. in this article, we calculate the renormalisation group evolution of models with scalar leptoquarks. we compute the anomalous dimensions for all couplings (gauge, yukawa, higgs and leptoquarks interactions) of the most general lagrangian at the two-loop level and the corresponding threshold corrections at one-loop. the most relevant analytic results are presented in the appendix, while the notebook containing the full expressions can be downloaded at https://github.com/sumitbanikgit/slq-rg. in our phenomenological analysis, we consider some exemplary cases with focus on gauge and yukawa coupling unification.",AB_0506
"motivation fungal pathogens are known to cause life threatening invasive infections with rising global mortality rates. besides, the indiscriminate use of antifungals in both clinics and agriculture has promoted antifungal drug resistance in the last decade. fungi can show drug resistance by a variety of mechanisms. but primary driver in all these hitherto documented mechanisms is stable and heritable point mutations in the key proteins. therefore, cataloguing mutations that can confer resistance is the first step toward understanding the mechanisms leading to the emergence of antifungal resistance.results in the present, work we have described a database of all the mutations responsible for antifungal resistance. named as antifungal resistance database (afrbase), it is better than the existing databases of antifungal resistance namely, funresdb and mardy which have a limited scope and inadequate information. data of afrbase was collected using both text mining and manual curation. afrbase provides a separate window for visualization of mutations in the 2d and 3d formats making it easy for researchers to analyze the mutation data and ensures interoperability with other standard molecular biology databases like ncbi and uniprotkb. we hope afrbase can be useful to both clinicians and basic biomedical scientists as we envision it as an important resource for genotypic susceptibility testing of fungi and to study/predict the course of evolution of antifungal resistance. the current version of afrbase contains manually curated 3691 unique mutations present in 29 proteins of 32 fungal species along with the information of drugs against which resistance is caused.availability and implementation afrbase is an open access database available at http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/afrbase/.",AB_0506
"preventing relapse into violence and its destructive consequences among persistent re-offenders is a primary concern in forensic settings. the risk-need-responsivity framework models the best current practice for offender treatment, focused on building skills and changing pro-criminal cognitions. however, treatment effects are often modest, and the forensic context can obstruct the delivery of interventions. developing treatments for offenders should focus on the best method of delivery to make what works work. virtual reality (vr)-assisted treatments such as virtual reality aggression prevention training (vrapt) are a new and innovative approach to offender treatment. this pilot study followed 14 male violent offenders who participated in vrapt in a swedish prison context and measured changes from pre-treatment to post-treatment and 3-month follow-up in targeted aggression, emotion regulation, and anger. it also investigated potential impact factors (pro-criminal cognitions, externalizing behaviors, psychosocial background, and childhood adverse experiences). in bayesian linear mixed effects models, participants showed a high probability of change from pre-treatment to post-treatment and to follow-up on all outcome measures. all outcome measures demonstrated a low probability of change from post-treatment to follow-up. analysis of reliable change showed that participants' results ranged from recovery to deterioration. we discuss the implications of the study for vrapt's impact on the target group, those who might benefit from the approach, and suggested foci for future studies in the field of vr-assisted offender treatment. the study was preregistered at the international standard randomized controlled trial number registry (https://doi.org/10.1186/isrctn14916410).",AB_0506
"the capability to comprehend the intention of pedestrians on the road is one of the most crucial skills that the current autonomous vehicles (avs) are striving for, to become fully autonomous. in recent years, multi-modal methods have gained traction employing trajectory, appearance, and context for predicting pedestrian crossing intention. however, most existing research works still lag rich feature representational ability in a multimodal scenario, restricting their performance. moreover, less emphasis is put on pedestrian interactions with the surroundings for predicting short-term pedestrian intention in a challenging ego-centric vision. to address these challenges, an efficient visual-motion-interaction-guided (vmi) intention prediction framework has been proposed. this framework comprises visual encoder (ve), motion encoder (me), and interaction encoder (ie) to capture rich multimodal features of the pedestrian and its interactions with the surroundings, followed by temporal attention and adaptive fusion (af) module (afm) to integrate these multimodal features efficiently. the proposed framework outperforms several sota on benchmark datasets: pedestrian intention estimation (pie)/joint attention in autonomous driving (jaad) with accuracy, auc, f1-score, precision, and recall as 0.92/0.89, 0.91/0.90, 0.87/0.81, 0.86/0.79, and 0.88/0.83, respectively. furthermore, extensive experiments are carried out to investigate different fusion architectures and design parameters of all encoders. the proposed vmi framework predicts pedestrian crossing intention 2.5 s ahead of the crossing event. code is available at: https://github.com/neha013/vmi.git.",AB_0506
"in this update paper, we present the latest developments in the oma browser knowledgebase, which aims to provide high-quality orthology inferences and facilitate the study of gene families, genomes and their evolution. first, we discuss the addition of new species in the database, particularly an expanded representation of prokaryotic species. the oma browser now offers ancestral genome pages and an ancestral gene order viewer, allowing users to explore the evolutionary history and gene content of ancestral genomes. we also introduce a revamped local synteny viewer to compare genomic neighborhoods across both extant and ancestral genomes. hierarchical orthologous groups (hogs) are now annotated with gene ontology annotations, and users can easily perform extant or ancestral go enrichments. finally, we recap new tools in the oma ecosystem, including omamer for proteome mapping, omark for proteome quality assessment, omamo for model organism selection and read2tree for phylogenetic species tree construction from reads. these new features provide exciting opportunities for orthology analysis and comparative genomics. oma is accessible at https://omabrowser.org. graphical abstract",AB_0506
"backgroundplacenta accreta spectrum (pas) disorders have been reported with an increasing frequency of up to 3%. the increase in the incidence can be explained by the rising rate of caesarean section (cs), assisted reproductive technology (art) and previous uterine surgeries. pas disorders are usually associated with postpartum haemorrhage (pph). in our study, we investigated the risk factors for increased blood loss in women with histologically verified pas disorders independent of delivery mode.methodsin a retrospective single-centre cross-sectional study, 2,223 pregnant women with histologically verified pas disorders were included. risk factors for pph in women with pas disorders were examined and compared between women with pph (study group; n = 879) and women with normal blood loss (control group; n = 1150), independent of delivery mode. pas disorders were diagnosed histologically from the following specimens: placenta, placental-bed specimens, uterine curettage, uterine resection and/or total/partial hysterectomy. medical data were extracted from clinical records of pregnant women with pas disorders delivering at the university hospital basel between 1986 and 2019. the placenta data of women with pas disorders were obtained and identified through a search from the database of the department of pathology, university hospital basel.resultsbetween 1986 and 2019, there were 64,472 deliveries at the university hospital basel. pas disorders were histologically verified in 2,223 women (2,223/64,472), and the prevalence of pas disorders was 3.45%. a total of 879 women with pas disorders showed pph, independent of delivery mode (43.3%). due to missing data for 194 women, the final analysis was conducted with the remaining 2,029 women. placenta praevia (o.r. = 6.087; 95% ci, 3.813 to 9.778), previous endometritis (o.r. = 3.011; 95% ci, 1.060 to 9.018), previous manual placenta removal (o.r. = 2.530; 95% ci, 1.700 to 3.796), art (o.r. = 2.169; 95% ci, 1.593 to 2.960) and vaginal operative birth (o.r. = 1.715; 95% ci, 1.225-2.428) can be considered important risk factors, and previous cs (o.r. = 1.408; 95% ci, 1.016 to 1.950) can be considered a moderate potential risk factor of pph in women with pas disorders.conclusionsplacenta praevia, previous endometritis, previous placenta removal, art and vaginal operative birth can be considered important risk factors of pph in women with pas disorders.study registrationthe study was registered under http://www.clinicaltrials.gov (nct05542043) on 15 september 2022.",AB_0506
