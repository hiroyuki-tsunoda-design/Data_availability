"rice is the staple food for approximately half of the world's population. seed vigour has a crucial impact on the yield, which can be evaluated by germination rate, vigor index and etc. existing seed vigour testing methods heavily rely on manual inspections that are destructive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. to address the drawbacks of existing rice seed vigour testing, we proposed a multispectral image-based non-destructive seed germination testing approach. specifically, we collected multispectral data in 19 wavebands for six rice varieties. furthermore, we designed an end-to-end pipeline, denoted as msiformer (misformer cod3e will be available at https://github.com/liaoyun0x0/misformer) by integrating a yolo-based object detector (trained yolo v5) and a vision transformer-based vigour testing model, which effectively improved the automation and efficiency of existing techniques. in order to objectively evaluate the performance of the proposed method in this paper, we conduct a comparison between misformer and other 3 deep learning methods. the results showed that, misformer performed much better with the accuracy of 94.17%, which was 2.5%-18.34% higher than the other 3 deep learning methods. besides msiformer, possibilities of cielab mediated image analysis of ttc (tetrazolium chloride) staining in rice seed viability and ncda (normalized canonical discriminant analysis) in rice seed vigour were also discussed, where cielab l* of ttc staining were negatively correlated with vigor index and germination rate, with pearson's correlation coefficient of -0.9874, -0.9802 respectively, and cielab a* of ttc staining were and positively correlated with vigor index and germination rate, with pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.9624, 0.9544 respectively, and cielab a* of ncda had pearson's correlation coefficient of -0.8866 and -0.9340 with vigor index and germination rate, respectively. besides testing methods, vigour results within and among variety(ies) showed that, there were great variations among the 6 rice varieties, and mean coefficient of variation (cv) of vigor index of individual seed within a variety reached 64.87%, revealing the high risk of conventional methods in random sampling. vigour variations had close relationship with wavelengths of 780 nm-970 nm, indicating their value in future research.",AB_0228
"background: while immunosuppressive regimens have improved outcomes in solid organ trans-plantation, non-immune factors have also been identified as contributors to graft prognosis. age, gender, hormones, heredity, and other diseases have been recognized to affect organ trans-plantation. however, the causal relationship between blood lipids and graft dysfunction remains unverified in human clinical investigations. in this study, we employed two-sample mendelian randomization (mr) to examine the causality between different types of blood lipids and graft dysfunction following organ and tissue transplantation.methods: we conducted a two-sample mr study using available genome-wide association summary data from the online database mrbase (http://app.mrbase.org/), which encompasses over 11 billion associations between genetic factors and health-related outcomes, enabling researchers to explore various potential determinants of poor health. the exposure factors included four types of blood lipids: high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, cholesterol, and triglycerides. for each exposure factor, three databases were selected for analysis. the outcome factor was the failure and rejection of transplanted organs and tissues. all databases consisted of european population samples, without specific subgroups. the related studies were conducted between 2016 and 2022, and the twosamplemr r package was employed for variant selection.results: a total of 13 sample groups were collected and analyzed. the results revealed a causal association between blood lipids and graft dysfunction following organ and tissue trans-plantation. specifically, the two-sample mr analysis confirmed that low-density lipoprotein and cholesterol levels were significant risk factors for increased graft dysfunction risk after trans-plantation. moreover, high-density lipoprotein potentially reduced the risk of allograft dysfunction, while triglycerides possibly elevated the risk. conclusions: our recent study provides the initial confirmation that blood lipids may initiate causal pathological processes leading to graft dysfunction after organ and tissue transplantation.",AB_0228
"carcinoma of unknown primary (cup) is a type of metastatic cancer with tissue-of-origin (too) unidentifiable by traditional methods. cup patients typically have poor prognosis but therapy targeting the original cancer tissue can significantly improve patients' prognosis. thus, it's critical to develop accurate computational methods to infer cancer too. while qpcr or microarray-based methods are effective in inferring too for most cancer types, the overall prediction accuracy is yet to be improved. in this study, we propose a cross-cohort computational framework to trace too of 32 cancer types based on rna sequencing (rna-seq). specifically, we employed logistic regression models to select 80 genes for each cancer type to create a combined 1356-gene set, based on transcriptomic data from 9911 tissue samples covering the 32 cancer types with known too from the cancer genome atlas (tcga). the selected genes are enriched in both tissue-specific and tissue-general functions. the cross-validation accuracy of our framework reaches 97.50% across all cancer types. furthermore, we tested the performance of our model on the tcga metastatic dataset and international cancer genome consortium (icgc) dataset, achieving an accuracy of 91.09% and 82.67%, respectively, despite the differences in experiment procedures and pipelines. in conclusion, we developed an accurate yet robust computational framework for identifying too, which holds promise for clinical applications. our code is available at http://github.com/wangbo00129/classifybysklearn.",AB_0228
"pneumothorax is a condition involving a collapsed lung, which requires accurate segmentation of computed tomography (ct) images for effective clinical decision-making. numerous convolutional neural network-based methods for medical image segmentation have been proposed, but they often struggle to balance model complexity with performance. to address this, we introduce the efficient feature alignment network (efa-net), a novel medical image segmentation network designed specifically for pneumothorax ct segmentation. efa-net uses efficientnet as an encoder to extract features and a feature alignment (fa) module as a decoder to align features in both the spatial and channel dimensions. this design allows efa-net to achieve superior segmentation performance with reduced model complexity. in our dataset, our method outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, achieving a dice coefficient of 90.03%, an intersection over union (iou) of 81.80%, and a sensitivity of 88.94%. notably, efa-net has significantly lower flops (1.549g) and parameters (0.432m), offering better robustness and facilitating easier deployment. future work will explore the integration of downstream applications to enhance efa-net's utility for clinicians and patients in real-world diagnostic scenarios. the source code of efa-net is available at: https://github.com/tianjiamutangchun/efa-net.",AB_0228

"protein-ligand interaction (pli) is a critical step for drug discovery. recently, protein pretrained language models (plms) have showcased exceptional performance across a wide range of protein-related tasks. however, a significant heterogeneity exists between the plm and pli tasks, leading to a degree of uncertainty. in this study, we propose a method that quantitatively assesses the significance of protein plms in pli prediction. specifically, we analyze the performance of three widely-used protein plms (tape, esm-1b, and prottrans) on three pli tasks (pdbbind, kinase, and dud-e). the model with pre-training consistently achieves improved performance and decreased time cost, demonstrating that enhance both the accuracy and efficiency of pli prediction. by quantitatively assessing the transferability, the optimal plm for each pli task is identified without the need for costly transfer experiments. additionally, we examine the contributions of plms on the distribution of feature space, highlighting the improved discriminability after pre-training. our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying plms in pli prediction and pave the way for the design of more interpretable and accurate plms in the future. code and data are freely available at https://github.com/brian-zzz/plm-pli.",AB_0228
"motivation since the development of single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) technologies, clustering analysis of single-cell gene expression data has been an essential tool for distinguishing cell types and identifying novel cell types. even though many methods have been available for scrna-seq clustering analysis, the majority of them are constrained by the requirement on predetermined cluster numbers or the dependence on selected initial cluster assignment.results in this article, we propose an adaptive embedding and clustering method named scace, which constructs a variational autoencoder to simultaneously learn cell embeddings and cluster assignments. in the scace method, we develop an adaptive cluster merging approach which achieves improved clustering results without the need to estimate the number of clusters in advance. in addition, scace provides an option to perform clustering enhancement, which can update and enhance cluster assignments based on previous clustering results from other methods. based on computational analysis of both simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that scace outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods for scrna-seq data, and achieves better clustering accuracy and robustness.availability and implementation the scace package is implemented in python 3.8 and is freely available from https://github.com/sldyns/scace.",AB_0228
"in this work, we address the task of tumor cellularity (tc) estimation with a novel framework based on the label distribution learning (ldl) paradigm. we propose a self-ensemble label distribution learning framework (sldl) to resolve the challenges of existing ldl-based methods, including difficulties for inter-rater ambiguity exploitation, proper and flexible label distribution generation, and accurate tc value recovery. the proposed sldl makes four main contributions which have been demonstrated to be quite effective in numerous experiments. first, we propose an expertness-aware conditional vae for diversified single-rater modeling and an attention-based multi-rater fusion strategy that enables effective inter-rater ambiguity exploitation. second, we propose a template-based label distribution generation method that is tailored for the tc estimation task and constructs label distributions based on the annotation priors. third, we propose a novel restricted distribution loss, significantly improving the tc value estimation by effectively regularizing the learning with unimodal loss and regression loss. fourth, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to simultaneously leverage inter-rater and intra-rater variability to address the label ambiguity issue in the breast tumor cellularity estimation tasks. the experimental results on the public breastpathq dataset demonstrate that the sldl outperforms the existing methods by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art results in the tc estimation task. the code will be available from https://github.com/perceptioncomputinglab/ultra.",AB_0228
"cross-domain object detection is a key problem in the research of intelligent detection models. different from lots of improved algorithms based on two-stage detection models, we try another way. a simple and efficient one-stage model is introduced in this paper, comprehensively considering the inference efficiency and detection precision, and expanding the scope of undertaking cross-domain object detection problems. we name this gradient reverse layer-based model yolo-g, which greatly improves the object detection precision in cross-domain scenarios. specifically, we add a feature alignment branch following the backbone, where the gradient reverse layer and a classifier are attached. with only a small increase in computational, the performance is higher enhanced. experiments such as cityscapes & rarr;foggy cityscapes, sim10k & rarr;cityscape, pascal voc & rarr;clipart, and so on, indicate that compared with most state-of-the-art (sota) algorithms, the proposed model achieves much better mean average precision (map). furthermore, ablation experiments were also performed on 4 components to confirm the reliability of the model. the project is available at https://github.com/airy975924806/yolo-g.",AB_0228
"accurate prognostic prediction is crucial for treatment decision-making in lung papillary adenocarcinoma (lpadc). the aim of this study was to predict cancer-specific survival in lpadc using ensemble machine learning and classical cox regression models. moreover, models were evaluated to provide recommendations based on quantitative data for personalized treatment of lpadc. data of patients diagnosed with lpadc (2004-2018) were extracted from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database. the set of samples was randomly divided into the training and validation sets at a ratio of 7:3. three ensemble models were selected, namely gradient boosting survival (gbs), random survival forest (rsf), and extra survival trees (est). in addition, cox proportional hazards (coxph) regression was used to construct the prognostic models. the harrell's concordance index (c-index), integrated brier score (ibs), and area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (time-dependent auc) were used to evaluate the performance of the predictive models. a user-friendly web access panel was provided to easily evaluate the model for the prediction of survival and treatment recommendations. a total of 3615 patients were randomly divided into the training and validation cohorts (n = 2530 and 1085, respectively). the extra survival trees, rsf, gbs, and coxph models showed good discriminative ability and calibration in both the training and validation cohorts (mean of time-dependent auc: > 0.84 and > 0.82; c-index: > 0.79 and > 0.77; ibs: < 0.16 and < 0.17, respectively). the rsf and gbs models were more consistent than the coxph model in predicting long-term survival. we implemented the developed models as web applications for deployment into clinical practice (accessible through https://shinyshine-820-lpaprediction-model-z3ubbu.streamlit.app/). all four prognostic models showed good discriminative ability and calibration. the rsf and gbs models exhibited the highest effectiveness among all models in predicting the long-term cancer-specific survival of patients with lpadc. this approach may facilitate the development of personalized treatment plans and prediction of prognosis for lpadc.",AB_0228
