"objective sagittal craniosynostosis (sc) is the most commonly encountered form of craniosynostosis. despite its relative frequency, there remains significant heterogeneity in both operative management and follow-up between centers and a relative paucity of long-term outcome data in the literature. at the authors' institution, families of children presenting with sc are offered the following options: 1) conservative management with ophthalmic surveillance, 2) minimally invasive surgery at < 6 months of age (spring-assisted cranioplasty [sac]) or 3) calvarial vault remodeling at any age (cvr). the authors reviewed outcomes for all children presenting with sc during a 5-year period, regardless of the treatment received.methods consecutive children born between january 1, 2008, and december 31, 2012, presenting with sc were identified, and detailed chart reviews were undertaken. demographic, surgical, perioperative, head shape, scar, and neurodevelopmental (behavioral, education, speech, and language) data were analyzed. the cohort was divided by type of surgery (none, sac, or cvr) and by age at surgery (early, defined as <= 6 months; or late, defined as > 6 months) for comparison purposes.results a total of 167 children were identified, 129 boys and 38 girls, with a median age at presentation of 5.0 (range 0.4-135) months. three families opted for conservative management. of the 164 children who underwent surgery, 83 underwent sac, 76 underwent cvr, and 5 underwent a hybrid procedure (cvr with springs). at a median age of 7.0 (range 0.5-12.3) years, there was no significant difference in concerns regarding head shape, scar, or neurodevelopmental outcomes between the early and late intervention groups over all procedures performed, or between the early or late sac and cvr cohorts. there were more head shape concerns in the sac group than in the cvr group overall (25.7% vs 11.8%, respectively; p = 0.026), although most of these concerns were minor and did not require revision.conclusions in this cohort, regardless of operative intervention and timing of intervention, infants achieved similar neurodevelopmental outcomes. minimally invasive surgery (sac) appears to result in less complete correction of head shape than cvr, but this may be balanced by advantages in reduced operative time, hospitalization, and blood loss. sac was equal to cvr in neuropsychological outcomes.https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.10.peds22135",AB_0449
"a key step in the manufacture of numerous high-performance products with nano-particles in their formulation requires process intensification to achieve the deagglo-meration of particle clusters and generate a fine dispersion. concentrated dispersions as master batches offer several advantages and at the same time challenges due to the re-sulting complex rheology. this study, performed using an ultrasonicator as the energy intensive device, aimed at addressing the challenges relating to dispersion rheology re-sulting from increased powder concentration and continuous phase viscosity with the objective of obtaining process relevant recommendations based on the kinetics and me-chanisms of deagglomeration. findings obtained with representative test systems, dis-persions of hydrophilic silica particles in water and aqueous solutions, allowed recommendations to be obtained beyond the specifics of the study. mechanism of break up was consistent with that observed using other process devices and hence can be used as guidance for equipment selection at large scale. the complex, non-newtonian rheology of the pre-dispersions with increases in concentration and continuous phase viscosity slowed down deagglomeration kinetics, evolved during the course of deagglomeration and pointed out the need for careful design to achieve homogeneity within the dispersion in order to achieve the desired outcome from an energy intensive process.(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd on behalf of institution of chemical engineers. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://creati-vecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0449

"when a strong coupling between the equations of a specific physical problem exists, segregated solvers are likely to struggle or fail in finding the solution to the equation system. in this work, we propose an intuitive and physically-sound method that allows for block-coupled simulations in the openfoam (of) framework. first, we build and describe in detail the code structure for the assembly, storage, and solution of the system matrix for finite volume discretizations. this framework is the backbone for the implementation of the block-coupled solver we present after. great attention is focused on the implementation of an implicit density-based solver, which represents a novelty in the of context. a wide variety of test cases is proposed with the specific aim of assessing the performance of the new solver on different problems. where possible, a comparison with other built-in of solvers or other software is presented. it is shown that the new solver outperforms the current explicit density-based of solver and shows similar, if not better, performances compared to other opensource and commercial softwares. in a fully opensource philosophy, the library files are freely accessible in the authors repository at the link: https://github .com /stefanooliani /icsfoam.

"background and objectives: automatic segmentation of the cerebral vasculature and aneurysms facilitates incidental detection of aneurysms. the assessment of aneurysm rupture risk assists with pre-operative treatment planning and enables in-silico investigation of cerebral hemodynamics within and in the vicin-ity of aneurysms. however, ensuring precise and robust segmentation of cerebral vessels and aneurysms in neuroimaging modalities such as three-dimensional rotational angiography (3dra) is challenging. the vasculature constitutes a small proportion of the image volume, resulting in a large class imbalance (rel-ative to surrounding brain tissue). additionally, aneurysms and vessels have similar image/appearance characteristics, making it challenging to distinguish the aneurysm sac from the vessel lumen.methods: we propose a novel multi-class convolutional neural network to tackle these challenges and facilitate the automatic segmentation of cerebral vessels and aneurysms in 3dra images. the proposed model is trained and evaluated on an internal multi-center dataset and an external publicly available challenge dataset. results: on the internal clinical dataset, our method consistently outperformed several state-of-the-art approaches for vessel and aneurysm segmentation, achieving an average dice score of 0.81 (0.15 higher than nnunet) and an average surface-to-surface error of 0.20 mm (less than the in-plane resolution (0.35 mm/pixel)) for aneurysm segmentation; and an average dice score of 0.91 and average surface-to-surface error of 0.25 mm for vessel segmentation. in 223 cases of a clinical dataset, our method accurately segmented 190 aneurysm cases.conclusions: the proposed approach can help address class imbalance problems and inter-class inter-ference problems in multi-class segmentation. besides, this method performs consistently on clinical datasets from four different sources and the generated results are qualified for hemodynamic simulation. code available at https://github.com/cistib/vessel-aneurysm-segmentation .(c) 2023 published by elsevier b.v.",AB_0449
"background and aims: perianal fistula represents one of the most disabling manifestations of crohn's disease (cd) due to complete destruction of the affected mucosa, which is replaced by granulation tissue and associated with changes in tissue organization. to date, the molecular mechanisms un-derlying perianal fistula formation are not well defined. here, we dissected the tissue changes in the fistula area and addressed whether a dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ecm) homeostasis can support fistula formation. methods: surgical specimens from perianal fistula tissue and the surrounding region of fistulizing cd were analyzed histo-logically and by rna sequencing. genes significantly modulated were validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction, west-ern blot, and immunofluorescence assays. the effect of the protein product of tnf-stimulated gene-6 (tsg-6) on cell morphology, phenotype, and ecm organization was investi-gated with endogenous lentivirus-induced overexpression of tsg-6 in caco-2 cells and with exogenous addition of recom-binant human tsg-6 protein to primary fibroblasts from region surrounding fistula. proliferative and migratory assays were performed. results: a markedly different organization of ecm was found across fistula and surrounding fistula regions with an increased expression of integrins and matrix metalloproteinases and hyaluronan (ha) staining in the fistula, associated with increased newly synthesized collagen fibers and mechano-sensitive proteins. among dysregulated genes associated with ecm, tnfai6 (gene encoding for tsg-6) was as significantly upregulated in the fistula compared with area surrounding fistula, where it promoted the pathological formation of com-plexes between heavy chains from inter-alpha-inhibitor and ha responsible for the formation of a crosslinked ecm. there was a positive correlation between tnfai6 expression and expres-sion of mechanosensitive genes in fistula tissue. the over -expression of tsg-6 in caco-2 cells promoted migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, transcription factor snai1, and ha synthase (has) levels, while in fibroblasts, isolated from the area surrounding the fistula, it promoted an activated phenotype. moreover, the enrichment of an ha scaffold with recombinant human tsg-6 protein promoted collagen release and increase of snai1, itga4, itga42b, and ptk2b genes, the latter being involved in the transduction of responses to me-chanical stimuli. conclusions: by mediating changes in the ecm organization, tsg-6 triggers the epithelial-mesenchymal transition tran-scription factor snai1 through the activation of mechano-sensitive proteins. these data point to regulators of ecm as new potential targets for the treatment of cd perianal fistula.

"motivation: the wright-fisher diffusion is important in population genetics in modelling the evolution of allele frequencies over time subject to the influence of biological phenomena such as selection, mutation and genetic drift. simulating the paths of the process is challenging due to the form of the transition density. we present ewf, a robust and efficient sampler which returns exact draws for the diffusion and diffusion bridge processes, accounting for general models of selection including those with frequency dependence. results: given a configuration of selection, mutation and endpoints, ewf returns draws at the requested sampling times from the law of the corresponding wright-fisher process. output was validated by comparison to approximations of the transition density via the kolmogorov-smirnov test and qq plots. availability and implementation: all softwares are available at https://github.com/jarosant/ewf. contact: jaromir.sant@stats.ox.ac.uk supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0449
"motivation: missing data and incomplete lineage sorting (ils) are two major obstacles to accurate species tree inference. gene tree summary methods such as astral and astrid have been developed to account for ils. however, they can be severely affected by high levels of missing data. results: we present asteroid, a novel algorithm that infers an unrooted species tree from a set of unrooted gene trees. we show on both empirical and simulated datasets that asteroid is substantially more accurate than astral and astrid for very high proportions (>80%) of missing data. asteroid is several orders of magnitude faster than astral for datasets that contain thousands of genes. it offers advanced features such as parallelization, support value computation and support for multi-copy and multifurcating gene trees. availability and implementation: asteroid is freely available at https://github.com/benoitmorel/asteroid. contact: benoit.morel@h-its.org supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0449
"there have been reports of poor-quality research during the covid-19 pandemic. this registered report assessed design characteristics of registered clinical trials for covid-19 compared to non-covid-19 trials to empirically explore the design of clinical research during a pandemic and how it compares to research conducted in non-pandemic times. we did a retrospective cohort study with a 1 : 1 ratio of interventional covid-19 registrations to non-covid-19 registrations, with four trial design outcomes: use of control arm, randomization, blinding and prospective registration. logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio of investigating covid-19 versus not covid-19 and estimate direct and total effects of investigating covid-19 for each outcome. the primary analysis showed a positive direct and total effect of covid-19 on the use of control arms and randomization. it showed a negative direct effect of covid-19 on blinding but no evidence of a total effect. there was no evidence of an effect on prospective registration. taken together with secondary and sensitivity analyses, our findings are inconclusive but point towards a higher prevalence of key design characteristics in covid-19 trials versus controls. the findings do not support much existing covid-19 research quality literature, which generally suggests that covid-19 led to a reduction in quality. limitations included some data quality issues, minor deviations from the pre-registered plan and the fact that trial registrations were analysed which may not accurately reflect study design and conduct. following in-principle acceptance, the approved stage 1 version of this manuscript was pre-registered on the open science framework at https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/5yaeb. this pre-registration was performed prior to data analysis.",AB_0449
