"the 3d point cloud data are used to analyze plant morphological structure. organ segmentation of a single plant can be directly used to determine the accuracy and reliability of organ-level phenotypic estimation in a point-cloud study. however, it is difficult to achieve a high-precision, automatic, and fast plant point cloud segmentation. besides, a few methods can easily integrate the global structural features and local morphological features of point clouds relatively at a reduced cost. in this paper, a distance field-based segmentation pipeline (dfsp) which could code the global spatial structure and local connection of a plant was developed to realize rapid organ location and segmentation. the terminal point clouds of different plant organs were first extracted via dfsp during the stem-leaf segmentation, followed by the identification of the low-end point cloud of maize stem based on the local geometric features. the regional growth was then combined to obtain a stem point cloud. finally, the instance segmentation of the leaf point cloud was realized using dfsp. the segmentation method was tested on 420 maize and compared with the manually obtained ground truth. notably, dfsp had an average processing time of 1.52 s for about 15,000 points of maize plant data. the mean precision, recall, and micro f1 score of the dfsp segmentation algorithm were 0.905, 0.899, and 0.902, respectively. these findings suggest that dfsp can accurately, rapidly, and automatically achieve maize stem-leaf segmentation tasks and could be effective in maize phenotype research. the source code can be found at https://github.com/syau-miao/dfsp.git.",AB_0262
"plant diseases threaten global food security by reducing crop yield; thus, diagnosing plant diseases is critical to agricultural production. artificial intelligence technologies gradually replace traditional plant disease diagnosis methods due to their time-consuming, costly, inefficient, and subjective disadvantages. as a mainstream ai method, deep learning has substantially improved plant disease detection and diagnosis for precision agriculture. in the meantime, most of the existing plant disease diagnosis methods usually adopt a pre-trained deep learning model to support diagnosing diseased leaves. however, the commonly used pre-trained models are from the computer vision dataset, not the botany dataset, which barely provides the pre-trained models sufficient domain knowledge about plant disease. furthermore, this pre-trained way makes the final diagnosis model more difficult to distinguish between different plant diseases and lowers the diagnostic precision. to address this issue, we propose a series of commonly used pre-trained models based on plant disease images to promote the performance of disease diagnosis. in addition, we have experimented with the plant disease pre-trained model on plant disease diagnosis tasks such as plant disease identification, plant disease detection, plant disease segmentation, and other subtasks. the extended experiments prove that the plant disease pre-trained model can achieve higher accuracy than the existing pre-trained model with less training time, thereby supporting the better diagnosis of plant diseases. in addition, our pre-trained models will be open-sourced at https://pd.samlab.cn/ and zenodo platform https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7856293.",AB_0262
"long non-coding rna (lncrna) are shown to be closely associated with cancer metastatic events (cme, e.g., cancer cell invasion, intravasation, extravasation, proliferation) that collaboratively accelerate malignant cancer spread and cause high mortality rate in patients. clinical trials may accurately uncover the relationships between lncrnas and cmes; however, it is time-consuming and expensive. with the accumulation of data, there is an urgent need to find efficient ways to identify these relationships. herein, a graph embedding representation-based predictor (vgea-lcme) for exploring latent lncrna-cme associations is introduced. in vgea-lcme, a heterogeneous combined network is constructed by integrating similarity and linkage matrix that can maintain internal and external characteristics of networks, and a variational graph auto-encoder serves as a feature generator to represent arbitrary lncrna and cme pair. the final robustness predicted result is obtained by ensemble classifier strategy via cross-validation. experimental comparisons and literature verification show better remarkable performance of vgea-lcme, although the similarities between cmes are challenging to calculate. in addition, vgea-lcme can further identify organ-specific cmes. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first computational attempt to discover the potential relationships between lncrnas and cmes. it may provide support and new insight for guiding experimental research of metastatic cancers. the source code and data are available at https://github .com /zhuyuan -cug /vgae-lcme.",AB_0262
"accurate polyp segmentation is important for the diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer. in recent years, efforts have been made to improve the encoder-decoder framework by using global features and attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and help improve the segmentation of diverse polyps. however, few studies have considered the impacts of the polyp size, texture, and complex pathological environments on the segmentation performance. considering the above challenges, this paper proposes a global-local feature-based encoder -decoder framework, named crcnet comprising two components: a global-local context module (glcm) and multi-modality cross attention (mmca). the glcm is responsible for capturing global and local information from all deep encoders, enabling accurate weighting of the context feature information for each region in the path-ological image. the mmca is in charge of adding background, boundary, and foreground factors for judgment when merging shallow features while paying more attention to doubtful and complicated regions. we conducted extensive experiments on the kvasir-seg and cvc-clinicdb datasets, crcnet achieved state-of-the-art results in terms of segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, with dice and miou of 91.59 % and 90.57 % for kvasir-seg, respectively, and 95.02 % and 94.48 % for cvc-clinicdb, respectively. thus, crcnet shows a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art method. the corresponding code is available at: https://github. com/1152067715/crcnet.",AB_0262
"underwater images suffer from color casts and low contrast degraded due to wavelength-dependent light scatter and abortion of the underwater environment, which impacts the application of high-level computer vision tasks. considering the characteristics of uneven degradation and loss of color channel of underwater images, a novel dual attention transformer-based underwater image en-hancement method, called udaformer, is proposed. specifically, dual attention transformer block (datb) combining channel self-attention transformer (csat) with pixel self-attention transformer is proposed for efficient encoding and decoding of underwater image features. then, the shifted window method for the pixel self-attention (sw-psat) is proposed to improve computational efficiency. finally, the underwater images are recovered through the design of residual connections based on the underwater imaging model. experimental results demonstrate the proposed udaformer surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. the code is publicly available at: https://github.com/shenzhen0502/udaformer.(c) 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0262
"objective: during the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, an increased mental burden has been widely reported among medical health workers such as physicians and nurses. however, data on laboratory technicians exposed to covid-19 have rarely been published. the aim of this study was to assess the magnitude of psychological symptoms among laboratory technicians and analyze potential risk factors associated with these symptoms.methods: a cross-sectional online survey was performed via the wenjuanxing platform (a pro-fessional online questionnaire platform) (https://www.wjx.cn/mobile/statnew.aspx) to investi-gate the mental health of laboratory technicians during the covid-19 pandemic in hebei, china from october 4, 2021, to november 3, 2021. the online questionnaire included demographic and occupational characteristics data of responders, and the symptom check list-90-revised (scl90-r)was used to quantify the magnitude of psychological symptoms among laboratory technicians. participants' demographic and occupational characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistical analyses. chi-square tests were applied to compare the severity of each symptom be-tween two or more groups. a binary logistic regression model was developed to identify the predictors of laboratory technicians' mental health in response to the covid-19 pandemic, and outcomes are presented as odds ratios and 95% confidence interval. statistical analysis was performed using spss version 21 (spss, new orchard road, armonk, new york, usa). results: a total of 3081 valid questionnaires were collected. of these 3081 participants, 338 (11.0%) reported a total scl90-r score >160, which indicated positive psychological symptoms. among the 338 participants who reported psychological problems, most of them were mild symptoms. several factors associated with mental health problems in laboratory technicians during covid-19 were found, which include a history of physical and/or psychological problems (all 10 symptoms p < 0.001), more than 10 years of work experience (depression symptoms: or = 2.350, p = 0.024; anxiety symptoms: or = 2.642, p = 0.038), frontline work (depression symptoms: or = 1.761, p = 0.001; anxiety symptoms: or = 2.619, p < 0.001; hostility symp-toms: or = 1.913, p = 0.001), participant in more than 3 times large-scale sars-cov-2 screenings and more than 36 h per week in sars-cov-2 nucleic acid testing.conclusion: a portion of laboratory technicians reported experiencing varying levels of psycho-logical burden. during the covid-19 pandemic, multiple interventions should be developed and implemented to address existing psychosocial challenges and promote the mental health of lab-oratory technicians.",AB_0262
"introduction many researchers used machine learning (ml) to predict the prognosis of breast cancer (bc) patients and noticed that the ml model had good individualized prediction performance. objective the cohort study was intended to establish a reliable data analysis model by comparing the performance of 10 common ml algorithms and the the traditional american joint committee on cancer (ajcc) stage, and used this model in web application development to provide a good individualized prediction for others. methods this study included 63145 bc patients from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database. results through the performance of the 10 ml algorithms and 7th ajcc stage in the optimal test set, we found that in terms of 5-year overall survival, multivariate adaptive regression splines (mars) had the highest area under the curve (auc) value (0.831) and f1-score (0.608), and both sensitivity (0.737) and specificity (0.772) were relatively high. besides, mars showed a highest auc value (0.831, 95%confidence interval: 0.820-0.842) in comparison to the other ml algorithms and 7th ajcc stage (all p < 0.05). mars, the best performing model, was selected for web application development (https://w12251393. shinyapps.io/app2/). conclusions the comparative study of multiple forecasting models utilizing a large data noted that mars based model achieved a much better performance compared to other ml algorithms and 7th ajcc stage in individualized estimation of survival of bc patients, which was very likely to be the next step towards precision medicine.",AB_0262
"recently, vision transformer has gained a breakthrough in image recognition. its self-attention mechanism (msa) can extract discriminative tokens information from different patches to improve image classification accuracy. however, the classification token in its deep layer ignore the local features between layers. in addition, the patch embedding layer feeds fixed-size patches into the network, which inevitably introduces additional image noise. therefore, we propose a hierarchical attention vision transformer (havt) based on the transformer framework. we present a data augmentation method for attention cropping to crop and drop image noise and force the network to learn key features. second, the hierarchical attention selection (has) module is proposed, which improves the network's ability to learn discriminative tokens between layers by filtering and fusing tokens be-tween layers. experimental results show that the proposed havt outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and significantly improves the accuracy to 91.8% and 91.0% on cub-200-2011 and stanford dogs, respectively. we have released our source code on github https://github.com/ohjackhu/havt.git.",AB_0262
"parkinson's disease (pd) is a common neurodegenerative movement disorder among older individuals. as one of the typical symptoms of pd, tremor is a critical reference in the pd assessment. a widely accepted clinical approach to assessing tremors in pd is based on part iii of the movement disorder society-unified parkinson's disease rating scale (mds-updrs). however, expert assessment of tremor is a time-consuming and laborious process that poses considerable challenges to the medical evaluation of pd. in this paper, we proposed a novel model, global temporal-difference shift network (gtsn), to estimate the mds-updrs score of pd tremors based on video. the pd tremor videos were scored according to the majority vote of multiple raters. we used eulerian video magnification (evm) pre-processing to enhance the representations of subtle pd tremors in the videos. to make the model better focus on the tremors in the video, we proposed a special temporal difference module, which stacks the current optical flow to the result of inter-frame difference. the prediction scores were obtained from the residual networks (resnet) embedded with a novel module, the global shift module (gsm), which allowed the features of the current segment to include the global segment features. we carried out independent experiments using pd tremor videos of different body parts based on the scoring content of the mds-updrs. on a fairly large dataset, our method achieved an accuracy of 90.6% for hands with rest tremors, 85.9% for tremors in the leg, and 89.0% for the jaw. an accuracy of 84.9% was obtained for postural tremors. our study demonstrated the effectiveness of computer-assisted assessment for pd tremors based on video analysis. the latest version of the code is available at https://github.com/199507284711/pd-gtsn.",AB_0262
"background. identifying the cell types using unsupervised methods is essential for scrna-seq research. however, conventional similarity measures introduce challenges to single-cell data clustering because of the high dimensional, high noise, and high dropout. methods. we proposed a clustering method for small scrna-seq data based on subspace and weighted distance (sswd), which follows the assumption that the sets of gene subspace composed of similar density-distributing genes can better distinguish cell groups. to accurately capture the intrinsic relationship among cells or genes, a new distance metric that combines euclidean and pearson distance through a weighting strategy was proposed. the relative calinski-harabasz (ch) index was used to estimate the cluster numbers instead of the ch index because it is comparable across degrees of freedom. results. we compared sswd with seven prevailing methods on eight publicly scrnaseq datasets. the experimental results show that the sswd has better clustering accuracy and the partitioning ability of cell groups. sswd can be downloaded at https://github.com/ningzilan/sswd.",AB_0262
