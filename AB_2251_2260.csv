"for refining and designing protein structures, it is essential to have an efficient protein folding and docking framework that generates a protein 3d structure based on given constraints. in this study, we introduce opus-fold3 as a gradient-based, all-atom protein folding and docking framework, which accurately generates 3d protein structures in compliance with specified constraints, such as a potential function as long as it can be expressed as a function of positions of heavy atoms. our tests show that, for example, opus-fold3 achieves performance comparable to pyrosetta in backbone folding and significantly better in side-chain modeling. developed using python and tensorflow 2.4, opus-fold3 is user-friendly for any source-code level modifications and can be seamlessly combined with other deep learning models, thus facilitating collaboration between the biology and ai communities. the source code of opus-fold3 can be downloaded from http://github.com/opus-malab/opus_fold3. it is freely available for academic usage.",AB_0226
"recent studies have shed light on the potential of circular rna (circrna) as a biomarker for disease diagnosis and as a nucleic acid vaccine. the exploration of these functionalities requires correct circrna full-length sequences; however, existing assembly tools can only correctly assemble some circrnas, and their performance can be further improved. here, we introduce a novel feature known as the junction contig (jc), which is an extension of the back-splice junction (bsj). leveraging the strengths of both bsj and jc, we present a novel method called jccirc (https://github.com/cbbzhang/jccirc). it enables efficient reconstruction of all types of circrna full-length sequences and their alternative isoforms using splice graphs and fragment coverage. our findings demonstrate the superiority of jccirc over existing methods on human simulation datasets, and its average f1 score surpasses circast by 0.40 and outperforms both ciri-full and circrnafull by 0.13. for circrnas below 400 bp, 400-800 bp, 800 bp-1200 bp and above 1200 bp, the correct assembly rates are 0.13, 0.09, 0.04 and 0.03 higher, respectively, than those achieved by existing methods. moreover, jccirc also outperforms existing assembly tools on other five model species datasets and real sequencing datasets. these results show that jccirc is a robust tool for accurately assembling circrna full-length sequences, laying the foundation for the functional analysis of circrnas.",AB_0226
"the interactions between nucleic acids and proteins are important in diverse biological processes. the high-quality prediction of nucleic-acid-binding sites continues to pose a significant challenge. presently, the predictive efficacy of sequence-based methods is constrained by their exclusive consideration of sequence context information, whereas structure-based methods are unsuitable for proteins lacking known tertiary structures. though protein structures predicted by alphafold2 could be used, the extensive computing requirement of alphafold2 hinders its use for genome-wide applications. based on the recent breakthrough of esmfold for fast prediction of protein structures, we have developed glmsite, which accurately identifies dna- and rna-binding sites using geometric graph learning on esmfold predicted structures. here, the predicted protein structures are employed to construct protein structural graph with residues as nodes and spatially neighboring residue pairs for edges. the node representations are further enhanced through the pre-trained language model prottrans. the network was trained using a geometric vector perceptron, and the geometric embeddings were subsequently fed into a common network to acquire common binding characteristics. finally, these characteristics were input into two fully connected layers to predict binding sites with dna and rna, respectively. through comprehensive tests on dna/rna benchmark datasets, glmsite was shown to surpass the latest sequence-based methods and be comparable with structure-based methods. moreover, the prediction was shown useful for inferring nucleic-acid-binding proteins, demonstrating its potential for protein function discovery. the datasets, codes, and trained models are available at https://github.com/biomed-ai/nucleic-acid-binding.",AB_0226
"cell-cell communication events (ces) are mediated by multiple ligand-receptor (lr) pairs. usually only a particular subset of ces directly works for a specific downstream response in a particular microenvironment. we name them as functional communication events (fces) of the target responses. decoding fce-target gene relations is: important for understanding the mechanisms of many biological processes, but has been intractable due to the mixing of multiple factors and the lack of direct observations. we developed a method holonet for decoding fces using spatial transcriptomic data by integrating lr pairs, cell-type spatial distribution and downstream gene expression into a deep learning model. we modeled ces as a multi-view network, developed an attention-based graph learning method to train the model for generating target gene expression with the ce networks, and decoded the fces for specific downstream genes by interpreting trained models. we applied holonet on three visium datasets of breast cancer and liver cancer. the results detangled the multiple factors of fces by revealing how lr signals and cell types affect specific biological processes, and specified fce-induced effects in each single cell. we conducted simulation experiments and showed that holonet is more reliable on lr prioritization in comparison with existing methods. holonet is a powerful tool to illustrate cell-cell communication landscapes and reveal vital fces that shape cellular phenotypes. holonet is available as a python package at https://github.com/lhc17/holonet.",AB_0226
"soybean is a globally significant crop, playing a vital role in human nutrition and agriculture. its complex genetic structure and wide trait variation, however, pose challenges for breeders and researchers aiming to optimize its yield and quality. addressing this biological complexity requires innovative and accurate tools for trait prediction. in response to this challenge, we have developed soydngp, a deep learning-based model that offers significant advancements in the field of soybean trait prediction. compared to existing methods, such as deepgs and dnngp, soydngp boasts a distinct advantage due to its minimal increase in parameter volume and superior predictive accuracy. through rigorous performance comparison, including prediction accuracy and model complexity, soydngp represents improved performance to its counterparts. furthermore, it effectively predicted complex traits with remarkable precision, demonstrating robust performance across different sample sizes and trait complexities. we also tested the versatility of soydngp across multiple crop species, including cotton, maize, rice and tomato. our results showed its consistent and comparable performance, emphasizing soydngp's potential as a versatile tool for genomic prediction across a broad range of crops. to enhance its accessibility to users without extensive programming experience, we designed a user-friendly web server, available at http://xtlab.hzau.edu.cn/soydngp. the server provides two features: 'trait lookup', offering users the ability to access pre-existing trait predictions for over 500 soybean accessions, and 'trait prediction', allowing for the upload of vcf files for trait estimation. by providing a high-performing, accessible tool for trait prediction, soydngp opens up new possibilities in the quest for optimized soybean breeding.",AB_0226
"immune evasion and metabolism reprogramming have been regarded as two vital hallmarks of the mechanism of carcinogenesis. thus, targeting the immune microenvironment and the reprogrammed metabolic processes will aid in developing novel anti-cancer drugs. in recent decades, herbal medicine has been widely utilized to treat cancer through the modulation of the immune microenvironment and reprogrammed metabolic processes. however, labor-based herbal ingredient screening is time consuming, laborious and costly. luckily, some computational approaches have been proposed to screen candidates for drug discovery rapidly. yet, it has been challenging to develop methods to screen drug candidates exclusively targeting specific pathways, especially for herbal ingredients which exert anti-cancer effects by multiple targets, multiple pathways and synergistic ways. meanwhile, currently employed approaches cannot quantify the contribution of the specific pathway to the overall curative effect of herbal ingredients. hence, to address this problem, this study proposes a new computational framework to infer the contribution of the immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming (coimmr) in herbal ingredients against human cancer and specifically screen herbal ingredients targeting the immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming. finally, coimmr was applied to identify isoliquiritigenin that specifically regulates the t cells in stomach adenocarcinoma and cephaelin hydrochloride that specifically targets metabolic reprogramming in low-grade glioma. the in silico results were further verified using in vitro experiments. taken together, our approach opens new possibilities for repositioning drugs targeting immune and metabolic dysfunction in human cancer and provides new insights for drug development in other diseases. coimmr is available at https://github.com/lyn2323/coimmr.",AB_0226
"copy number alterations (cnas) are a key characteristic of tumor development and progression. the accumulation of various cnas during tumor development plays a critical role in driving tumor evolution. heterogeneous clones driven by distinct cnas have different selective advantages, leading to differential patterns of tumor evolution that are essential for developing effective cancer therapies. recent advances in single-cell sequencing technology have enabled genome-wide copy number profiling of tumor cell populations at single-cell resolution. this has made it possible to explore the evolutionary patterns of cnas and accurately discover the mechanisms of intra-tumor heterogeneity. here, we propose a two-step statistical approach that distinguishes neutral, linear, branching and punctuated evolutionary patterns for a tumor cell population based on single-cell copy number profiles. we assessed our approach using a variety of simulated and real single-cell genomic and transcriptomic datasets, demonstrating its high accuracy and robustness in predicting tumor evolutionary patterns. we applied our approach to single-cell dna sequencing data from 20 breast cancer patients and observed that punctuated evolution is the dominant evolutionary pattern in breast cancer. similar conclusions were drawn when applying the approach to single-cell rna sequencing data obtained from 132 various cancer patients. moreover, we found that differential immune cell infiltration is associated with specific evolutionary patterns. the source code of our study is available at https://github.com/fangwang-sysu/ptem.",AB_0226
"the microbiota-gut-brain axis denotes a two-way system of interactions between the gut and the brain, comprising three key components: (1) gut microbiota, (2) intermediates and (3) mental ailments. these constituents communicate with one another to induce changes in the host's mood, cognition and demeanor. knowledge concerning the regulation of the host central nervous system by gut microbiota is fragmented and mostly confined to disorganized or semi-structured unrestricted texts. such a format hinders the exploration and comprehension of unknown territories or the further advancement of artificial intelligence systems. hence, we collated crucial information by scrutinizing an extensive body of literature, amalgamated the extant knowledge of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and depicted it in the form of a knowledge graph named mmikg, which can be visualized on the graphxr platform and the neo4j database, correspondingly. by merging various associated resources and deducing prospective connections between gut microbiota and the central nervous system through mmikg, users can acquire a more comprehensive perception of the pathogenesis of mental disorders and generate novel insights for advancing therapeutic measures. as a free and open-source platform, mmikg can be accessed at http://yangbiolab.cn:8501/ with no login requirement.",AB_0226
"identifying the potential bacteriophages (phage) candidate to treat bacterial infections plays an essential role in the research of human pathogens. computational approaches are recognized as a valid way to predict bacteria and target phages. however, most of the current methods only utilize lower-order biological information without considering the higher-order connectivity patterns, which helps to improve the predictive accuracy. therefore, we developed a novel microbial heterogeneous interaction network (mhin)-based model called ptbgrp to predict new phages for bacterial hosts. specifically, ptbgrp first constructs an mhin by integrating phage-bacteria interaction (pbi) and six bacteria-bacteria interaction networks with their biological attributes. then, different representation learning methods are deployed to extract higher-level biological features and lower-level topological features from mhin. finally, ptbgrp employs a deep neural network as the classifier to predict unknown pbi pairs based on the fused biological information. experiment results demonstrated that ptbgrp achieves the best performance on the corresponding eskape pathogens and pbi dataset when compared with state-of-art methods. in addition, case studies of klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus further indicate that the consideration of rich heterogeneous information enables ptbgrp to accurately predict pbi from a more comprehensive perspective. the webserver of the ptbgrp predictor is freely available at http://120.77.11.78/ptbgrp/.",AB_0226
"binary code similarity analysis is widely used in the field of vulnerability search where source code may not be available to detect whether two binary functions are similar or not. based on deep learning and natural processing techniques, several approaches have been proposed to perform cross-platform binary code similarity analysis using control flow graphs. however, existing schemes suffer from the shortcomings of large differences in instruction syntaxes across different target platforms, inability to align control flow graph nodes, and less introduction of high-level semantics of stability, which pose challenges for identifying similar computations between binary functions of different platforms generated from the same source code. we argue that extracting stable, platform-independent semantics can improve model accuracy, and a cross-platform binary function similarity comparison model n_match is proposed. the model elevates different platform instructions to the same semantic space to shield their underlying platform instruction differences, uses graph embedding technology to learn the stability semantics of neighbors, extracts high-level knowledge of naming function to alleviate the differences brought about by cross-platform and cross-optimization levels, and combines the stable graph structure as well as the stable, platform-independent api knowledge of naming function to represent the final semantics of functions. the experimental results show that the model accuracy of n_match outperforms the baseline model in terms of cross-platform, cross-optimization level, and industrial scenarios. in the vulnerability search experiment, n_match significantly improves hit@n, the map exceeds the current graph embedding model by 66%. in addition, we also give several interesting observations from the experiments. the code and model are publicly available at https://www.github.com/csecurityzhongyuan/binary-name_match.",AB_0226
