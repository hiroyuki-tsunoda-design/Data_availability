"introduction while living donor (ld) kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with kidney failure, lds assume a higher risk of future kidney failure themselves. lds of african ancestry have an even greater risk of kidney failure post-donation than white lds. because evidence suggests that apolipoprotein l1 (apol1) risk variants contribute to this greater risk, transplant nephrologists are increasingly using apol1 genetic testing to evaluate ld candidates of african ancestry. however, nephrologists do not consistently perform genetic counselling with ld candidates about apol1 due to a lack of knowledge and skill in counselling. without proper counselling, apol1 testing will magnify ld candidates' decisional conflict about donating, jeopardising their informed consent. given cultural concerns about genetic testing among people of african ancestry, protecting ld candidates' safety is essential to improve informed decisions about donating. clinical 'chatbots', mobile apps that provide genetic information to patients, can improve informed treatment decisions. no chatbot on apol1 is available and no nephrologist training programmes are available to provide culturally competent counselling to lds about apol1. given the shortage of genetic counsellors, increasing nephrologists' genetic literacy is critical to integrating genetic testing into practice. methods and analysis using a non-randomised, pre-post trial design in two transplant centres (chicago, il, and washington, dc), we will evaluate the effectiveness of culturally competent apol1 testing, chatbot and counselling on ld candidates' decisional conflict about donating, preparedness for decision-making, willingness to donate and satisfaction with informed consent and longitudinally evaluate the implementation of this intervention into clinical practice using the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance framework. ethics and dissemination this study will create a model for apol1 testing of lds of african ancestry, which can be implemented nationally via implementation science approaches. apol1 will serve as a model for integrating culturally competent genetic testing into transplant and other practices to improve informed consent. this study involves human participants and was approved by northwestern university irb (stu00214038). participants gave informed consent to participate in the study before taking part. trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct04910867. registered 8 may 2021, https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/prs/app/action/selectprotocol?sid=s000awz6&selectaction=edit&uid=u0001ppf&ts=7&cx=-8jv7m2 clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct04999436. registered 5 november 2021, https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/prs/app/action/selectprotocol?sid=s000ayww&selectaction=edit&uid=u0001ppf&ts=11&cx=9tny7v",AB_0612
"carbohydrate active enzymes (cazymes) are made by various organisms for complex carbohydrate metabolism. genome mining of cazymes has become a routine data analysis in (meta-)genome projects, owing to the importance of cazymes in bioenergy, microbiome, nutrition, agriculture, and global carbon recycling. in 2012, dbcan was provided as an online web server for automated cazyme annotation. dbcan2 (https://bcb.unl.edu/dbcan2) was further developed in 2018 as a meta server to combine multiple tools for improved cazyme annotation. dbcan2 also included cgc-finder, a tool for identifying cazyme gene clusters (cgcs) in (meta)genomes. we have updated the meta server to dbcan3 with the following new functions and components: (i) dbcan-sub as a profile hidden markov model database (hmmdb) for substrate prediction at the cazyme subfamily level; (ii) searching against experimentally characterized polysaccharide utilization loci (puls) with known glycan substates of the dbcan-pul database for substrate prediction at the cgc level; (iii) a majority voting method to consider all cazymes with substrate predicted from dbcansub for substrate prediction at the cgc level; (iv) improved data browsing and visualization of substrate prediction results on the website. in summary, dbcan3 not only inherits all the functions of dbcan2, but also integrates three new methods for glycan substrate prediction.",AB_0612
"a major impediment to researchers working in the area of fingerprint recognition is the lack of publicly available, large-scale, fingerprint datasets. the publicly available datasets that do exist contain very few identities and impressions per finger. this limits research on a number of topics, including e.g., using deep networks to learn fixed length fingerprint embeddings. therefore, we propose printsgan, a synthetic fingerprint generator capable of generating unique fingerprints along with multiple impressions for a given fingerprint. using printsgan, we synthesize a database of 525k fingerprints (35k distinct fingers, each with 15 impressions). next, we show the utility of the printsgan generated dataset by training a deep network to extract a fixed-length embedding from a fingerprint. in particular, an embedding model trained on our synthetic fingerprints and fine-tuned on a small number of publicly available real fingerprints (25k prints from nist sd 302) obtains a tar of 87.03% @ far=0.01% on the nist sd4 database (a boost from tar=73.37% when only trained on nist sd 302). prevailing synthetic fingerprint generation methods do not enable such performance gains due to i) lack of realism or ii) inability to generate multiple impressions per finger. our dataset is released to the public: https://biometrics.cse.msu.edu/publications/databases/msu_printsgan/",AB_0612
"study objectives: we assessed the real-world performance of the anne sleep system against 2 food and drug administration-cleared home sleep testing platforms and the intraindividual night-to-night variability of respiratory event index measured by anne sleep. methods: we evaluated the home performance of the anne sleep system compared with 2 food and drug administration-cleared home sleep testing platforms (watchpat: n = 29 and alice nightone: n = 46) during a synchronous night with unsupervised patient application. additionally, we evaluated night-to-night variability of respiratory event index and total sleep time using the anne sleep system (n = 30). results: for the diagnosis of moderate and severe obstructive sleep apnea, the anne sleep system had a positive percent agreement of 58% (95% confidence interval, 28-85%) and a negative percent agreement of 100% (95% confidence interval, 80-100%) compared to watchpat. the positive and negative percent agreement for anne sleep vs alice nightone was 85% (95% confidence interval, 66-96%) and 95% (95% confidence interval, 74-100%). there were no differences in mean total sleep time or respiratory event index across multiple nights of monitoring with anne. there were no differences consistent with a first-night effect but testing multiple nights reclassified obstructive sleep apnea severity in 5 (17%) individuals and detected 3 additional cases of moderate disease, with only a 12% (standard deviation, 28%) mean fluctuation in respiratory event index from the first night of testing compared to a mean of multiple nights. overall, 80% of users found anne comfortable and easy to use. conclusions: anne sleep exhibited stronger concordance with alice nightone compared to watchpat. while we illustrated low night-to-night variability for anne sleep, the results suggest multiple nights increased detection of moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea. clinical trial registration: registry: clinicaltrials.gov; name: anne diagnostic agreement with home sleep testing; url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ nct05421754; identifier: nct05421754.",AB_0612
"we present ash, a modern and high-performance framework for parallel spatial hashing on gpu. compared to existing gpu hash map implementations, ash achieves higher performance, supports richer functionality, and requires fewer lines of code (loc) when used for implementing spatially varying operations from volumetric geometry reconstruction to differentiable appearance reconstruction. unlike existing gpu hash maps, the ash framework provides a versatile tensor interface, hiding low-level details from the users. in addition, by decoupling the internal hashing data structures and key-value data in buffers, we offer direct access to spatially varying data via indices, enabling seamless integration to modern libraries such as pytorch. to achieve this, we 1) detach stored key-value data from the low-level hash map implementation; 2) bridge the pointer-first low level data structures to index-first high-level tensor interfaces via an index heap; 3) adapt both generic and non-generic integer-only hash map implementations as backends to operate on multi-dimensional keys. we first profile our hash map against state-of-the-art hash maps on synthetic data to show the performance gain from this architecture. we then show that ash can consistently achieve higher performance on various large-scale 3d perception tasks with fewer loc by showcasing several applications, including 1) point cloud voxelization, 2) retargetable volumetric scene reconstruction, 3) non-rigid point cloud registration and volumetric deformation, and 4) spatially varying geometry and appearance refinement. ash and its example applications are open sourced in open3d (http://www.open3d.org).",AB_0612
"we describe -pointbrowse, a web portal that gives access to the orthology inferences made for polyploid genomes with point, the polyploidy orthology inference tool. ancient, or paleo-, polyploidy events are widely distributed across the eukaryotic phylogeny, and the combination of duplicated and lost duplicated genes that these polyploidies produce can confound the identification of orthologous genes between genomes. point uses conserved synteny and phylogenetic models to infer orthologous genes between genomes with a shared polyploidy. it also gives confidence estimates for those orthology inferences. -pointbrowse gives both graphical and querybased access to these inferences from 12 different polyploidy events, allowing users to visualize genomic regions produced by polyploidies and perform batch queries for each polyploidy event, downloading genes trees and coding sequences for orthologous genes meeting user-specified criteria. -pointbrowse and the associated data are online at https://wgd.statgen.ncsu.edu.",AB_0612
"genomic instability is an important hallmark of cancer and more recently has been identified in others like neurodegenrative diseases. chromosomal instability, as a measure of genomic instability, has been used to characterize clinical and biological phenotypes associated with these diseases by measuring structural and numerical chromosomal alterations. there have been multiple chromosomal instability scores developed across many studies in the literature; however, these scores have not been compared because of the lack of a single tool available to calculate and facilitate these various metrics. here, we provide an r package cinmetrics, that calculates six different chromosomal instability scores and allows direct comparison between them. we also demonstrate how these scores differ by applying cinmetrics to breast cancer data from the cancer genome atlas (tcga). the package is available on cran at https://ran.rproject.org/package=cinmetrics and on github at https://github.com/ lasseignelab/cinmetrics.",AB_0612
"background: this study will evaluate functional family therapy-gangs (fft-g), an extension of a family-based therapeutic intervention-functional family therapy (fft)-designed to help troubled youth exhibiting mild to severe behavior problems overcome delinquency, substance abuse, and violence. fft-g, however, addresses risk factors that are typically more salient among gang than delinquent populations. a randomized control trial with adjudicated youth in philadelphia revealed reductions in recidivism over an 18-month period. the purposes of this paper are to outline the protocol for replicating fft-g in the denver metropolitan area, document the design and challenges of the prospective research, and promote transparency. methods: as a condition of pre-trial or probation supervision, 400 youth/caregiver dyads will be randomly assigned to fft-g or a treatment-as-usual control group. preregistered confirmatory outcomes include recidivism (i.e., criminal/delinquent charges and adjudications/convictions) measured using official records (open science framework: https://osf.io/abyfs). secondary outcomes include measures of gang embeddedness, non-violent and violent recidivism, and substance use measured using interview-based surveys and arrest, revocation, incarceration, and crime type indicators of recidivism from official records. exploratory mediation and moderation analyses are also planned. intent-to-treat regression analyses will estimate intervention effects 18 months postrandomization. conclusion: this study will contribute to advancing high-quality evidence-based knowledge on gang interventions for which there are few known effective responses.",AB_0612
"repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) is an established treatment for major depressive disorder (mdd) and shows promise for posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd), yet effectiveness varies. electroencephalography (eeg) can identify rtms-associated brain changes. eeg oscillations are often examined using averaging approaches that mask finer time-scale dynamics. recent advances show some brain oscillations emerge as transient increases in power, a phenomenon termed spectral events, and that event characteristics correspond with cognitive functions. we applied spectral event analyses to identify potential eeg biomarkers of effective rtms treatment. resting 8-electrode eeg was collected from 23 patients with mdd and ptsd before and after 5 hz rtms targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. using an open-source toolbox (https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/spectralevents), we quantified event features and tested for treatment associated changes. spectral events in delta/theta (1-6 hz), alpha (7-14 hz), and beta (15-29 hz) bands occurred in all patients. rtms-induced improvement in comorbid mdd ptsd were associated with pre- to post-treatment changes in fronto-central electrode beta event features, including frontal beta event frequency spans and durations, and central beta event maxima power. furthermore, frontal pre-treatment beta event duration correlated negatively with mdd symptom improvement. beta events may provide new biomarkers of clinical response and advance the understanding of rtms.",AB_0612
"the critical first step in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)associated (crisprcas) protein-mediated gene editing is recognizing a preferred protospacer adjacent motif (pam) on target dnas by the proteins pam-interacting amino acids (piaas). thus, accurate computational modeling of pam recognition is useful in assisting crisprcas engineering to relax or tighten pam requirements for subsequent applications. here, we describe a universal computational protein design framework (unidesign) for designing proteinnucleic acid interactions. as a proof of concept, we applied unidesign to decode the pampiaa interactions for eight cas9 and two cas12a proteins. we show that, given native piaas, the unidesign-predicted pams are largely identical to the natural pams of all cas proteins. in turn, given natural pams, the computationally redesigned piaa residues largely recapitulated the native piaas (74% and 86% in terms of identity and similarity, respectively). these results demonstrate that unidesign faithfully captures the mutual preference between natural pams and native piaas, suggesting it is a useful tool for engineering crisprcas and other nucleic acid-interacting proteins. unidesign is open-sourced at https://github.com/tommyhuangthu/unidesign.",AB_0612
