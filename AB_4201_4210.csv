"backgroundpolycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is the most prevalent, chronic endocrine-metabolic disorder of adolescents and young women (ayas), affecting 5-10% of ayas worldwide. there is no approved pharmacological therapy for pcos. standard off-label treatment with oral contraceptives (ocs) reverts neither the underlying pathophysiology nor the associated co-morbidities. pilot studies have generated new insights into the pathogenesis of pcos, leading to the development of a new treatment consisting of a fixed, low-dose combination of two so-called insulin sensitisers [pioglitazone (pio), metformin (met)] and one mixed anti-androgen and anti-mineralocorticoid also acting as an activator of brown adipose tissue [spironolactone (spi)], within a single tablet (spiomet). the present trial will evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of spiomet, on top of lifestyle measures, for the treatment of pcos in ayas.methodsin this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-arm, parallel-group, phase ii clinical trial, ayas with pcos will be recruited from 7 clinical centres across europe. intention is to randomise a total of 364 eligible patients into four arms (1:1:1:1): placebo, pio, spi + pio (spio) and spi + pio + met (spiomet). active treatment over 12 months will consist of lifestyle guidance plus the ingestion of one tablet daily (at dinner time); post-treatment follow-up will span 6 months. primary endpoint is on- and post-treatment ovulation rate. secondary endpoints are clinical features (hirsutism, menstrual regularity); endocrine-metabolic variables (androgens, lipids, insulin, inflammatory markers); epigenetic markers; imaging data (carotid intima-media thickness, body composition, abdominal fat partitioning, hepatic fat); safety profile; adherence, tolerability and acceptability of the medication; and quality of life in the study participants. superiority (in this order) of spiomet, spio and pio will be tested over placebo, and if present, subsequently the superiority of spiomet versus pio, and if still present, finally versus spio.discussionthe present study will be the first to evaluate-in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled way-the efficacy, tolerability and safety of spiomet treatment for early pcos, on top of a lifestyle intervention.trial registrationeudract 2021-003177-58. registered on 22 december 2021.https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=%092021-003177-58.trial registrationeudract 2021-003177-58. registered on 22 december 2021.https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=%092021-003177-58.",AB_0421
"most current deep learning based approaches for image segmentation require annotations of large datasets, which limits their application in clinical practice. we observe a mismatch between the voxelwise ground-truth that is required to optimize an objective at a voxel level and the commonly used, less time-consuming clinical annotations seeking to characterize the most important information about the patient (diameters, counts, etc.).in this study, we propose to bridge this gap for the case of multiple nested star-shaped objects (e.g., a blood vessel lumen and its outer wall) by optimizing a deep learning model based on diameter annotations. this is achieved by extracting in a differentiable manner the boundary points of the objects at training time, and by using this extraction during the backpropagation. we evaluate the proposed approach on segmentation of the carotid artery lumen and wall from multisequence mr images, thus reducing the annotation burden to only four annotated landmarks required to measure the diameters in the direction of the vessel's maximum narrowing. our experiments show that training based on diameter annotations produces state-of-the-art weakly supervised segmentations and performs reasonably compared to full supervision.we made our code publicly available at https://gitlab.com/radiology/aim/carotid-artery-image-analysis/ nested-star-shaped-objects.",AB_0421
"hits from high-throughput screening (hts) of chemical libraries are often false positives due to their interference with assay detection technology. in response, we generated the largest publicly available library of chemical liabilities and developed liability predictor, a free web tool to predict hts artifacts. more specifically, we generated, curated, and integrated hts data sets for thiol reactivity, redox activity, and luciferase (firefly and nano) activity and developed and validated quantitative structure-interference relationship (qsir) models to predict these nuisance behaviors. the resulting models showed 58-78% external balanced accuracy for 256 external compounds per assay. qsir models developed and validated herein identify nuisance compounds among experimental hits more reliably than do popular pains filters. both the models and the curated data sets were implemented in liability predictor, publicly available at https://liability.mml.unc.edu/. liability predictor may be used as part of chemical library design or for triaging hts hits.",AB_0421
"artificial neural network emulators have been demonstrated to be a very computationally efficient method to rapidly generate galaxy spectral energy distributions, for parameter inference or otherwise. using a highly flexible and fast mathematical structure, they can learn the nontrivial relationship between input galaxy parameters and output observables. however, they do so imperfectly, and small errors in flux prediction can yield large differences in recovered parameters. in this work, we investigate the relationship between an emulator's execution time, uncertainties, correlated errors, and ability to recover accurate posteriors. we show that emulators can recover consistent results to traditional fits, with a precision of 25%-40% in posterior medians for stellar mass, stellar metallicity, star formation rate, and stellar age. we find that emulation uncertainties scale with an emulator's width n as ?n-1, while execution time scales as ?n-2, resulting in an inherent tradeoff between execution time and emulation uncertainties. we also find that emulators with uncertainties smaller than observational uncertainties are able to recover accurate posteriors for most parameters without a significant increase in catastrophic outliers. furthermore, we demonstrate that small architectures can produce flux residuals that have significant correlations, which can create dangerous systematic errors in colors. finally, we show that the distributions chosen for generating training sets can have a large effect on an emulator's ability to accurately fit rare objects. selecting the optimal architecture and training set for an emulator will minimize the computational requirements for fitting near-future large-scale galaxy surveys. we release our emulators on github (http://github.com/elijahmathews/ mathewsetal2023).",AB_0421
"microsatellites, also known as ssrs or strs, are polymorphic dna regions with tandem repetitions of a nucleotide motif of size 1-6 base pairs with a broad range of applications in many fields, such as comparative genomics, molecular biology, and forensics. however, the majority of researchers do not have computational training and struggle while running command-line tools or very limited web tools for their ssr research, spending a considerable amount of time learning how to execute the software and conducting the post-processing data tabulation in other tools or manually-time that could be used directly in data analysis. we present easyssr, a user-friendly web tool with command-line full functionality, designed for practical use in batch identifying and comparing ssrs in sequences, draft, or complete genomes, not requiring previous bioinformatic skills to run. easyssr requires only a fasta and an optional genbank file of one or more genomes to identify and compare strs. the tool can automatically analyze and compare ssrs in whole genomes, convert genbank to ptt files, identify perfect and imperfect ssrs and coding and non-coding regions, compare their frequencies, abundancy, motifs, flanking sequences, and iterations, producing many outputs ready for download such as ptt files, interactive charts, and excel tables, giving the user the data ready for further analysis in minutes. easyssr was implemented as a web application, which can be executed from any browser and is available for free at https://computationalbiology.ufpa.br/easyssr/. tutorials, usage notes, and download links to the source code can be found at https://github.com/engbiopct/easyssr.",AB_0421
"river water surface slopes (wss) can improve the performance of rating curves for discharge estimates and provides information about river hydraulic processes and phenomena. utilizing the beam pattern of icesat-2, the wss can be estimated by the slope of a linear regression of the water surface elevation and the distance along the river. this paper presents a robust processing scheme for calculating wss along rivers in the swot river database. we demonstrate the processing scheme for the amur river basin using four years of data. this yields 7306 wss estimates across 1693 reaches approximately 10 km in length. the slopes were estimated between 0.60 cm/km and 651.04 cm/km with a median standard error of 0.47 cm/km. the method works for slopes larger than 0.5 cm/km and river widths larger than 50 m. the software presented in this paper is available as the r package ice2wss on github (https://github. com/lindchr/ice2wss).",AB_0421
"the atypical protein kinase/atpase rio kinase (riok)-1 is involved in pre-40s ribosomal subunit production, cell-cycle progression, and protein arginine n-methyltransferase 5 methylosome substrate recruitment. riok1 overexpression is a characteristic of several malignancies and is correlated with cancer stage, therapy resistance, poor patient survival, and other prognostic factors. however, its role in prostate cancer (pca) is unknown. in this study, the expression, regulation, and therapeutic potential of riok1 in pca were examined. riok1 mrna and protein expression were elevated in pca tissue samples and correlated with proliferative and protein homeostasis-related pathways. riok1 was identified as a downstream target gene of the c-myc/e2f transcription factors. proliferation of pca cells was significantly reduced with riok1 knockdown and overexpression of the dominant-negative riok1d324a mutant. biochemical inhibition of riok1 with toyocamycin led to strong antiproliferative effects in androgen receptor-negative and -positive pca cell lines with ec50 values of 3.5 to 8.8 nmol/l. rapid decreases in riok1 protein expression and total rrna content, and a shift in the 28s/18s rrna ratio, were found with toyocamycin treatment. apoptosis was induced with toyocamycin treatment at a level similar to that with the chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel used in clinical practice. in summary, the current study indicates that riok1 is a part of the myc oncogene network, and as such, could be considered for future treatment of patients with pca.

"thapbi pict is an open source software pipeline for metabarcoding analysis of illumina paired-end reads, including cases of multiplexing where more than one amplicon is amplified per dna sample. initially a phytophthora its1 classification tool (pict), we demonstrate using worked examples with our own and public data sets how, with appropriate primer settings and a custom database, it can be applied to other amplicons and organisms, and used for reanalysis of existing datasets. the core dataflow of the implementation is (i) data reduction to unique marker sequences, often called amplicon sequence variants (asvs), (ii) dynamic thresholds for discarding low abundance sequences to remove noise and artifacts (rather than error correction by default), before (iii) classification using a curated reference database. the default classifier assigns a label to each query sequence based on a database match that is either perfect, or a single base pair edit away (substitution, deletion or insertion). abundance thresholds for inclusion can be set by the user or automatically using per-batch negative or synthetic control samples. output is designed for practical interpretation by non-specialists and includes a read report (asvs with classification and counts per sample), sample report (samples with counts per species classification), and a topological graph of asvs as nodes with short edit distances as edges. source code available from https://github.com/peterjc/ thapbi-pict/ with documentation including installation instructions.",AB_0421
"with the increasing number of lipidomic studies, thereis a needfor an efficient and automated analysis of lipidomic data. one ofthe challenges faced by most existing approaches to lipidomic dataanalysis is lipid nomenclature. the systematic nomenclature of lipidscontains all available information about the molecule, including itshierarchical representation, which can be used for statistical evaluation.the lipid over-representation analysis (lora) web application (https://lora.metabolomics.fgu.cas.cz) analyzes this information using the java-based goslin framework,which translates lipid names into a standardized nomenclature. goslinprovides the level of lipid hierarchy, including information on headgroups,acyl chains, and their modifications, up to the complete structurelevel. lora allows the user to upload the experimental query and referencedata sets, select a grammar for lipid name normalization, and thenprocess the data. the user can then interactively explore the resultsand perform lipid over-representation analysis based on selected criteria.the results are graphically visualized according to the lipidome hierarchy.the lipids present in the most over-represented terms (lipids withthe highest number of enriched shared structural features) are definedas very important lipids (vils). for example, the main result of ademo data set is the information that the query is significantly enrichedwith glycerophospholipids containing acyl20:4 at the sn-2 position.these terms define a set of vils (e.g., pc 18:2/20:4;o and pe 16:0/20:4(5,8,10,14);oh).all results, graphs, and visualizations are summarized in a report.lora is a tool focused on the smart mining of epilipidomics data setsto facilitate their interpretation at the molecular level.",AB_0421
"estimating the number of buildings in any geographical region is a vital component of urban analysis, disaster management, and public policy decision. deep learning methods for building localization and counting in satellite imagery, can serve as a viable and cheap alternative. however, these algorithms suffer performance degradation when applied to the regions on which they have not been trained. current large datasets mostly cover the developed regions and collecting such datasets for every region is a costly, time-consuming, and difficult endeavor. in this paper, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method for counting buildings where we use a labeled source domain (developed regions) and adapt the trained model on an unlabeled target domain (developing regions). we initially align distribution maps across domains by aligning the output space distribution through adversarial loss. we then exploit counting consistency constraints, within image count consistency, and across-image count consistency, to decrease the domain shift. within-image consistency enforces that the building count in the whole image should be greater than or equal to the count in any of its sub-image. across-image consistency constraint enforces that if an image contains considerably more buildings than the other image, then their sub-images shall also have the same order. these two constraints encourage the behavior to be consistent across and within the images, regardless of the scale. to evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we collected and annotated a large-scale dataset consisting of challenging south asian regions having higher building densities and irregular structures as compared to existing datasets. we perform extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of our approach and report improvements of approximately 7-20% over the competitive baseline methods. the dataset and code are available here: https://github.com/intelligentmachines-itu/domain-adaptive-building-counting.",AB_0421
