"over 2500 salmonella species (alternatively, serovars) encompassing different combinations of o-, h1and h2-antigens are present in nature and cause millions of deaths worldwide every year. since conventional serotyping is time-consuming, a user-friendly salmonella species serotyping (ssp) web tool (https://project.iith.ac.in/ssp/) is developed here to predict the serotypes using salmonella protein(s) or whole proteome sequences. prior to ssp implementation, a detailed analysis of protein sequences involved in o-antigen biosynthesis and h-antigen formation is carried out to assess their serotype specificity. intriguingly, the results indicate that the initializing transferases wbap, weca and gne can efficiently distinguish the o-antigens, which have gal, glcnac and galnac as initial sugars respectively. rigorous analysis shows that wzx and wzy are sufficient to distinguish the o-types. exceptionally, some situations warrant additional proteins. thus, 150 additional transferases, rfbe for o2, o9 and o9,46 types, orf17.4 for o3,10 and o1,3,19 types, wecb, wbbe and wbbf for o54 and, wzm and wzt for o67 are utilized in serotyping. an in-depth analysis of 302 reference datasets representing 56 h1- and 20 h2-types leads to the identification and utilization of 61 unique sequence patterns of flic and fljb in h-typing. a test dataset of 2136 whole proteome sequences covering 740 salmonella serovars, including 13 new species are successfully predicted with 99.72% accuracy. prior to this, all the o-, h1- and h2antigens are predicted accurately when tested independently. indeed, ssp also identifies wrongly annotated salmonella species; hence, it can easily identify new species that emerge with any combination of o-, h1- and h2-antigens. thus, ssp can act as a valuable tool in the surveillance of salmonella species.& copy; 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0516
"dietary components and bioactive molecules present in functional foods and nutraceuticals provide various beneficial effects including modulation of host gut microbiome. these metabolites along with orally administered drugs can be potentially bio-transformed by gut microbiome, which can alter their bioavailability and intended biological or pharmacological activity resulting in individual or population-specific variation in drug and dietary responses. experimental determination of microbiome-mediated metabolism of orally ingested molecules is difficult due to the enormous diversity and complexity of the gut microbiome. to address this problem, we developed gutbug, a web-based resource that predicts all possible bacterial metabolic enzymes that can potentially biotransform xenobiotics and biotic molecules using a combination of machine learning, neural networks and chemoinformatic methods. using 3,457 enzyme substrates for training and a curated database of 363,872 enzymes from similar to 700 gut bacterial strains, gutbug can predict complete ec number of the bacterial enzymes involved in a biotransformation reaction of the given molecule along with the reaction centres with accuracies between 0.78 and 0.97 across different reaction classes. validation of gutbug's performance using 27 molecules known to be biotransformed by human gut bacteria, including complex polysaccharides, flavonoids, and oral drugs further attests to gutbug's accuracy and utility. thus, gutbug enhances our understanding of various metabolite-gut bacterial interactions and their resultant effects on the human host health across populations, which will find enormous applications in diet design and intervention, identification and administration of new prebiotics, development of nutraceutical products, and improvements in drug designing. gutbug is available at https://metabiosys.iiserb.ac.in/gutbug.(c) 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0516
"in early 1990s, several proteins were shown to depend on additional stretches of polypeptide (termed as prosequence/prodomain) for their folding. these regions of the protein were often termed as imcs (intra molecular chaperones), since they would be cleaved from the mature folded protein eventually. such pro-teins were hypothesized to face a kinetic barrier to their folding, which was probably lowered by the pros-equences. in last three decades, numerous examples of such proteins have accumulated in literature. yet, no study has been reported so far attempting to understand the evolutionary differences and similar-itess of such proteins. till date such proteins are continued to be treated as anomalous variants, rather than as representatives of any alternate protein folding strategy. do such proteins have any distinctive structural facets or typical biological roles, necessitating an unconventional strategy of protein folding? do prosequences carry any unique or conserved features that are essential to their function? proseqa-prodb: prosequence assisted protein database, (which can be accessed at https://proseqaprodb.mku-lab.in) was built as a comprehensive database, to systematically study such proteins along with their pro -sequences. the database currently contains 2140 prosequence assisted proteins (1848 eukaryotic, 255 bacterial, 24 viral and 13 archaeal proteins), from 690 organisms later categorised into 960 families. we envisage that the availability of this curated dataset will enable the researchers worldwide to further their investigation in the origin, importance and evolution of such proteins, leading to better understanding of the protein folding process as a whole.& copy; 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0516
"prediction of orthologs is an important bioinformatics pursuit that is frequently used for inferring protein function and evolutionary analyses. the inparanoid database is a well known resource of ortholog predictions between a wide variety of organisms. although orthologs have historically been inferred at the level of full-length protein sequences, many proteins consist of several independent protein domains that may be orthologous to domains in other proteins in a way that differs from the full-length protein case. to be able to capture all types of orthologous relations, conventional full-length protein orthologs can be complemented with orthologs inferred at the domain level. we here present inparanoidb 9, covering 640 species and providing orthologs for both protein domains and full-length proteins. inparanoidb 9 was built using the faster inparanoid-diamond algorithm for orthology analysis, as well as domainoid and pfam to infer orthologous domains. inparanoidb 9 is based on proteomes from 447 eukaryotes, 158 bacteria and 35 archaea, and includes over one billion predicted ortholog groups. a new website has been built for the database, providing multiple search options as well as visualization of groups of orthologs and orthologous domains. this release constitutes a major upgrade of the inparanoid database in terms of the number of species as well as the new capability to operate on the domain level. inparanoidb 9 is available at https://inparanoidb.sbc.su.se/.& copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0516
"simplification of building footprints is an essential task in topographic map generalization from large to medium scales. the traditional rule-or constraint-based algorithms commonly require cartographers to enumerate and formalize as many scenarios as possible. recently, some studies have introduced deep learning to image map generalization, whose outputs, however, may exhibit deformed boundaries due to pure image input. vector maps are thus a reasonable solution to avoid such issues because of their accurate, object-based geometric representation. however, few existing studies have aimed to simplify buildings in vector maps with the help of neural networks. building simplification in vector maps can be regarded as the joint contribution from two elementary operations on vertices of building polygons: remove redundant vertices and move kept vertices. this research proposes a multi-task learning method with graph convolutional neural networks. the proposed method formulates the building simplification problem as a joint task of node removal classification and node movement regression. a multi-task graph convolutional neural network model (mt_gcnn) is developed to learn node removal and movement simultaneously. the model was evaluated with a map from stuttgart, germany that contains 8494 buildings generalized from the source scale of 1:5,000 to the target scale of 1:10,000. the experimental results show that the proposed method can generate 80% of the buildings with positional errors of less than 0.2 m, 95% with a shape difference under 0.5, and around 98% with an area difference under 0.1 of iou, compared to the ground truth target buildings, thus demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed method. the code is available at: https://github.com/chouisgiser/mapgeneralizer.",AB_0516
"acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging opportunistic pathogen. it exhibits multi-, extreme-, and pan-drug resistance against several classes of antibiotics. capsular polysaccharide (cps or k-antigen) is one of the major virulence factors which aids a. baumannii in evading the host immune system. k-antigens of a. baumannii exploit the wzx/wzy-dependent pathway that involves 13 different proteins for its assembly and transport onto the outer membrane. a total of 64 (out of 237 k-locus(kl) types) known k-antigen sugar repeating structures are discussed here and are classified into seven groups based on their initial sugars, quinac4nac, galnac, glcnac, gal, quinac/fucnac, fucnac, and glcnac along with leg5ac7ac/leg5ac7r. thus, the corresponding seven initializing glycosyltransferases (itra1, itra2, itra3, itra4, itrb1, itrb3, and itra3 along with itrb2) exhibit serotype specificity. the modeled 3d-structural repository of the 64 k-antigens can be accessed at https://project.iith.ac.in/absd/k_antigen.html. the topology of k-antigens further reveals the presence of 2-6 and 0-4 sugar monomers in the main and side chains, respectively. the presence of negatively (predominant) or neutrally charged k-antigens is observed in a. baumannii. such diversity in the k-antigen sugar composition provides the k-typing specificity (viz. , 18-69% in terms of reliability) for wza, wzb, wzc, wzx, and wzy proteins involved in the wzx/wzy-dependent pathway. interestingly, the degree of uniqueness of these proteins among different k-types is estimated to be 76.79%, considering the 237 reference sequences. this article summarizes the a. baumannii k-antigen structural diversity and creation of a k-antigen digital repository and provides a systematic analysis of the k-antigen assembly and transportation marker proteins.",AB_0516
"protein complexes are key functional units in cellular processes. high-throughput techniques, such as co-fractionation coupled with mass spectrometry (cf-ms), have advanced protein complex studies by enabling global interactome inference. however, dealing with complex fractionation characteristics to define true interactions is not a simple task, since cf-ms is prone to false positives due to the co-elution of non-interacting proteins by chance. several computational methods have been designed to analyze cf-ms data and construct probabilistic protein-protein interaction (ppi) networks. current methods usually first infer ppis based on handcrafted cf -ms features, and then use clustering algorithms to form potential protein complexes. while powerful, these methods suffer from the potential bias of handcrafted features and severely imbalanced data distribution. however, the handcrafted features based on domain knowledge might introduce bias, and current methods also tend to overfit due to the severely imbalanced ppi data. to address these issues, we present a balanced end-to-end learning architecture, software for prediction of interactome with feature-extraction free elution data (spiffed), to integrate feature representation from raw cf-ms data and interactome prediction by convolutional neural network. spiffed outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in predicting ppis under the conventional imbalanced training. when trained with balanced data, spiffed had greatly improved sensitivity for true ppis. moreover, the ensemble spiffed model provides different voting schemes to integrate predicted ppis from multiple cf-ms data. using the clustering software (i.e. clusterone), spiffed allows users to infer high-confidence protein complexes depending on the cf-ms experimental designs. the source code of spiffed is freely available at: https://github.com/bio-it-station/spiffed.",AB_0516
"poor chemical annotation of high-resolution mass spectrometry data limits applications of untargeted metabolomics datasets. our new software, the integrated data science laboratory for metabolomics and exposomics-composite spectra analysis (idsl.csa) r package, generates composite mass spectra libraries from ms1-only data, enabling the chemical annotation of high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography peaks regardless of the availability of ms2 fragmentation spectra. we demonstrate comparable annotation rates for commonly detected endogenous metabolites in human blood samples using idsl.csa libraries versus ms/ms libraries in validation tests. idsl.csa can create and search composite spectra libraries from any untargeted metabolomics dataset generated using highresolution mass spectrometry coupled to liquid or gas chromatography instruments. the crossapplicability of these libraries across independent studies may provide access to new biological insights that may be missed due to the lack of ms2 fragmentation data. the idsl.csa package is available in the r-cran repository at https://cran.r-project.org/package=idsl.csa. detailed documentation and tutorials are provided at https://github.com/idslme/idsl.csa.",AB_0516
"millions of people worldwide visit, live or work in the hypoxic environment encountered at high altitudes and it is important to understand the biomolecular responses to this stress. this would help design mitigation strategies for high altitude illnesses. in spite of a number of studies spanning over 100 years, still the complex mechanisms controlling acclimatization to hypoxia remain largely unknown. to identify potential diagnostic, therapeutic and predictive markers for ha stress, it is important to comprehensively compare and analyse these studies. towards this goal, highaltitudeomicsdb is a unique resource that provides a comprehensive, curated, user-friendly and detailed compilation of various genes/proteins which have been experimentally validated to be associated with various ha conditions, their protein-protein interactions (ppis) and gene ontology (go) semantic similarities. for each database entry, highaltitudeomicsdb additionally stores the level of regulation (up/down-regulation), fold change, study control group, duration and altitude of exposure, tissue of expression, source organism, level of hypoxia, method of experimental validation, place/country of study, ethnicity, geographical location etc. the database also collates information on disease and drug association, tissue-specific expression level, go and kegg pathway associations. the web resource is a unique server platform that offers interactive ppi networks and go semantic similarity matrices among the interactors.these unique features help to offer mechanistic insights into the disease pathology. hence, highaltitudeomicsdbis a unique platform for researchers working in this area to explore, fetch, compare and analyse ha-associated genes/proteins, their ppi networks, and go semantic similarities. the database is available at http://www.altitudeomicsdb.in.",AB_0516
"for classification problems, twin support vector machine with pinball loss (pin-gtsvm) is noise insensitive and has better performance than twin support vector machine (twsvm). however, it lacks sparsity in comparison to twsvm. in this article, to maintain a trade-off between the noise insensitivity and sparsity of the model along with preserving the theoretical properties of pinball loss, we propose universum twin support vector machine with truncated pinball loss (tpin-utwsvm). the proposed tpin-utwsvm considers universum data which gives prior information about the distribution of the data, thus improves the generalization performance of the proposed model. further, the proposed optimization problem is non-convex and non-differentiable which is solved by concave-convex procedure. we employed the sor approach to train the proposed model effectively with minimum training time. we conducted numerical experiments on 19 uci binary datasets with different noise levels to validate the noise insensitivity of the proposed tpin-utwsvm model. we also conducted numerical experiments for electroencephalogram (eeg) signal classification and alzheimer's disease (ad) detection. the overall experimental outcomes and statistical tests demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tpin-utwsvm model in comparison to the baseline models. the source code for the proposed tpin-utwsvm is available at https://github.com/mtanveer1/universum-twin-svm-with-truncated-pinball-loss.",AB_0516
