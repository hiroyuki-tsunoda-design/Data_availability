"ethnopharmacological relevance: terminalia arjuna (roxb. ex dc.) wight & arnot (combretaceae) is one of the most frequently used medicinal trees in indian traditional medicinal systems. it is used for the treatment of a variety of diseases including cardiovascular disorders. aim of the study: the purpose of this review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the phytochemistry, medicinal uses, toxicity, and industrial applications of t. arjuna bark (bta), as well as to identify gaps in research and applications of this important tree. it also aimed to analyze trends and future research paths to utilize the full potential of this tree. materials and methods: extensive bibliographic research on the t. arjuna tree was carried out using scientific research engines and databases such as google scholar, pubmed, and web of science, covering all relevant english-language articles. the database world flora online (wfo)(http://www.worldfloraonline.org) was used to confirm plant taxonomy. results: to date, bta has been traditionally employed for several disorders such as snakebites, scorpion stings, gleets, earaches, dysentery, sexual disorders, and urinary tract infections along with the cardioprotective activity. about 38 phytocompounds were identified from bta and were classified as triterpenoids, tannins, flavonoids, and glycosides. a wide range of in vitro and in vivo pharmacological effects of bta were reported such as anti-cancer, antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, anti-allergic, anti-diabetic, and wound healing activities. the oral administration of bta (500 mg/kg) per day did not result in any toxicity in humans. the in vivo acute and sub-acute toxicity analysis of the methanol extract of bta and one of its major compounds, 7-methyl gallate, did not produce any adverse effects up to a dose of 1000 mg/kg. conclusions: this comprehensive review highlights various aspects of traditional knowledge, phytochemicals, and pharmacological significance of bta. the review covered safety information on employing bta in pharma-ceutical dosage forms. despite its long history of medicinal benefit, more studies are needed to understand the molecular mechanisms, structure-activity relationship, and potential synergistic and antagonistic effects of its phytocompounds, drug administration, drug-drug interactions, and toxicological effects.",AB_0429
"rapid and precise segmentation of breast tumors is a severe challenge for the global research community to diagnose breast cancer in younger females. an ultrasound system is a non-invasive and efficient way of breast screening. the area, shape, and texture of different breast tumors play a vital role for clinicians in making accurate diagnostic decisions. furthermore, the limited availability of breast tumor annotated datasets is another challenge for properly training deep neural networks. this research proposes a semi-supervised learning-based method, which incorporates a data expansion network (den), probability map generator network (pmg), and ushaped pyramid-dilated fusion network (pdf-unet) for accurate breast tumor segmentation. the first den network is trained on breast unannotated tumor images and generates synthetic images for the data expansion task. the second pmg network generates corresponding probability map images against synthetic unannotated images. finally, we proposed a segmentation network (pdf-unet), a modified variant of unet, to segment the breast tumor images. the results demonstrate that compared with classical unet, our proposed pdf-unet achieves an increment of dsc (2.42%) on the mendeley dataset and an increment of dsc (1.52%) observed on the siit dataset. the results reflect that the proposed method is effective when annotated breast ultrasound data is insufficient to train the network. furthermore, the proposed method can be helpful in relieving the annotation burden of radiologists. the implementation source code is available at github: https://github.com/ahmedeqbal/ pdf-unet.",AB_0429
"deep neural networks have become very popular for solving many problems in computer vision. super-resolution (sr) is a particularly challenging task since new information must be created at increased resolution, possibly leading to visual artefacts or incoherent texture. in the context of remote sensing, this image restoration technique has great potential for synthesizing high-resolution (hr) data from low-resolution (lr) images. while there are multiple methods that enhance the perceptual quality of sr images, most of them fail to recover detailed information from aerial imagery. one of the main reasons for that is the difficulty in defining a 'good-looking' image from the perspective of the machine. in this work, we propose an end-to-end training procedure that unifies networks related to different tasks: an sr module based on generative adversarial networks (gans) and a semantic segmentation module. our claim is that by including a classification loss when estimating the hr image, the gan generator produces more coherent structures and textural information, synthesizing, therefore, more realistic images according to perception-based scores. our experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of improving perceptual outputs of deep-learning oriented networks with a small training overhead, surpassing multiple state-of-the-art super-resolution methods. our code is available at http://github.com/elitonfilho/segsr.",AB_0429
"loss of sqstm1/p62 leads to adipose tissue dysfunction and mature-onset obesity in mice. loss of sqstm1/p62 leads to brown adipose tissue maladaptation to alcohol consumption resulting in more severe liver injury.background: alcohol-associated liver disease (ald) is a worldwide health problem, of which the effective treatment is still lacking. both detrimental and protective roles of adipose tissue have been implicated in ald. although alcohol increases adipose tissue lipolysis to promote alcohol-induced liver injury, alcohol also activates brown adipose tissue (bat) thermogen-esis as an adaptive response in protecting against alcohol -induced liver injury. moreover, aging and obesity are also risk factors for ald. in the present study, we investigated the effects of autophagy receptor protein sqstm1/p62 on adipose tissue and obesity in alcohol-induced liver injury in both young and aged mice.methods: young and aged whole-body sqstm1/p62 knockout (ko) and their age-matched wild-type (wt) mice were subjected to chronic plus binge (gao-binge) alcohol feeding. blood, adipose and liver tissues were collected for biochemical and histologic analysis.results: aged but not young sqstm1/p62 ko mice had significantly increased body weight and fat mass compared with the matched wt mice. gao-binge alcohol feeding induced white adipose atrophy and decreased levels of sqstm1/p62 levels in adipose tissue in aged wt mice. sqstm1/p62 ko aged mice were resistant to gao-binge alcohol-induced white adipose atrophy. alcohol feeding increased the expression of thermogenic genes in wt mouse bat, which was significantly blunted in sqstm1/p62 ko aged mice. alcohol-fed aged sqstm1/p62 ko mice showed significantly higher levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, hepatic triglyceride, and inflammation compared with young and aged wt mice fed with alcohol. alcohol-fed sqstm1/p62 ko mice also increased secretion of proinflammatory and angiogenic adipokines that may promote alcohol-induced liver injury.conclusions: loss of sqstm1/p62 in aged mice leads to obesity and impairs alcohol-induced bat adaptation, resulting in exacerbated alcohol-induced liver injury in mice.

"background achondroplasia, caused by a pathogenic variant in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene, is the most common skeletal dysplasia. the lifetime impact of achondroplasia study in europe (liaise; nct03449368) aimed to quantify the burden of achondroplasia among individuals across a broad range of ages, including adults.methods demographic, clinical and healthcare resource use data were collected from medical records of achondro-plasia patients enrolled in 13 sites across six european countries in this retrospective, observational study. descriptive statistics or event rates per 100 person-years were calculated and compared across age groups as well as by history of limb lengthening. patient-reported outcomes (quality of life [qol], pain, functional independence, work productiv-ity and activity impairments) were evaluated using questionnaires at the time of enrolment. an exploratory analysis investigated correlations between height (z-score or centimetres) and patient-reported outcomes.results overall, 186 study patients were included, with a mean age of 21.7 +/- 17.3 years (range 5.0-84.4). at least one complication or surgery was reported for 94.6% and 72.0% of patients, respectively, at a rate of 66.6 and 21.5 events per 100 person-years. diverse medical and surgical complications were reported for all ages in a bimodal distribution, occurring more frequently in the youngest and oldest age groups. a total of 40 patients had previously undergone limb lengthening (capped at 20% per the study protocol). the most frequent surgery types varied by age, in line with complication profiles. healthcare resource use was high across all age groups, especially among the youngest and oldest individuals, and did not differ substantially according to history of limb lengthening. compared to general population values, patients reported impaired qol particularly for physical functioning domains. in addition, patients reported difficulty carrying out daily activities independently and pain starting in childhood. patient height correlated with multiple patient-reported outcomes.conclusions the findings of this study suggest that, across an individual's lifetime, achondroplasia is associated with multisystem complications, reduced qol and functionality, and increased pain. these results highlight the large amount of healthcare resources that individuals with achondroplasia require throughout their lifespans and provide novel insights into current achondroplasia management practices across europe. trial registration clinicaltrials.gov, nct03449368, submitted 14 december 2017 - prospectively registered, https:// clini caltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/nct03449368",AB_0429
"objective investigate effects of gender on disease characteristics and treatment impact in patients with psa.methods psabio is a non-interventional european study in patients with psa starting a biological dmard [bdmard; ustekinumab or tnf inhibitor (tnfi)]. this post-hoc analysis compared persistence, disease activity, patient-reported outcomes and safety between male and female patients at baseline and 6 and 12 months of treatment.results at baseline, disease duration was 6.7 and 6.9 years for 512 females and 417 males respectively. mean (95% ci) scores for females vs males were: clinical disease activity index for psoriatic arthritis (cdapsa), 32.3 (30.3, 34.2) vs 26.8 (24.8, 28.9); haq-disability index (haq-di), 1.3 (1.2, 1.4) vs 0.93 (0.86, 0.99); total psa impact of disease-12 (psaid-12) score, 6.0 (5.8, 6.2) vs 5.1 (4.9, 5.3), respectively. improvements in scores were smaller in female than male patients. at 12 months, 175/303 (57.8%) female and 212/264 (80.3%) male patients achieved cdapsa low disease activity, 96/285 (33.7%) and 137/247 (55.5%), achieved minimal disease activity (mda), respectively. haq-di scores were 0.85 (0.77, 0.92) vs 0.50 (0.43, 0.56), psaid-12 scores 3.5 (3.3, 3.8) vs 2.4 (2.2, 2.6), respectively. treatment persistence was lower in females than males (p <= 0.001). lack of effectiveness was the predominant reason to stop, irrespective of gender and bdmard.conclusions before starting bdmards, females had more severe disease than males and a lower percentage reached favourable disease states, with lower persistence of treatment after 12 months. a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these differences may improve therapeutic management in females with psa.trial registration clinicaltrials.gov, https://clinicaltrials.gov, nct02627768",AB_0429
"robotic-assisted technology has proven to enhance the accuracy of bone resection and implant placement. however, robotic-assisted technology suffers from slow speed and high cost. moreover, usually surgeries require the performance of radioactive scans. therefore, the aim of this research is to build a low-cost autonomous system to perform ruka (robotic unicompartmental knee arthroplasty). a novel image-free registration process has been developed to eliminate the need for radioactive scans. additionally, a cnc machine was built to perform autonomous resec-tion. the proposed system was tested on a set of artificial tibia bones, and analysing their surfaces of the proposed system on the tibia bones was compared to mako and bluebelt systems. mean error of the tibial resections was 1.9 mm compared to 2.87 mm for the mako system, and 3.07 mm for the bluebelt. the maximum error for the proposed system was 2.9 mm compared to 4.99 mm in the mako and 4.5 mm in bluebelt. to access the code, click here https://github.com/omarshalash/tel esurgeryautonomouscontrol.git (c) 2023 the authors. published by elsevier bv on behalf of faculty of engineering, alexandria university. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ( licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0429
"accurate classification of the type of brain tumor plays an important role in the early diagnosis of the tumor which can be the difference between life and death. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is commonly used to capture high-contrast grayscale images of the brain and is a non-invasive method for brain tumor diagnosis. deep learning (dl) using convolutional neural networks (cnn) has revolutionized computer aided diagnostic (cad) systems by producing remarkable results for various medical imaging analysis tasks including brain tumor detection. in this research, a transfer learning-based fine-tuning approach for the classification of brain tumors into three classes i.e. glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumor using efficientnets is carried out. five variants of pre-trained models from the efficientnets family i.e. efficientnetb0 - efficientnetb4 are fine-tuned on publically available ce-mri figshare - brain tumor dataset. the proposed method of fine-tuning pre-trained efficientnet is carried out by first loading imagenet weights to the efficientnet model followed by the addition of several top layers and a fully connected layer for the classification of brain tumor types. several experiments are carried out to analyze the robustness of the proposed fine-tuned efficientnets in comparison to other pre-trained models. moreover, the effect of data augmentation on the model's test accuracy is also studied. finally, the grad-cam visualization of the attention maps of the best model is presented that successfully highlights the tumorous region of the brain cell. the proposed method of fine-tuning pre-trained efficientnet showed significant performance using efficientnetb2 as a backbone achieving overall test accuracy, precision, recall/sensitivity, and f1score of 98.86%, 98.65%, 98.77%, and 98.71% respectively. the proposed fine-tuned efficientnetb2 is lightweight, computationally inexpensive (during training and inference), and generalizes well. the source code is available at https://github.com/fatimazulfiqar/multi-class-brain-tumor-classification.",AB_0429
"tuberculosis still significantly impacts the world's population, with more than 10 million people getting sick each year. researchers have focused on developing computer-aided diagnosis (cad) technology based on x-ray imaging to support the identification of tuberculosis, and deep learning is a popular and efficient method. however, deep learning-based cad approaches usually ignore the relationship between the two vision tasks of specific region segmentation and classification. in this research, we introduced a novel tb-unet, which is based on dilated fusion block (df) and attention block (ab) block for accurate segmentation of lungs regions and achieved the highest results in terms of precision (0.9574), recall (0.9512), and f1score (0.8988), iou (0.8168) and accuracy (0.9770). we also proposed tb-densenet which is based on five dual convolution blocks, densenet-169 layer, and a feature fusion block for the precise classification of tuberculosis images. the exper-iments have been performed on three chest x-ray (cxr) datasets, segmented images, and original images are fed to tb-densenet for better classification. furthermore, the proposed method is tested against simultaneously three different diseases, such as pneumonia, covid-19, and tuberculous. the highest results are achieved in terms of precision (0.9567), recall (0.9510), f1score (0.9538), and accuracy (0.9510). the achieved results reflect that our proposed method produces the highest accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods. the source code is available at: https://github.com/ahmedeqbal/tb-densenet.",AB_0429
