"background: chronic hand and foot eczema is a polyetiological dermatological condition. patients experience pain, itching, and sleep disturbances and have a reduced quality of life. skin care programs and patient education can improve the clinical outcome. ehealth devices offer a new opportunity to better inform and monitor patients.objective: this study aimed to systematically analyze the effect of a monitoring smartphone app combined with patient education on the quality of life and clinical outcome of patients with hand and foot eczema.methods: patients in the intervention group received an educational program; attended study visits on weeks 0, 12, and 24; and had access to the study app. patients in the control group attended the study visits only. the primary end point was a statistically significant reduction in dermatology life quality index, pruritus, and pain at weeks 12 and 24. the secondary end point was a statistically significant reduction in the modified hand eczema severity index (hecsi) score at weeks 12 and 24. this is an interim analysis at week 24 of the 60-week randomized controlled study.results: in total, 87 patients were included in the study and randomized to the intervention group (n=43, 49%) or control group (n=44, 51%). of the 87 patients, 59 (68%) completed the study visit at week 24. there were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups regarding quality of life, pain, itch, activity, and clinical outcome at weeks 12 and 24. subgroup analysis revealed that, compared with the control group, the intervention group with an app use frequency of fewer than once every 5 weeks had a significant improvement in the dermatology life quality index at weeks 12 (p=.001) and 24 (p=.05), in pain measured on a numeric rating scale at weeks 12 (p=.02) and 24 (p=.02), and in the hecsi score at week 12 (p=.02). in addition, the hecsi scores assessed on the basis of pictures taken by the patients of their hands and feet correlated strongly with the hecsi scores recorded by physicians during regular personal visits (r=0.898; p=.002) even when the quality of the images was not that good.conclusions: an educational program combined with a monitoring app that connects patients with their treating dermatologists can improve quality of life if the app is not used too frequently. in addition, telemedical care can at least partially replace personal care in patients with hand and foot eczema because the analysis of the pictures taken by the patients correlates strongly with that of the in vivo images. a monitoring app such as the one presented in this study has the potential to improve patient care and should be implemented in daily practice.trial registration: deutsches register klinischer studien drks00020963; https://drks.de/search/de/trial/drks00020963 (jmir mhealth uhealth 2023;11:e38506) doi: 10.2196/38506",AB_0504
"humans can robustly recognize and localize objects by using visual and/or auditory cues. while machines are able to do the same with visual data already, less work has been done with sounds. this work develops an approach for scene understanding purely based on binaural sounds. the considered tasks include predicting the semantic masks of sound-making objects, the motion of sound-making objects, and the depth map of the scene. to this aim, we propose a novel sensor setup and record a new audio-visual dataset of street scenes with eight professional binaural microphones and a 360$\mathrm{<^>{\circ }}$& lcirc;camera. the co-existence of visual and audio cues is leveraged for supervision transfer. in particular, we employ a cross-modal distillation framework that consists of multiple vision 'teacher' methods and a sound 'student' method - the student method is trained to generate the same results as the teacher methods do. this way, the auditory system can be trained without using human annotations. to further boost the performance, we propose another novel auxiliary task, coined spatial sound super-resolution, to increase the directional resolution of sounds. we then formulate the four tasks into one end-to-end trainable multi-tasking network aiming to boost the overall performance. experimental results show that 1) our method achieves good results for all four tasks, 2) the four tasks are mutually beneficial - training them together achieves the best performance, 3) the number and orientation of microphones are both important, and 4) features learned from the standard spectrogram and features obtained by the classic signal processing pipeline are complementary for auditory perception tasks. the data and code are released on the project page: https://www.trace.ethz.ch/publications/2020/sound_perception/index.html.",AB_0504
"analyzingmass spectrometry-based proteomics data with deep learning (dl) approaches poses several challenges due to the high dimensionality, low sample size, and high level of noise. additionally, dl-based workflows are often hindered to be integrated into medical settings due to the lack of interpretable explanation. we presentdlearnms, a dl biomarker detection framework, to address these challenges on proteomics instances of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms) - a well-established tool for quantifying complex proteinmixtures. ourdlearnms framework learns the clinical state of lc-ms data instances using convolutional neural networks. based on the trained neural networks, we show how biomarkers can be identified using layer-wise relevance propagation. this enables detecting discriminating regions of the data and the design ofmore robust networks. one of themain advantages over other establishedmethods is that no explicit preprocessing step is needed in our dlearnms framework. our evaluation shows that dlearnms outperforms conventional lc-ms biomarker detection approaches in identifying fewer false positive peakswhilemaintaining a comparable amount of true positives peaks. code availability: the code is available fromthe following gitrepository: https://github.com/sahariravani/dlearnms",AB_0504
"motivation the steady increment of whole genome/exome sequencing and the development of novel next generation sequencing-based gene panels requires continuous testing and validation of variant calling (vc) pipelines and the detection of sequencing-related issues to be maintained up-to-date and feasible for the clinical settings. state of the art tools are reliable when used to compute standard performance metrics. however, the need for an automated software to discriminate between bioinformatic and sequencing issues and to optimize vc parameters remains unmet.results the aim of the current work is to present recallme, a bioinformatic suite that tracks down difficult-to-detect variants as insertions and deletions in highly repetitive regions, thus providing the maximum reachable recall for both single nucleotide variants and small insertion and deletions and to precisely guide the user in the pipeline optimization process.availability and implementation source code is freely available under mit license at https://github.com/mazzalab-ieo/recallme. recallme web application is available at https://translational-oncology-lab.shinyapps.io/recallme/. to use recallme, users must obtain a license for annovar by themselves.",AB_0504
"backgroundthere is a paucity of studies which have examined associations between ultrasound based fetal anthropometric parameters and neurodevelopment in all infants. we examined the association between ultrasound based fetal anthropometric parameters and neurodevelopment in all infants through a secondary analysis of data collected in a large community based randomized controlled trial.methodsa total of 1465 mother-child dyads were included. ultrasound based fetal anthropometric parameters which included the head circumference (hc), abdominal circumference (ac), femur length (fl), biparietal diameter (bpd) and transcerebellar diameter (tcd) were collected at 26-28 weeks of gestation and their association with neurodevelopment at 24 months of age was examined.resultsonly the transcerebellar diameter z score was positively associated +0.54 units (95% ci: 0.15, 0.93) with motor composite score. when the neurodevelopment outcomes were analyzed as categorical, none of the fetal variables were associated with risk of moderate to severe neurodevelopment impairment.conclusionthe findings suggest that transcerebellar diameter could be useful for early prediction of neurodevelopmental outcomes in childhood.clinical trial registrationclinical trial registration of women and infants integrated interventions for growth study clinical trial registry-india, #ctri/2017/06/008908; registered on: 23/06/2017, (http://ctri.nic.in/clinicaltrials/pmaindet2.php?trialid=19339&enchid=&username=society%20for%20applied%20studies).",AB_0504
"the profusion of sequenced genomes across the bacterial and archeal domains offers unprecedented possibilities for phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses. in general, phylogenetic reconstruction is improved by the use of more data. however, including all available data is (i) not computationally tractable, and (ii) prone to biases, as the abundance of genomes is very unequally distributed over the biological diversity. thus, in most cases, subsampling taxa to build a phylogeny is necessary. currently, though, there is no available software to perform that handily. here we present tada, a taxonomic-aware dataset selection workflow that allows sampling across user-defined portions of the prokaryotic diversity with variable granularity, while setting constraints on genome quality and balance between branches. availability and implementation: tada is implemented as a snakemake workflow and is freely available at https://github.com/emilhaegglund/tada.",AB_0504
"foot-and-mouth disease (fmd) is a severe contagious viral disease of cloven-hoofed animals. in india, a vaccination-based official fmd control programme was started, which got expanded progressively to cover entire country in 2019. the serological tests are used to determine non-structural protein based sero-prevalence rates for properly implementing and assessing the control programme. since 2008, reporting of the fmd sero-surveillance was limited to the serum sample-based serological test results without going for population-level estimation due to lack of proper statistical methodology. thus, we present a computational approach for estimating the sero-prevalence rates at the state and national levels. based on the reported approach, a web-application (https://nifmd-bbf.icar.gov.in/fmdserosurv) and an r software package (https://github.com/sam-dfmd/fmdserosurv) have been developed. the presented computational techniques are applied to the fmd sero-surveillance data during 2008-2021 to get the status of virus circulation in india under a strict vaccination policy. furthermore, through various structural equation models, we attempt to establish a link between india's estimated sero-prevalence rate and field fmd outbreaks. our results indicate that the current sero-prevalence rates are significantly associated with previous field outbreaks up to 2 years. besides, we observe downward trends in sero-prevalence and outbreaks over the years, specifically after 2013, which indicate the effectiveness of various measures implemented under the fmd control programme. the findings of the study may help researchers and policymakers to track virus infection and identification of potential disease-free zones through vaccination.",AB_0504
"we argue that the recently discovered bilinear superintegrability http://arxiv.org/2206.02045 generalizes, in a non-trivial way, to monomial matrix models in pure phase. the structure is much richer: for the trivial core schur functions required modifications are minor, and the only new ingredient is a certain (contour-dependent) permutation matrix; for non-trivial-core schur functions, in both bi-linear and tri-linear averages the deformation is more complicated: averages acquire extra n-dependent factors and selection rule is less straightforward to imply.",AB_0504
"background garcinol is a naturally occurring compound from the fruit rind of the garcinia indica, with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. curcuminoids are the active molecule from the rhizome of curcuma longa, studied extensively for its health benefits as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) is the progressive form of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis characterized by liver fat and inflammation.objective to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of garcinol, curcuminoids and piperine (gcp) combination in patients with mild to moderate nash in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.methods the patients received one tablet (450 mg) of gcp containing garcinol-50 mg, curcuminoids -250 mg and piperine 5 mg or a placebo (450 mg of microcrystalline cellulose) twice daily for 90 days. changes in circulating aspartate aminotransferase (ast), alanine transaminase (alt) levels, liver stiffness measurement (lsm), and controlled attenuation parameter (cap) using fibroscan were compared from baseline to day 90. anthropometric parameters, serum levels of lipids, interleukin (il-6), hscrp, and adiponectin were estimated. safety was evaluated by laboratory parameters and by monitoring adverse events.results seventy-two patients were randomized and 63 (gcp = 32, placebo = 31) completed the study. the mean age of the patients was 48.3 +/- 8.7 years (36 males and 27 females). the mean reduction in ast (u/l) was 9.53 in gcp and 3.16 in placebo (p < 0.001) and that of alt (u/l) was 13.47 in gcp and 7.43 in placebo (p = 0.002). the liver stiffness and cap scores showed a better reduction in gcp (0.56 kpa and 12.38 db/m) compared to placebo (0.064 kpa and 10.42 db/m) p < 0.05. consequently, the noninvasive fibroscan-ast (fast) score reduction was also found to be significant in gcp compared to placebo. additionally, body weight, lipid levels, hscrp, and il-6 in serum decreased, while adiponectin levels increased in gcp-supplemented participants compared to placebo. the combination of garcinol and curcuminoids was well tolerated with no significant changes in hematological and clinical laboratory parameters during the 90-day supplementation.conclusion our results suggest that gcp could be a possible supplement for the management of nash. clinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier ctri/2019/11/022147.conclusion our results suggest that gcp could be a possible supplement for the management of nash. clinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier ctri/2019/11/022147.",AB_0504
"with new advances in next generation sequencing (ngs) technology at reduced costs, research on bacterial genomes in the environment has become affordable. compared to traditional methods, ngs provides high-throughput sequencing reads and the ability to identify many species in the microbiome that were previously unknown. numerous bioinformatics tools and algorithms have been developed to conduct such analyses. however, in order to obtain biologically meaningful results, the researcher must select the proper tools and combine them to construct an efficient pipeline. this complex procedure may include tens of tools, each of which require correct parameter settings. furthermore, an ngs data analysis involves multiple series of command-line tools and requires extensive computational resources, which imposes a high barrier for biologists and clinicians to conduct ngs analysis and even interpret their own data. therefore, we established a public gut microbiome database, which we call twnbiome, created using healthy subjects from taiwan, with the goal of enabling microbiota research for the taiwanese population. twnbiome provides users with a baseline gut microbiome panel from a healthy taiwanese cohort, which can be utilized as a reference for conducting case-control studies for a variety of diseases. it is an interactive, informative, and user-friendly database. twnbiome additionally offers an analysis pipeline, where users can upload their data and download analyzed results. twnbiome offers an online database which non-bioinformatics users such as clinicians and doctors can not only utilize to access a control set of data, but also analyze raw data with a few easy clicks. all results are customizable with ready-made plots and easily downloadable tables. database url: http://twnbiome.cgm.ntu.edu.tw/.",AB_0504
