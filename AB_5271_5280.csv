"motivation the balanced minimum evolution (bme) is a powerful distance based phylogenetic estimation model introduced by desper and gascuel and nowadays implemented in popular tools for phylogenetic analyses. it was proven to be computationally less demanding than more sophisticated estimation methods, e.g. maximum likelihood or bayesian inference while preserving the statistical consistency and the ability to run with almost any kind of data for which a dissimilarity measure is available. bme can be stated in terms of a nonlinear non-convex combinatorial optimization problem, usually referred to as the balanced minimum evolution problem (bmep). currently, the state-of-the-art among approximate methods for the bmep is represented by fastme (version 2.0), a software which implements several deterministic phylogenetic construction heuristics combined with a local search on specific neighbourhoods derived by classical topological tree rearrangements. these combinations, however, may not guarantee convergence to close-to-optimal solutions to the problem due to the lack of solution space exploration, a phenomenon which is exacerbated when tackling molecular datasets characterized by a large number of taxa.results to overcome such convergence issues, in this article, we propose a novel metaheuristic, named phyloes, which exploits the combination of an exploration phase based on evolution strategies, a special type of evolutionary algorithm, with a refinement phase based on two local search algorithms. extensive computational experiments show that phyloes consistently outperforms fastme, especially when tackling larger datasets, providing solutions characterized by a shorter tree length but also significantly different from the topological perspective.availability and implementation the software and the data are available at https://github.com/andygaspar/phyloes.",AB_0528
"the pooling layer used in cnn models aims to reduce the resolution of image/feature maps while retaining their distinctive information, reducing computation time and enabling deeper models. max and average pooling methods are frequently used in cnn models due to their computational efficiency; however, these methods discard the position information of the pixels. in this study, we proposed an lbp-based pooling method that generates a neighborhood-based output for any pixel, reflecting the correlation between pixels in the local area. our proposed method reduces information loss since it considers the neighborhood and size of the pixels in the pooling region. experimental studies were performed on four public datasets to assess the effectiveness of the lbp pooling method. in experimental studies, a toy cnn model and various transfer learning models were utilized in conducting test operations. the proposed method provided improvements of 1.56% for fashion mnist, 0.22% for mnist, 3.95% for cifar10, and 5% for cifar100 dataset using the toy model. in the experimental studies conducted using the transfer learning model, performance improvements of 6.99(-/+)(0.74) and 8.3(-/+)(0.1) were achieved for cifar10 and cifar100, respectively. we observed that the proposed method outperforms the commonly used pooling layers in cnn models. code for this paper can be publicly accessed at: https://github.com/cuneytozdemir/lbppooling",AB_0528
"post-hoc explanation methods (such as importance estimators and saliency maps) attempt to make the inner workings of deep neural networks (dnns) more comprehensible and trustworthy, which otherwise act as black box models. however, since a ground truth is in general lacking, local post-hoc explanation methods, which assign importance scores to input features, are challenging to evaluate. one of the most popular evaluation frameworks is to perturb features deemed important by an explanation and to measure the change in prediction accuracy. intuitively, a large decrease in prediction accuracy would indicate that the explanation has correctly quantified the importance of features with respect to the prediction outcome (e.g., logits). however, the change in the prediction outcome may stem from perturbation artifacts, since perturbed samples in the test dataset are out of distribution (ood) compared to the training dataset and can therefore potentially disturb the model in an unexpected manner. to overcome this challenge, we propose feature perturbation augmentation (fpa) which creates and adds perturbed images during the model training. using three different datasets and several importance estimators, our computational experiments demonstrate that fpa makes dnns more robust against perturbations. during evaluation, we considered model accuracy curves obtained from perturbing input features according to most important first (mif) and least important first (lif) orders, which are quantitatively summarized as fidelity metrics. additionally, our results suggest that frequently observed fluctuations in the sign of importance scores describe the model characteristics rather accurately if perturbation artifacts are suppressed by fpa. overall, fpa is an intuitive and straightforward data augmentation technique that renders the evaluation of post-hoc explanations more trustworthy. reproducible codes and pre-trained models with fpa are available on github: https://github.com/lenbrocki/ feature-perturbation-augmentation.",AB_0528
"aim: this study aimed to investigate the effects of topical liposomal clarithromycin in combination with meglumine antimoniate (glucantime (r)) on cutaneous leishmaniasis (cl) lesions.methods: this pilot, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial was conducted on patients with cl lesions. patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the first group received liposomal clarithromycin in combination with glucantime for 28 days, while the second group received glucantime and a placebo. afterward, patients were followed up at 1.5, 3, and 6 months after treatment initiation and were evaluated for recovery time, induration, and size of the lesions.results: sixty patients with cl lesions were divided into two separate groups with 30 members each and were examined. within-group analysis revealed that recovery time in the clarithromycin group was 26.65 +/- 5.12 days, while in the placebo group, it was 32.84 +/- 24.43, which was statistically insignificant (p = 0.18). lesion size comparison in the first and last follow-ups reduced in both groups: 7.73 +/- 4.31 to 0.48 +/- 0.50 in the clarithromycin group (p = 0.006) and 5.47 +/- 5.83 to 0.76 +/- 0.88 in the placebo group (p = 0.03). moreover, the size of lesions in the intervention group was significantly reduced compared to that in the placebo group (p = 0.02). recognizable induration reduction was observed in the clarithromycin group (2.60 +/- 0.77 to 1.0 +/- 0.00). no adverse effects attributable to clarithromycin were reported.conclusion: the administration of liposomal clarithromycin in combination with systemic glucantime had a significant beneficial effect on reducing lesion size in leishmaniasis. further studies on larger populations are recommended.systematic review registration: https://www.irct.ir/trial/46611.",AB_0528
"motivation: molecular quantitative trait locus (qtl) mapping has proven to be a powerful approach for prioritizing genetic regulatory variants and causal genes identified by genome-wide association studies. recently, this success has been extended to circular rna (circrna), a potential group of rnas that can serve as markers for the diagnosis, prognosis, or therapeutic targets of various human diseases. however, a well-developed computational pipeline for circrna qtl (circqtl) discovery is still lacking. results: we introduce an integrative method for circqtl mapping and implement it as an automated pipeline based on nextflow, named cscqtl. the proposed method has two main advantages. firstly, cscqtl improves the specificity by systematically combining outputs of multiple circrna calling algorithms to obtain highly confident circrna annotations. secondly, cscqtl improves the sensitivity by accurately quantifying circrna expression with the help of pseudo references. compared to the single method approach, cscqtl effectively identifies circqtls with an increase of 20%-100% circqtls detected and recovered all circqtls that are highly supported by the single method approach. we apply cscqtl to a dataset of human t cells and discover genetic variants that control the expression of 55 circrnas. by colocalization tests, we further identify circbach2 and circyy1ap1 as potential candidates for immune disease regulation. availability and implementation: cscqtl is freely available at: https://github.com/datngu/cscqtl and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7851982.",AB_0528

"hand gesture recognition(hgr) is a challenging computer vision task. recently, by taking advantages of deep learning-based models, hgr methods have achieved outstanding results and outperformed state-of-the-art alternatives by a high margin. however, the performance of deep learning-based models is highly dependent on the data. a large amount of data is required to train deep learning-based models. while there are some widely-used datasets in hgr, these datasets lack diverse gestures in real-world situations. to this end, we propose a hand gesture dataset (dataset will be publicly available after paper publication.), including diverse gestures with more sample numbers per gesture class. furthermore, we provide hand annotations, including a hand bounding box, 3d hand keypoints, and gesture label per sample. the proposed dataset aims to provide a benchmark for research works to tackle real-world situations. the dataset samples are recorded in a real-world background with high complexity and diversity. to be more realistic, the proposed dataset does not include any pre-processing step. all of the samples in this dataset are pure and real. this configuration makes room to underpin future research works in a real-world situation and develop gesture recognition models in an unrestricted environment. overall, our dataset outperforms in terms of diversity, number of subjects, number of samples per gesture class, and use of real data. finally, different analysis on the existing state-of-the-art models in hgr, hpe, hand recovery, and hand reconstruction were performed and reported. our implementation is available at https://github.com/smohammadi96/diverse_hand_gesture_dataset/blob/main/readme.md.",AB_0528

"objective posttraumatic hydrocephalus (pth) is a recognized long-term complication of traumatic brain injury (tbi). the authors assessed the incidence and risk factors of pth and its association with outcome in patients with tbi who were treated in the intensive care unit (icu). methods the authors used the finnish intensive care consortium (ficc) database to retrospectively identify all adult patients with tbi treated in 4 finnish tertiary icus during 2003-2013. all patients were followed up from hospital dis-charge to a diagnosis of pth, death, or the end of 2016. pth was defined as a need for a postdischarge ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculoatrial shunt. the authors collected data on shunt-insertion procedures, mortality, and disability status from nationwide registries cross-linked to the ficc database. the authors calculated the occurrence and incidence rates of pth and used multivariable logistic regression modeling to determine risk factors for pth and its association with outcome. results sixty-one of 2882 patients (2.1%) developed pth during a median follow-up time of 4.6 years, with a median of 102 days (interquartile range 54-220 days) between hospital discharge and pth. risk factors for pth were increas-ing age (or 1.02 per year, 95% ci 1.01-1.04); a midline shift of > 5 mm (or 1.88, 95% ci 1.01-3.48); traumatic sub-arachnoid hemorrhage (or 3.59, 95% ci 1.79-7.21); external ventricular drainage (or 3.54, 95% ci 1.68-7.46); and decompressive craniectomy (or 3.68, 95% ci 1.37-9.88). pth was independently associated with permanent disability after case-mix adjustment (or 3.62, 95% ci 2.11-6.22). conclusions pth is an uncommon long-term complication of tbi, with several risk factors that are identifiable early during neurointensive care. the development of pth is independently associated with poor functional outcome. whether earlier detection and treatment of pth leads to improved outcomes remains unknown, highlighting the importance of adequate follow-up and prompt detection and treatment of the condition. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2023.2.jns22728",AB_0528
