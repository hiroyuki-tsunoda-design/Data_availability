"multiplexed dna fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) imaging technologies have been developed to map the folding of chromatin fibers at tens of nanometers and up to several kilobases in resolution in single cells. however, computational methods to reliably identify chromatin loops from such imaging datasets are still lacking. here we present a single-nucleus analysis pipeline for multiplexed dna fish (snapfish), to process the multiplexed dna fish data and identify chromatin loops. snapfish can identify known chromatin loops from mouse embryonic stem cells with high sensitivity and accuracy. in addition, snapfish obtains comparable results of chromatin loops across datasets generated from diverse imaging technologies. snapfish is freely available at https://github.com/huminglab/snapfish.",AB_0605
"motivation: the emergence of high-throughput experiments and high-resolution computational predictions has led to an explosion in the quality and volume of protein sequence annotations at proteomic scales. unfortunately, sanity checking, integrating, and analyzing complex sequence annotations remains logistically challenging and introduces a major barrier to entry for even superficial integrative bioinformatics. results: to address this technical burden, we have developed shephard, a python framework that trivializes large-scale integrative protein bioinformatics. shephard combines an object-oriented hierarchical data structure with database-like features, enabling programmatic annotation, integration, and analysis of complex datatypes. importantly shephard is easy to use and enables a pythonic interrogation of largescale protein datasets with millions of unique annotations. we use shephard to examine three orthogonal proteome-wide questions relating protein sequence to molecular function, illustrating its ability to uncover novel biology. availability and implementation: we provided shephard as both a stand-alone software package (https://github.com/holehouse-lab/shep hard), and as a google colab notebook with a collection of precomputed proteome-wide annotations (https://github.com/holehouse-lab/shep hard-colab).",AB_0605
"the exon-junction complex (ejc) plays a role in post-transcriptional gene regulation and exerts antiviral activity towards several positive-strand rna viruses. however, the spectrum of rna viruses that are tar-geted by the ejc or the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. ejc components from ara-bidopsis thaliana were screened for antiviral activity towards turnip crinkle virus (tcv, tombusviridae). overexpression of the accessory ejc component casc3 inhibited tcv accumulation > 10-fold in nico-tiana benthamiana while knock-down of endogenous casc3 resulted in a > 4-fold increase in tcv accu-mulation. casc3 forms cytoplasmic condensates and deletion of the conserved selor domain reduced condensate size 7-fold and significantly decreased antiviral activity towards tcv. mass spectrometry of casc3 complexes did not identify endogenous stress granule or p-body markers and casc3 failed to co-localize with an aggresome-specific dye suggesting that casc3 condensates are distinct from well -established membraneless compartments. mass spectrometry and bimolecular fluorescence complemen-tation assays revealed that casc3 sequesters heat shock protein 70 (hsp70-1) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), two host factors with roles in tombusvirus replication. overexpres-sion of hsp70-1 or gapdh reduced the antiviral activity of casc3 2.1-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively, and suggests that casc3 inhibits tcv by limiting host factor availability. unrelated tobacco mosaic virus (tmv) also depends on hsp70-1 and casc3 overexpression restricted tmv accumulation 4-fold and demonstrates that casc3 antiviral activity is not tcv-specific. like casc3, auxin response factor 19 (arf19) forms poorly dynamic condensates but arf19 overexpression failed to inhibit tcv accumulation and suggests that casc3 has antiviral activities that are not ubiquitous among cytoplasmic condensates.(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://crea-tivecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0605
"motivation: in time-critical clinical settings, such as precision medicine, genomic data needs to be processed as fast as possible to arrive at data-informed treatment decisions in a timely fashion. while sequencing throughput has dramatically increased over the past decade, bioinformatics analysis throughput has not been able to keep up with the pace of computer hardware improvement, and consequently has now turned into the primary bottleneck. modern computer hardware today is capable of much higher performance than current genomic informatics algorithms can typically utilize, therefore presenting opportunities for significant improvement of performance. accessing the raw sequencing data from bam files, e.g. is a necessary and time-consuming step in nearly all sequence analysis tools, however existing programming libraries for bam access do not take full advantage of the parallel input/output capabilities of storage devices. results: in an effort to stimulate the development of a new generation of faster sequence analysis tools, we developed quickbam, a software library to accelerate sequencing data access by exploiting the parallelism in commodity storage hardware currently widely available. we demonstrate that analysis software ported to quickbam consistently outperforms their current versions, in some cases finishing an analysis in under 3 min while the original version took 1.5 h, using the same storage solution. availability and implementation: open source and freely available at https://gitlab.com/yiq/quickbam/, we envision that quickbam will enable a new generation of high-performance informatics tools, either directly boosting their performance if they are currently data-access bottlenecked, or allow data-access to keep up with further optimizations in algorithms and compute techniques.",AB_0605

"background physicians have increasingly adopted twitter as a discussion and distribution platform for oncology research. while the influence of financial conflicts of interests (fcoi) on medical research is well documented, their role in the dissemination of research on social media platforms is not well known. in this study, we sought to evaluate the fcois of physicians followed by the top three oncology journals on twitter.materials and methods we used the open payments search tool (https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov) to assess fcois between 2016 and 2021 of united states (us) physicians followed by three oncology journals (journal of clinical oncology, the lancet oncology, and annals of oncology) on twitter.results of 1914 twitter accounts followed by the top three oncology journals on twitter, 547 (28.6%) belonged to us physicians. of these, 463 (84.6%) received general payments between 2016 and 2021. after excluding 30 us physicians currently in residency or fellowship, this percentage increased to 88.2% (n = 456/517). combined, the median (interquartile range) general payment amount was $8100 ($200-90,000). additionally, over $42 million in general payments were made between 2016 and 2021.conclusion our findings offer insight on fcois between oncology journals and us physicians on twitter. these findings may serve as the foundation for future research regarding optimal medical journal conduct on social media platforms.",AB_0605
"single-cell datasets are routinely collected to investigate changes in cellular state between control cells and the corresponding cells in a treatment condition, such as exposure to a drug or infection by a pathogen. to better understand heterogeneity in treatment response, it is desirable to deconvolve variations enriched in treated cells from those shared with controls. however, standard computational models of single-cell data are not designed to explicitly separate these variations. here, we introduce contrastive variational inference (contrastivevi; https://github.com/suinleelab/contrastivevi), a framework for deconvolving variations in treatment-control single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) datasets into shared and treatment-specific latent variables. using three treatment-control scrna-seq datasets, we apply contrastivevi to perform a variety of analysis tasks, including visualization, clustering and differential expression testing. we find that contrastivevi consistently achieves results that agree with known ground truths and often highlights subtle phenomena that may be difficult to ascertain with standard workflows. we conclude by generalizing contrastivevi to accommodate joint transcriptome and surface protein measurements.",AB_0605
"motivation: the spatial genome organization of a eukaryotic cell is important for its function. the development of single-cell technologies for probing the 3d genome conformation, especially single-cell chromosome conformation capture techniques, has enabled us to understand genome function better than before. however, due to extreme sparsity and high noise associated with single-cell hi-c data, it is still difficult to study genome structure and function using the hic-data of one single cell. results: in this work, we developed a deep learning method schicedrn based on deep residual networks and generative adversarial networks for the imputation and enhancement of hi-c data of a single cell. in terms of both image evaluation and hi-c reproducibility metrics, schicedrn outperforms the four deep learning methods (deephic, hicplus, hicsr, and loopenhance) on enhancing the raw single-cell hi-c data of human and drosophila. the experiments also show that it can generate single-cell hi-c data more suitable for identifying topologically associating domain boundaries and reconstructing 3d chromosome structures than the existing methods. moreover, schicedrn's performance generalizes well across different single cells and cell types, and it can be applied to improving population hi-c data. availability and implementation: the source code of schicedrn is available at the github repository: https://github.com/bioinfomachine learning/schicedrn.",AB_0605
"a wheeler graph represents a collection of strings in a way that is particularly easy to index and query. such a graph is a practical choice for representing a graph-shaped pangenome, and it is the foundation for current graph-based pangenome indexes. however, there are no practical tools to visualize or to check graphs that may have the wheeler properties. here, we present wheelie, an algorithm that combines a renaming heuristic with a permutation solver (wheelie-pr) or a satisfiability modulo theory (smt) solver (wheelie-smt) to check whether a given graph has the wheeler properties, a problem that is np-complete in general. wheelie can check a variety of random and real-world graphs in far less time than any algorithm proposed to date. it can check a graph with 1,000s of nodes in seconds. we implement these algorithms together with complementary visualization tools in the wgt toolkit, available as open source software at https://github.com/kuanhao-chao/wheeler_graph_toolkit.",AB_0605
"it remains to be ascertained whether sub-neptune exoplanets primarily possess hydrogen-rich atmospheres or whether a population of h2o-rich water worlds lurks in their midst. addressing this question requires improved modeling of water-rich exoplanetary atmospheres, both to predict and interpret spectroscopic observations and to serve as upper boundary conditions on interior structure calculations. here, we present new models of hydrogen-helium-water atmospheres with water abundances ranging from solar to 100% water vapor. we improve upon previous models of high-water-content atmospheres by incorporating updated prescriptions for water self-broadening and a nonideal gas equation of state. our model grid (https://umd.box.com/v/water-worlds) includes temperature-pressure profiles in radiative-convective equilibrium, along with their associated transmission and thermal emission spectra. we find that our model updates primarily act at high pressures, significantly impacting bottom-of-atmosphere temperatures, with implications for the accuracy of interior structure calculations. upper-atmosphere conditions and spectroscopic observables are less impacted by our model updates, and we find that, under most conditions, retrieval codes built for hot jupiters should also perform well on water-rich planets. we additionally quantify the observational degeneracies among both thermal emission and transmission spectra. we recover standard degeneracies with clouds and mean molecular weight for transmission spectra, and we find thermal emission spectra to be more readily distinguishable from one another in the water-poor (i.e., near-solar) regime.",AB_0605
