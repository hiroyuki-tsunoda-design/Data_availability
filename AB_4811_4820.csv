"introduction the berlin long-term observation of vascular events is a prospective cohort study that aims to improve prediction and disease-overarching mechanistic understanding of cardiovascular (cv) disease progression by comprehensively investigating a high-risk patient population with different organ manifestations. methods and analysis a total of 8000 adult patients will be recruited who have either suffered an acute cv event (cve) requiring hospitalisation or who have not experienced a recent acute cve but are at high cv risk. an initial study examination is performed during the acute treatment phase of the index cve or after inclusion into the chronic high risk arm. deep phenotyping is then performed after similar to 90 days and includes assessments of the patient's medical history, health status and behaviour, cardiovascular, nutritional, metabolic, and anthropometric parameters, and patient-related outcome measures. biospecimens are collected for analyses including 'omics' technologies (e.g., genomics, metabolomics, proteomics). subcohorts undergo mri of the brain, heart, lung and kidney, as well as more comprehensive metabolic, neurological and cv examinations. all participants are followed up for up to 10 years to assess clinical outcomes, primarily major adverse cves and patient-reported (value-based) outcomes. state-of-the-art clinical research methods, as well as emerging techniques from systems medicine and artificial intelligence, will be used to identify associations between patient characteristics, longitudinal changes and outcomes. ethics and dissemination the study was approved by the charite-universitatsmedizin berlin ethics committee (ea1/066/17). the results of the study will be disseminated through international peer-reviewed publications and congress presentations. clinical registry platform: http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/trial2.aspx? trialid=drks00016852. recruitment started on july 18, 2017. second study phase: approved who primary register: german clinical trials register drks00023323, date of registration: november 4, 2020, url: http://www.drks.de/drks00023323. recruitment started on january 1, 2021.",AB_0482
"introduction the objectives of the study are: to design and implement a pilot intervention to offer self-sampling kits to detect hiv, chlamydia trachomatis (ct), neisseria gonorrhoeae (ng) and treponema pallidum (tp) among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men and transgender women users of pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) as part of prep follow-up. to evaluate if the pilot intervention causes a reduction of the retention to prep follow-up among the target population. to analyse the capacity of the intervention to reduce the healthcare burden on the prep service. to evaluate the acceptability of the intervention among prep users and prep service healthcare workers and; to validate dried blood samples for treponemal and non-treponemal antibody detection using the dual path platform syphilis screening and confirmatory assay compared with blood drawn by venous puncture.methods and analysis we will perform a non-blinded randomised controlled non-inferiority trial among prep users on follow-up. participants on the control arm will follow the usual follow-up protocol with quarterly face-to-face visits where they will be tested for hiv and sexually transmitted infections (stis). participants in the experimental arm will alternate face-to-face meetings with online screening of hiv and stis. the website https://testate.org/ will include a module for online follow-up visits of participants. participants of the experimental arm will order self-sampling kits for hiv, ct, ng and tp through the website, will send the samples to the laboratory and check their results online. we will compare the retention to follow up and the healthcare burden in both arms. the acceptability of the intervention among participants and healthcare workers will be assessed.ethics and dissemination the project has been approved by the ceic-hugtip (reference: pi-22-051). subjects will be included after giving their informed consent. final conclusions and recommendations will be shared with stakeholders. two publications in peer-reviewed journals are expected.trial registration number nct05752643.",AB_0482
"multiplex immunofluorescence is a novel, high-content imaging technique that allows simultaneous in situ labeling of multiple tissue antigens. this technique is of growing relevance in the study of the tumor microenvironment, and the discovery of biomarkers of disease progression or response to immune-based therapies. given the number of markers and the potential complexity of the spatial interactions involved, the analysis of these images requires the use of machine learning tools that rely for their training on the availability of large image datasets, extremely laborious to annotate. we present synplex, a computer simulator of multiplexed immunofluorescence images from user-defined parameters: i. cell phenotypes, defined by the level of expression of markers and morphological parameters; ii. cellular neighborhoods based on the spatial association of cell phenotypes; and iii. interactions between cellular neighborhoods. we validate synplex by generating synthetic tissues that accurately simulate real cancer cohorts with underlying differences in the composition of their tumor microenvironment and show proof-of-principle examples of how synplex could be used for data augmentation when training machine learning models, and for the in silico selection of clinically relevant biomarkers. synplex is publicly available at https://github.com/djimenezsanchez/synplex.",AB_0482
"pursuing new sources for food production in a context of demographic growth requires achieving a sustainable production model to face the current climate crisis. the biorefinery concept emerges as a technological scheme for the integral processing of renew-able resources such as food waste obtained from the processing industry. this research aims to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the valorisation route of chickpea peel to produce dietary fibre. coupling process modelling with life cycle assessment ap-proaches allows designing the potential biorefinery platform and identifying factors that may restrict its application in large-scale production. global warming, particulate matter, eutrophication and ecotoxicity-related, fossil scarcity, among others, were the impact categories analysed with a cradle-to-gate approach. results showed, for instance, that one kilogram of dietary fibre product emits 7.62 kg co2 eq, 14.08 g pm2.5 and 4.37 g of p eq. furthermore, alkaline digestion and bleaching were the most impactful stages in the categories analysed, due to the use of potassium hydroxide and sodium chlorite, respectively. this research contributes to rethink chickpea hulls from the food industry as a byproduct towards high value-added products with applicability in the same industry.(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd on behalf of institution of chemical engineers. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://creati-vecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0482
"motivation including ion mobility separation (ims) into mass spectrometry proteomics experiments is useful to improve coverage and throughput. many ims devices enable linking experimentally derived mobility of an ion to its collisional cross-section (ccs), a highly reproducible physicochemical property dependent on the ion's mass, charge and conformation in the gas phase. thus, known peptide ion mobilities can be used to tailor acquisition methods or to refine database search results. the large space of potential peptide sequences, driven also by posttranslational modifications of amino acids, motivates an in silico predictor for peptide ccs. recent studies explored the general performance of varying machine-learning techniques, however, the workflow engineering part was of secondary importance. for the sake of applicability, such a tool should be generic, data driven, and offer the possibility to be easily adapted to individual workflows for experimental design and data processing.results we created ionmob, a python-based framework for data preparation, training, and prediction of collisional cross-section values of peptides. it is easily customizable and includes a set of pretrained, ready-to-use models and preprocessing routines for training and inference. using a set of & ap;21 000 unique phosphorylated peptides and & ap;17 000 mhc ligand sequences and charge state pairs, we expand upon the space of peptides that can be integrated into ccs prediction. lastly, we investigate the applicability of in silico predicted ccs to increase confidence in identified peptides by applying methods of re-scoring and demonstrate that predicted ccs values complement existing predictors for that task.availability and implementation the python package is available at github: https://github.com/thegreatherrlebert/ionmob.",AB_0482
"gene regulatory networks (grns) and gene co-expression networks (gcns) allow genome-wide exploration of molecular regulation patterns in health and disease. the standard approach for obtaining grns and gcns is to infer them from gene expression data, using computational network inference methods. however, since network inference methods are usually applied on aggregate data, distortion of the networks by demographic confounders might remain undetected, especially because gene expression patterns are known to vary between different demographic groups. in this paper, we present a computational framework to systematically evaluate the influence of demographic confounders on network inference from gene expression data. our framework compares similarities between networks inferred for different demographic groups with similarity distributions obtained for random splits of the expression data. moreover, it allows to quantify to which extent demographic groups are represented by networks inferred from the aggregate data in a confounder-agnostic way. we apply our framework to test four widely used grn and gcn inference methods as to their robustness w. r. t. confounding by age, ethnicity and sex in cancer. our findings based on more than inferred networks indicate that age and sex confounders play an important role in network inference for certain cancer types, emphasizing the importance of incorporating an assessment of the effect of demographic confounders into network inference workflows. our framework is available as a python package on github: https://github.com/bionetslab/grn-confounders.",AB_0482
"the available protein structure data are rapidly increasing. within these structures, numerous local structural sites depict the details characterizing structure and function. however, searching and analyzing these sites extensively and at scale poses a challenge. we present a new method to search local sites in protein structure databases using residue-defined local 3d micro-environments. we implemented the method in a new tool called microminer and demonstrate the capabilities of residue micro-environment search on the example of structural mutation analysis. usually, experimental structures for both the wild-type and the mutant are unavailable for comparison. with microminer, we extracted amino acid pairs in protein structures from the pdb, exemplifying single mutations' local structural changes for single chains and pairs for protein-protein interfaces. we further annotate existing data sets of experimentally measured mutation effects, like measurements, with the extracted structure pairs to combine the mutation effect measurement with the structural change upon mutation. in addition, we show how microminer can bridge the gap between mutation analysis and structure-based drug design tools. microminer is available as a command line tool and interactively on the https://proteins.plus/ webserver.",AB_0482
"backgrounddue to the growing gap between the demand and supply of therapeutic services for people suffering from depression, with this study, we are investigating the effectiveness and factors of influence of new approaches in group treatments for depression. two previous studies have already identified bouldering psychotherapy (bpt) as an effective option. it combines psychotherapeutic interventions with action- and body-oriented bouldering exercises. mental model therapy (mmt) is a new cognitive-behavioral approach for treating depression. it focuses on identifying cognitive distortions, biases in decision making, and false assumptions and aims to correct and replace them with useful mental models. we aim to investigate the effectiveness of the interventions compared with a control group (cg) and to assess the factors of influence in a mixed methods approach.methodsthe study is being conducted as a randomized controlled intervention trial. adult participants with unipolar depression are being randomized into three groups (bpt, mmt, or cg), and the first two groups are undergoing a 10-week treatment phase. cg follows their individual standard treatment as usual. a priori power analysis revealed that about 120 people should be included to capture a moderate effect. the primary outcome of the study is depression rated with the montgomery and asberg depression rating scale (madrs) before (t0), directly after (t1), and 12 months after the intervention phase (t2). data are being collected via questionnaires, computer-assisted video interviews, and physical examinations. the primary hypotheses will be statistically analyzed by mixed model anovas to compare the three groups over time. for secondary outcomes, further multivariate methods (e.g., mixed model anovas and regression analyses) will be conducted. qualitative data will be evaluated on the basis of the qualitative thematic analysis.discussionthis study is investigating psychological and physical effects of bpt and mmt and its factors of influence on outpatients suffering from depression compared with a cg in a highly naturalistic design. the study could therefore provide insight into the modes of action of group therapy for depression and help to establish new short-term group treatments. methodological limitations of the study might be the clinical heterogeneity of the sample and confounding effects due to simultaneous individual psychotherapy.trial registrationisrctn, isrctn12347878. registered 28 march 2022, https://www.isrctn.com/isrctn12347878.",AB_0482

"spatially and timely accurate information about tropical forest disturbances is crucial for tracking critical forest changes, supporting forest management, and enabling law enforcement activities. in recent years, forest disturbance monitoring and alerting using cloud-penetrating synthetic aperture radar (sar) imagery has proven effective at national and pan-tropical scales. related detection approaches mostly rely on detecting postdisturbance altered backscatter values in c or l-band sar backscatter time series. some disturbances are characterized by post-disturbance tree remnants or debris. for the time periods where these kinds of remnants remain present at the surface, the sar backscatter values can be similar to those of stable forest. this can cause omission errors and delayed detection and it is considered a key shortcoming of current backscatter-based approaches. we hypothesized that despite fairly stable backscatter values, different orientation and arrangement of tree remnants leads to an altered heterogeneity of neighboring pixel values and that this can be quantified by textural features. we assessed six uncorrelated gray-level co-occurrence matrix (glcm) textural features using dense sentinel-1c-band sar time series. forest disturbances, based on each glcm feature using a pixel-based probabilistic change detection algorithm, were compared against results from forest disturbances mapped based only on backscatter data. we studied the impact of speckle-filtering on glcm features and glcm kernel sizes. we developed a method to combine backscatter and glcm features, and we evaluated its robustness for a variety of natural and human-induced forest disturbance types across the amazon biome. out of the six tested glcm features glcm sum average (savg) performed best. glcm features derived from non-speckle filtered and speckle-filtered backscatter data did not show a noticeable impact on accuracy. a combination of backscatter and glcm savg resulted in a reduced omission error of up to 36% and an improved timeliness of detections by average of to 30 days, with individual detection showing even higher improvements on a pixel level. the method was found to be robust across a variety of forest disturbance types. the largest reduction of omission errors and greatest improvement of timeliness was evident for sites with large unfragmented disturbance patches (e.g., large-scale clearings, fires and mining). for increasing glcm kernel sizes, we observed a trade-off between reduced omission errors combined with improved timeliness and increasing commission errors. a kernel size of 5 was found to provide the best trade-off for reducing omission errors and improving timeliness while not introducing commission errors. the results emphasize that combining sar-based textural features and backscatter can overcome omission errors caused by post-disturbance tree remnants or debris. this can help to improve the consistency and timelines of short (c-band) and long wavelength (l-band) based operational sar disturbance monitoring and alerting. result maps can be visualized via: https://johannesballing.users.earthengine.app/view/ forest-disturbance-texture.",AB_0482
