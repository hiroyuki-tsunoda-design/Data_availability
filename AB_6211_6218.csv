"a fundamental principle of biology is that proteins tend to form complexes to play important roles in the core functions of cells. for a complete understanding of human cellular functions, it is crucial to have a comprehensive atlas of human protein complexes. unfortunately, we still lack such a comprehensive atlas of experimentally validated protein complexes, which prevents us from gaining a complete understanding of the compositions and functions of human protein complexes, as well as the underlying biological mechanisms. to fill this gap, we built human protein complexes atlas (hpc-atlas), as far as we know, the most accurate and comprehensive atlas of human protein complexes available to date. we integrated two latest protein interaction networks, and developed a novel computational method to identify nearly 9000 protein complexes, including many previously uncharacterized complexes. compared with the existing methods, our method achieved outstanding performance on both testing and independent datasets. furthermore, with hpc-atlas we identified 751 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)affected human protein complexes, and 456 multifunctional proteins that contain many potential moonlighting proteins. these results suggest that hpc-atlas can serve as not only a computing framework to effectively identify biologically meaningful protein complexes by integrating multiple protein data sources, but also a valuable resource for exploring new biological findings. the hpc- atlas webserver is freely available at http://www.yulpan.top/hpc-atlas.",AB_0622
"the resource for coronavirus 2019 (rcov19) is an open -access information resource dedicated to providing valuable data on the genomes, mutations, and variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). in this updated implementation of rcov19, we have made significant improvements and advancements over the previous version. firstly, we have implemented a highly refined genome data curation model. this model now features an automated integration pipeline and optimized curation rules, enabling efficient daily updates of data in rcov19. secondly, we have developed a global and regional lineage evolution monitoring platform, alongside an outbreak risk pre -warning system. these additions provide a comprehensive understanding of sars-cov-2 evolution and transmission patterns, enabling better preparedness and response strategies. thirdly, we have developed a powerful interactive mutation spectrum comparison module. this module allows users to compare and analyze mutation patterns, assisting in the detection of potential new lineages. furthermore, we have incorporated a comprehensive knowledgebase on mutation effects. this knowledgebase serves as a valuable resource for retrieving information on the functional implications of specific mutations. in summary, rcov19 serves as a vital scientific resource, providing access to valuable data, relevant information, and technical support in the global fight against covid-19. the complete contents of rcov19 are available to the public at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ncov/.",AB_0622
"biological databases serve as a global fundamental infrastructure for the worldwide scientific community, which dramatically aid the transformation of big data into knowledge discovery and drive significant innovations in a wide range of research fields. given the rapid data production, biological databases continue to increase in size and importance. to build a catalog of worldwide biological databases, we curate a total of 5825 biological databases from 8931 publications, which are geographically distributed in 72 countries/regions and developed by 1975 institutions (as of september 20, 2022). we further devise a z -index, a novel index to characterize the scientific impact of a database, and rank all these biological databases as well as their hosting institutions and countries in terms of citation and z -index. consequently, we present a series of statistics and trends of worldwide biological databases, yielding a global perspective to better understand their status and impact for life and health sciences. an up -to -date catalog of worldwide biological databases, as well as their curated meta-information and derived statistics, is publicly available at database commons (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/databasecommons/).",AB_0622
"leishmaniasis is a detrimental disease causing serious changes in quality of life and some forms can lead to death. the disease is spread by the parasite leishmania transmitted by sandfly vectors and their primary hosts are vertebrates including humans. the pathogen penetrates host cells and secretes proteins (the secretome) to repurpose cells for pathogen growth and to alter cell signaling via host-pathogen protein-protein interactions). here, we present leishmaniadb, a database specifically designed to investigate how leishmania virulence factors may interfere with host proteins. since the secretomes of different leishmania species are only partially characterized, we collated various experimental evidence and used computational predictions to identify leishmania secreted proteins to generate a user-friendly unified web resource allowing users to access all information available on experimental and predicted secretomes. in addition, we manually annotated host-pathogen interactions of 211 proteins and the localization/function of 3764 transmembrane (tm) proteins of different leishmania species. we also enriched all proteins with automatic structural and functional predictions that can provide new insights in the molecular mechanisms of infection. our database may provide novel insights into leishmania host-pathogen interactions and help to identify new therapeutic targets for this neglected disease.database url https://leishmaniadb.ttk.hu/",AB_0622
"a new gyracanthid, gyracanthus? jasperi, is described based on partially articulated and isolated elements from the lower carboniferous (mississippian) lower waugh member of the ste genevieve formation, at the early tetrapod site near delta, iowa, u.s.a. pectoral fin spines of the new gyracanthid are characterized by the insertion on the fin spine being a half to one-third the length of the spine and maximum length:depth ratio 10:1. ornament ridges on the pectoral fin spine converge at >= 90 degrees along a low leading edge ridge, and ridge tubercles are oriented oblique to the ridge; the distal end of one pectoral is described using micro-computed tomography. the scapulocoracoids have an anteriorly curving bulbous apex, and a base length that is 35-40% of pectoral spine length. the procoracoid is associated with an unornamented ventral plate. a possible isolated dorsal fin spine is more symmetrical and less worn than the pectoral fin spines. pelvic spines are dorsoventrally flattened, with oblique ridges meeting at approximately 100 degrees proximally and 80 degrees distally, along a smooth leading edge ridge. scales, found on the partial articulated specimen and as isolated remains, are polyodontode with a flat base. adults of the new taxon are estimated to have been about one meter long. deposition was in debris flows, within a sinkhole lake most likely removed from the edge of the ocean. other carboniferous gyracanthids from north america are reviewed.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:5c26f98a-e630-4fd6-99a5-f08b5cbb1549",AB_0622
"a new gyracanthid gyracanthides riniensis is described from the famennian (latest devonian) waterloo farm lagerstatte in the witpoort formation, near makhanda/grahamstown, south africa. the new species is based on disarticulated remains including pectoral, pelvic, and median fin spines, endoskeletal shoulder girdle elements, and squamation patches preserved on or close to the same bedding plane. the new taxon is distinguished by having a relatively large, ornate median spine, and arrowhead-shaped tubercular ornament on the spine ridges. the species shows closest resemblance in pectoral spine proportions to gyracanthides murrayi from the earliest carboniferous of australia, and in spine tubercular ornament to its laurussian contemporary gyracanthus sherwoodi. it differs in spine proportions and ornament from the older (givetian) and younger (early carboniferous) gyracanthids found in nearby localities.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:adf4869c-45dc-4854-9f27-37d490f6d388",AB_0622

"over the last couple of decades, there has been a rapid growth in the number and scope of agricultural genetics, genomics and breeding databases and resources. the agbiodata consortium (https://www.agbiodata.org/) currently represents 44 databases and resources (https://www.agbiodata.org/databases) covering model or crop plant and animal ggb data, ontologies, pathways, genetic variation and breeding platforms (referred to as 'databases' throughout). one of the goals of the consortium is to facilitate fair (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data management and the integration of datasets which requires data sharing, along with structured vocabularies and/or ontologies. two agbiodata working groups, focused on data sharing and ontologies, respectively, conducted a consortium-wide survey to assess the current status and future needs of the members in those areas. a total of 33 researchers responded to the survey, representing 37 databases. results suggest that data-sharing practices by agbiodata databases are in a fairly healthy state, but it is not clear whether this is true for all metadata and data types across all databases; and that, ontology use has not substantially changed since a similar survey was conducted in 2017. based on our evaluation of the survey results, we recommend (i) providing training for database personnel in a specific data-sharing techniques, as well as in ontology use; (ii) further study on what metadata is shared, and how well it is shared among databases; (iii) promoting an understanding of data sharing and ontologies in the stakeholder community; (iv) improving data sharing and ontologies for specific phenotypic data types and formats; and (v) lowering specific barriers to data sharing and ontology use, by identifying sustainability solutions, and the identification, promotion, or development of data standards. combined, these improvements are likely to help agbiodata databases increase development efforts towards improved ontology use, and data sharing via programmatic means.database url https://www.agbiodata.org/databases",AB_0622
