"few studies have been designed to investigate the effect of serum choline on the risk of incident cancer. this study aims to explore the association between serum choline and the risk of new-onset cancer. we conducted a case-control study, including 199 patients with incident cancer and 199 matched controls during a median of 3.9 years of follow-up, nested within the china stroke primary prevention trial. cubic spline regression (rcs) and conditional logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of serum choline and incident cancer risk. we observed a positive dose-response association between serum choline levels and the risk of overall (p for overall = 0.046) and digestive system cancer (p for overall = 0.039). compared with patients with the lowest choline levels (q1 group), patients in the highest levels of choline (q4) had a 3.69-fold and 6.01-fold increased risk of overall (or = 3.69, 95% ci 1.17-11.63) and digestive system cancer (or = 6.01, 95% ci 1.14-31.67). elevated choline levels (per sd, 11.49 mu g/ml) were associated with a higher risk of overall cancer among participants who were older, male, and smokers in the subgroup analyses. we found a positive association between elevated levels of serum choline with increased risk of incident cancer. our findings have critical clinical implications for cancer prevention and diagnosis.trial registration csppt, nct00794885. registered: november 20, 2008. https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/nct00794885https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/nct00794885.",AB_0211
"image composition is a challenging image editing operation that targets the compositing of a new image by combining cropped regions from different images. a common application is background replacement of portrait images. existing composition methods usually result in undesirable artifacts along the boundaries of pasted regions due to imprecise extraction. to address this problem, we propose a refined-mask guided multi-stream blending network (mgmb-net), which consists of a multi-stream block (msb), reconstructing the foreground boundary of composited image, mask-refine blocks (mrbs), providing better location information and refined-mask guided blocks (mgbs), guiding the reconstruction of composited image to eliminate boundary artifacts. mgmb-net can generate more harmonious and realistic images by fusing multi-stream features and refining input coarse masks. we propose two data-generation methods to construct new datasets on image blending, and two evaluation metrics, psnr (peak signal-to-noise ratio)-sobel and psnr-boundary, to decouple the performance of blending and harmonization. compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves the best performance on portrait images without additional refinements or prior information. our code and model are available at https://github.com/wekect/mgmb-net.",AB_0211
"semantic segmentation has wide applications in computer vision tasks. due to the high labor cost of pixel-level annotation, weakly supervised semantic segmentation(wsss) methods based on image-level labels have become an important research topic. however, existing wsss based on image-level labels has problems such as sparse segmentation results and inaccurate object boundaries. to overcome these problems, we propose a novel locate-then-segment framework that separates the localization process and segmentation process of wsss. during the localization process we use class activation map(cam) to locate the rough position of the object as most wsss methods do. during the segmentation process, we focused on designing the object segmenter to refine the cam to obtain the pseudo mask. the object segmenter consists of a dual localization feature fusion module and a boundary enhancement decoder. the former effectively extracts the semantic features of the object and finds the whole object; the latter judges long-range pixels to search for the exact object boundary. additionally, we utilize extra pixel-level labels to train our object segmenter and add some constraints to optimize its training process. finally, we apply the trained object segmenter to weakly supervised segmented data to improve the prediction results of cam. experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves the quality of pseudo masks and obtains competitive segmentation results. compared to existing methods, our method has the best result on the pascal voc 2012 validation set with 68.8% miou and the competitive result on the test set with 67.9% miou. our method outperforms all cnn-based methods on the ms coco 2014 validation set, second only to transformer-based methods, achieving 36.5% miou. code is available at https://github.com/wjlbnw/segmentationfromlocalization.",AB_0211
"background: a critical aspect of in silico drug discovery involves the prediction of drug-target affinity (dta). conducting wet lab experiments to determine affinity is both expensive and time-consuming, making it necessary to find alternative approaches. in recent years, deep learning has emerged as a promising technique for dta prediction, leveraging the substantial computational power of modern computers. methods: we proposed a novel sequence-based approach, named kc-dta, for predicting drug-target affinity (dta). in this approach, we converted the target sequence into two distinct matrices, while representing the molecule compound as a graph. the proposed method utilized k-mers analysis and cartesian product calculation to capture the interactions and evolutionary information among various residues, enabling the creation of the two matrices for target sequence. for molecule, it was represented by constructing a molecular graph where atoms serve as nodes and chemical bonds serve as edges. subsequently, the obtained target matrices and molecule graph were utilized as inputs for convolutional neural networks (cnns) and graph neural networks (gnns) to extract hidden features, which were further used for the prediction of binding affinity. results: in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted several experiments and made a comprehensive comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches using multiple evaluation metrics. the results of our experiments demonstrated that the kc-dta method achieves high performance in predicting drug-target affinity (dta). the findings of this research underscore the significance of the kc-dta method as a valuable tool in the field of in silico drug discovery, offering promising opportunities for accelerating the drug development process. all the data and code are available for access on https://github.com/syc2017/kcdta.",AB_0211
"despite the remarkable progress of general object detection, the lack of labeled aerial images limits the robustness and generalization of the detector. teacher-student learning is a feasible solution on natural image domain, but few works focus on unlabeled aerial images. inspired by foundation models with the powerful generalization in computer vision field, we propose an expert teacher framework based on foundation image segmentation model called et-fsm. our approach provides the performance gains for the student detector by generating high-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled aerial images. in the et-fsm, we design the binary detector with expert guidance mechanism to sufficiently leverage the extra knowledge obtained from the foundation image segmentation model, which accurately detects object positions in the complex backgrounds. also, we present the momentum contrast classification module to distinguish confused object categories in aerial images. to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we construct an unlabeled aerial image dataset covering various scenes. the experiments are conducted on diverse types of student detectors. the results show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, and allows the student detector to achieve fully supervised performance with much less labeled aerial images. our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/cq100/et-fsm.",AB_0211
"large datasets with noisy labels and high dimensions have become increasingly prevalent in industry. these datasets often contain errors or inconsistencies in the assigned labels and introduce a vast number of predictive variables. such issues frequently arise in real-world scenarios due to uncertainties or human errors during data collection and annotation processes. the presence of noisy labels and high dimensions can significantly impair the generalization ability and accuracy of trained models. to address the above issues, we introduce a simple-structured penalized gamma-divergence model and a novel meta-gradient correction algorithm and establish the foundations of these two modules based on rigorous theoretical proofs. finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate their effectiveness in detecting noisy labels and mitigating the curse of dimensionality and suggest that our proposed model and algorithm can achieve promising outcomes. moreover, we open-source our codes and distinctive datasets on github (refer to https://github.com/debtvc2022/robust_learning_with_mgc).",AB_0211
"sepsis and sepsis-related diseases cause a high rate of mortality worldwide. the molecular and cellular mechanisms of sepsis are still unclear. we aim to identify key genes in sepsis and reveal potential disease mechanisms. six sepsis-related blood transcriptome datasets were collected and analyzed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (wgcna). functional annotation was performed in the gprofiler tool. dsigdb was used for drug signature enrichment analysis. the proportion of immune cells was estimated by the cibersort tool. the relationships between modules, immune cells, and survival were identified by correlation analysis and survival analysis. a total of 37 stable co-expressed gene modules were identified. these modules were associated with the critical biology process in sepsis. four modules can independently separate patients with long and short survival. three modules can recurrently separate sepsis and normal patients with high accuracy. some modules can separate bacterial pneumonia, influenza pneumonia, mixed bacterial and influenza a pneumonia, and non-infective systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs). drug signature analysis identified drugs associated with sepsis, such as testosterone, phytoestrogens, ibuprofen, urea, dichlorvos, potassium persulfate, and vitamin b12. finally, a gene co-expression network database was constructed (https://liqs.shinyapps.io/sepsis/). the recurrent modules in sepsis may facilitate disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.",AB_0211
"backgroundallele-specific binding (asb) events occur when transcription factors (tfs) bind more favorably to one of the two parental alleles at heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps). evidence suggests that asb events could reveal the impact of sequence variations on tf binding and may have implications for the risk of diseases.resultshere we present asb-analyzer, a software platform that enables the users to quickly and efficiently input raw sequencing data to generate individual reports containing the cytogenetic map of asb snps and their associated phenotypes. this interactive tool thereby combines asb snp identification, biological annotation, motif analysis, phenotype associations and report summary in one pipeline. with this pipeline, we identified 3772 asb snps from thirty gm12878 chip-seq datasets and demonstrated that the asb snps were more likely to be enriched at important sites in tf-binding domains.conclusionsasb-analyzer is a user-friendly tool that enables the detection, characterization and visualization of asb snps. it is implemented in python, r and bash shell and packaged in the conda environment. it is available as an open-source tool on github at https://github.com/liying1996/asbanalyzer.",AB_0211
"dna 5-methylcytosine (5mc) is widely present in multicellular eukaryotes, which plays important roles in various developmental and physiological processes and a wide range of human diseases. thus, it is essential to accurately detect the 5mc sites. although current sequencing technologies can map genome-wide 5mc sites, these experimental methods are both costly and time-consuming. to achieve a fast and accurate prediction of 5mc sites, we propose a new computational approach, bert5mc. first, we pre-trained a domain-specific bert (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) model by using human promoter sequences as language corpus. bert is a deep two-way language representation model based on transformer. second, we fine-tuned the domain-specific bert model based on the 5mc training dataset to build the model. the cross-validation results show that our model achieves an auroc of 0.966 which is higher than other state-of-the-art methods such as ipromoter-5mc, 5mc_pred, and bilstm-5mc. furthermore, our model was evaluated on the independent test set, which shows that our model achieves an auroc of 0.966 that is also higher than other state-of-the-art methods. moreover, we analyzed the attention weights generated by bert to identify a number of nucleotide distributions that are closely associated with 5mc modifications. to facilitate the use of our model, we built a webserver which can be freely accessed at: http://5mc-pred.zhulab.org.cn.",AB_0211
"single-cell sequencing has shed light on previously inaccessible biological questions from different fields of research, including organism development, immune function, and disease progression. the number of single-cell-based studies increased dramatically over the past decade. several new methods and tools have been continuously developed, making it extremely tricky to navigate this research landscape and develop an up-to-date workflow to analyze single-cell sequencing data, particularly for researchers seeking to enter this field without computational experience. moreover, choosing appropriate tools and optimal parameters to meet the demands of researchers represents a major challenge in processing single-cell sequencing data. however, a specific resource for easy access to detailed information on single-cell sequencing methods and data processing pipelines is still lacking. in the present study, an online resource called singlescan was developed to curate all up-to-date single-cell transcriptome/genome analyzing tools and pipelines. all the available tools were categorized according to their main tasks, and several typical workflows for single-cell data analysis were summarized. in addition, spatial transcriptomics, which is a breakthrough molecular analysis method that enables researchers to measure all gene activity in tissue samples and map the site of activity, was included along with a portion of single-cell and spatial analysis solutions. for each processing step, the available tools and specific parameters used in published articles are provided and how these parameters affect the results is shown in the resource. all information used in the resource was manually extracted from related literature. an interactive website was designed for data retrieval, visualization, and download. by analyzing the included tools and literature, users can gain insights into the trends of single-cell studies and easily grasp the specific usage of a specific tool. singlescan will facilitate the analysis of single-cell sequencing data and promote the development of new tools to meet the growing and diverse needs of the research community. the singlescan database is publicly accessible via the website at http://cailab.labshare.cn/singlescan.",AB_0211
