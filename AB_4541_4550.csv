"background: the european crohn's and colitis organization guidelines have highlighted the importance of the preoperative evaluation of the affected segment length in patients with ileocolic crohn's disease to determine the best surgical approach. objective: this study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of preoperative magnetic resonance enterography in assessing the length of the affected segment in patients with ileocolic crohn's disease. design: this observational study was conducted with a prospectively maintained database and retrospective analysis. settings: this study was conducted in a tertiary center. patients: this study included consecutive patients undergoing ileocolic resection for crohn's disease between august 2014 and june 2020. all patients underwent a preoperative magnetic resonance enterography. main outcome measures: the correlation between the length measured on magnetic resonance enterography and pathological examination was evaluated. results: a total of 96 patients were included. the median time between magnetic resonance enterography and surgery was 65.5 (3-331) days. the length of the affected segment on magnetic resonance enterography was correlated with the length assessed on pathological evaluation (r = 0.48, p < 0.001). no correlation was found between the 2 measurements when imaging was performed >6 months before surgery (r = 0.14, p = 0.62). the presence of an abscess underestimated the length affected by crohn's disease on imaging compared to pathology, whereas the presence of a fistula was associated with magnetic resonance enterography overestimation of the length of the affected segment. limitations: limitations included single-center study and retrospective analysis. conclusion: in crohn's disease, preoperative magnetic resonance enterography is a highly reliable tool for predicting the length of the affected segment compared to pathology examination in the absence of an abscess or fistula. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c26.",AB_0455
"contrastive representation learning has proven to be an effective self-supervised learning method for images and videos. most successful approaches are based on noise contrastive estimation (nce) and use different views of an instance as positives that should be contrasted with other instances, called negatives, that are considered as noise. however, several instances in a dataset are drawn from the same distribution and share underlying semantic information. a good data representation should contain relations between the instances, or semantic similarity and dissimilarity, that contrastive learning harms by considering all negatives as noise. to circumvent this issue, we propose a novel formulation of contrastive learning using semantic similarity between instances called similarity contrastive estimation (sce). our training objective is a soft contrastive one that brings the positives closer and estimates a continuous distribution to push or pull negative instances based on their learned similarities. we validate empirically our approach on both image and video representation learning. we show that sce performs competitively with the state of the art on the imagenet linear evaluation protocol for fewer pretraining epochs and that it generalizes to several downstream image tasks. we also show that sce reaches state-of-the-art results for pretraining video representation and that the learned representation can generalize to video downstream tasks. source code is available here: https://github.com/juliendenize/eztorch.",AB_0455
"training state-of-the-art models for human pose estimation in videos requires datasets with annotations that are really hard and expensive to obtain. although transformers have been recently utilized for body pose sequence modeling, related methods rely on pseudo-ground truth to augment the currently limited training data available for learning such models. in this paper, we introduce posebert, a transformer module that is fully trained on 3d motion capture (mocap) data via masked modeling. it is simple, generic and versatile, as it can be plugged on top of any image-based model to transform it in a video-based model leveraging temporal information. we showcase variants of posebert with different inputs varying from 3d skeleton keypoints to rotations of a 3d parametric model for either the full body (smpl) or just the hands (mano). since posebert training is task agnostic, the model can be applied to several tasks such as pose refinement, future pose prediction or motion completion without finetuning. our experimental results validate that adding posebert on top of various state-of-the-art pose estimation methods consistently improves their performances, while its low computational cost allows us to use it in a real-time demo for smoothly animating a robotic hand via a webcam. test code and models are available at https://github.com/naver/posebert.",AB_0455
"endoscopic observation is performed during treatments by flexible ureteroscopy to differentiate in situ between renal papillary abnormalities and stones based on their concordance with daudon's morphological/composition descriptions adapted to endoscopy. these intraoperative visual analyses are now an integral part of the urinary stone disease diagnostic approach in addition to the morphological/structural and spectrophotometric analysis that remains the reference exam, but that loses information on the stone component representativeness due to the development of in situ laser lithotripsy. these are the first practical recommendations on the endoscopic description of renal papillae and stones. methodology. - these recommendations were developed using two methods: the clinical practice recommendations (cpr) and the adapte method, depending on whether the question was considered in the european association of urology (eau) recommendations (https://uroweb.org/guidelines/urolithiasis [eau guidelines on urolithiasis. 2022]) and their adaptability to the french context.

"the primary objective of the combined approach is to limit the number of percu-taneous access tracts for the treatment of staghorn, or complex kidney stones by simultaneous percutaneous antegrade and retrograde ureteroscopy. the other indication is the simultaneous presence of several kidney and ureteral stones or of an impacted pelvic stone. the combination of the two techniques may increase the stone-free rate and decrease the retreatment rate of complex stones compared with percutaneous nephrolithotomy alone. the patient is usually in the modified supine position.methodology. - these recommendations were developed using two methods: the clinical prac-tice recommendation (cpr) method and the adapte method, depending on whether the question was considered in the european association of urology (eau) recommendations (https://uroweb.org/guidelines/urolithiasis) [eau guidelines on urolithiasis.2022] and their adaptability to the french context.(c) 2023 elsevier masson sas. all rights reserved.",AB_0455
"only few hundred interventions are performed in france each year to remove upper urinary tract stones using a laparoscopic/robotic transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach. these interventions are proposed to patients with large (> 20 mm) and complex stones, sometimes after failure of endoscopic techniques or in the presence of malformations that can be treated at the same time. the major interest of these interventions is the possibility to remove the whole stone without prior fragmentation. some anatomical situations can increase the technical difficulty, particularly the presence of an intrarenal pelvis and the presence of pelvic and periureteral adhesions. the reported complications are essentially urinary fistula and ureteral stenosis, the risks of which are reduced by the use of double j stenting. as struvite stones are more friable, their whole removal is more difficult and may lead to dispersion of fragments, particularly during laparoscopy. conventional open surgery has a higher stone-free rate, but comes with a greater kidney function loss.methodology. - these recommendations were developed using two methods: the clinical practice recommendation (cpr) method and the adapte method, depending on whether the question was considered in the european association of urology (eau) recommendations (https://uroweb.org/guidelines/urolithiasis) (eau guidelines on urolithiasis. 2022) and their adaptability to the french context.(c) 2023 elsevier masson sas. all rights reserved.",AB_0455
"the incidence of urinary lithiasis is rising steadily in industrialized countries, and its prevalence in the general population of france is estimated at 10%. renal colic accounts for 1-2% of emergency department consultations. at a time when the new laser stone fragmen-tation techniques available to urologists will lead to ever finer in situ pulverization of stones, the exact identification of the compounds that form the stone is essential for etiological diag-nosis. constitutional analysis by infrared spectrophotometry or x-ray diffraction is therefore recommended, to be complemented by morphological typing of the calculi. methodology. - these recommendations have been drawn up using two methods: the recommendation for clinical practice (rpc) method and the adapte method, depend-ing on whether or not the issue was considered in the eau recommendations (https://uroweb.org/guidelines/urolithiasis) [eau 2022] and their adaptability to the french context.

"the choice of imaging modality is guided by the clinical presentation and the context (acute or not). although ultrasound is safe (no radiation) and easily available, non -contrast-enhanced ct has become the gold standard in the diagnostic strategy for patients with acute flank pain because of its sensitivity (93.1%) and specificity (96.6%). it also allows determining the stone size, volume and density, visualizing their internal structure, and assess-ing their distance from the skin and the adjacent anatomy. all these parameters can influence the stone management and the choice of intervention modality. methodology. - these recommendations were developed using two methods: the clinical prac-tice recommendations method (cpr) and the adapte method, depending on whether the issue was considered in the eau recommendations (https://uroweb.org/guidelines/urolithiasis [eau guidelines on urolithiasis. 2022]) and their adaptability to the french context.(c) 2023 elsevier masson sas. all rights reserved.",AB_0455
"the morphological-compositional analysis of urinary stones allows distinguishing schematically several situations: dietary, digestive, metabolic/hormonal, infectious and genetic problems. blood and urine testing are recommended in the first instance to identify risk factors of urinary stone disease in order to avoid recurrence or progression. the other objective is to detect a potential underlying pathology associated with high risk of urinary stone disease (e.g. primary hyperparathyroidism, primary or enteric hyperoxaluria, cystinuria, distal renal tubular acidosis) that may require specific management. lifestyle-diet measures are the basis of the management of all stone types, but pharmacological treatments may be required.methodology. - these recommendations were developed using two methods: the clinical prac-tice recommendation (cpr) method and the adapte method, depending on whether the question was considered in the european association of urology (eau) recommendations (https://uroweb.org/guidelines/urolithiasis) [eau 2022] and their adaptability to the french context.(c) 2023 elsevier masson sas. all rights reserved.",AB_0455
"the main objectives of interventional stone treatment are stone removal, symptom elimination, and kidney function preservation. after treatment of kidney stones (extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy [eswl], or endoscopy), fragments may remain in the kidney, either deliberately left in place or due to treatment failure (i.e. residual stone [rs], resistant to eswl, left or inaccessible by endoscopy), or due to failure to eliminate the obtained fragments (i.e. residual fragments [rf]). their management may differ. the most commonly used definition of rf in the literature is based on a size cut-off (<= 4 mm) and on three criteria: spontaneous clearance rate, secondary intervention rate, and disease progression rate. rf may be spontaneously eliminated (42%), persist and increase in size (32%), or become complicated and require a secondary urological procedure (36%). like for the initial treatment, it is important to consider the stone composition for the treatment decision-making concerning rs/rf. methodology. - these recommendations were developed using two methods: the clinical practice recommendation (cpr) method and the adapte method, depending on whether the question was considered in the european association of urology (eau) recommendations (https://uroweb.org/guidelines/urolithiasis) (eau, 2022) and their adaptability to the french context.(c) 2023 elsevier masson sas. all rights reserved.",AB_0455
