"purpose. lymphopenia is a common side effect in patients treated with radiotherapy, potentially caused by direct cell killing of circulating lymphocytes in the blood. to investigate this hypothesis, a method to assess dose to circulating lymphocytes is needed. methods. a stochastic model to simulate systemic blood flow in the human body was developed based on a previously designed compartment model. blood dose was obtained by superimposing the spatiotemporal distribution of blood particles with a time-varying dose rate field, and used as a surrogate for dose to circulating lymphocytes. we discuss relevant theory on compartmental modeling and how to combine it with models of explicit organ vasculature. results. a general workflow was established which can be used for any anatomical site. stochastic compartments can be replaced by explicit models of organ vasculatures for improved spatial resolution, and tumor compartments can be dynamically assigned. generating a patient-specific blood flow distribution takes about one minute, fast enough to investigate the effect of varying treatment parameters such as the dose rate. furthermore, the anatomical structures contributing most to the overall blood dose can be identified, which could potentially be used for lymphocyte-sparing treatment planning. conclusion. the ability to report the blood dose distribution during radiotherapy is imperative to test and act upon the current paradigm that radiation-induced lymphopenia is caused by direct cell killing of lymphocytes in the blood. we have built a general model that can do so for various treatment sites. the presented framework is publicly available at http://github.com/mghro/hedos.",AB_0569
"background biomedical research often involves contextual integration of multimodal and multiomic data in search of mechanisms for improved diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. researchers need to access information from diverse sources, comprising data in various and sometimes incongruent formats. the downstream processing of the data to decipher mechanisms by reconstructing networks and developing quantitative models warrants considerable effort.results metgene is a knowledge-based, gene-centric data aggregator that hierarchically retrieves information about the gene(s), their related pathway(s), reaction(s), metabolite(s), and metabolomic studies from standard data repositories under one dashboard to enable ease of access through centralization of relevant information. we note that metgene focuses only on those genes that encode for proteins directly associated with metabolites. all other gene-metabolite associations are beyond the current scope of metgene. further, the information can be contextualized by filtering by species, anatomy (tissue), and condition (disease or phenotype).conclusions metgene is an open-source tool that aggregates metabolite information for a given gene(s) and presents them in different computable formats (e.g., json) for further integration with other omics studies. metgene is available at https://bdcw.org/metgene/index.php.",AB_0569
"the pathophysiology of long-recognized hematologic abnormalities in ebolavirus (ebov) disease (evd) is unknown. from limited human sampling (of peripheral blood), it has been postulated that emergency hematopoiesis plays a role in severe evd, but the systematic characterization of the bone marrow (bm) has not occurred in human disease or in nonhuman primate models. in a lethal rhesus macaque model of evd, 18 sternal bm samples exposed to the kikwit strain of ebov were compared to those from uninfected controls (n z 3). immunohistochemistry, rnascope in situ hybridization, transmission electron microscopy, and confocal microscopy showed that ebov infects bm monocytes/macrophages and megakaryocytes. ebov exposure was associated with severe bm hypocellularity, including depletion of myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocyte hematopoietic cells. these depletions were negatively correlated with cell proliferation (ki67 expression) and were not associated with bm apoptosis during disease progression. in ebov-infected rhesus macaques with terminal disease, bm showed marked hemophagocytosis, megakaryocyte emperipolesis, and the release of immature hematopoietic cells into the sinusoids. collectively, these data demonstrate not only direct ebov infection of bm monocytes/ macrophages and megakaryocytes but also that disease progression is associated with hematopoietic failure, notably in peripheral cytopenia. these findings inform current pathophysiologic unknowns and suggest a crucial role for bm dysfunction and/or failure, including emergency hematopoiesis, as part of the natural history of severe human disease.

"genome-wide association studies (gwas) have been widely used to identify genetic variation associated with complex traits. despite its success and popularity, the traditional gwas approach comes with a variety of limitations. for this reason, newer methods for gwas have been developed, including the use of pan-genomes instead of a reference genome and the utilization of markers beyond single-nucleotide polymorphisms, such as structural variations and k-mers. the k-mers-based gwas approach has especially gained attention from researchers in recent years. however, these new methodologies can be complicated and challenging to implement. here, we present kgwasflow, a modular, user-friendly, and scalable workflow to perform gwas using k-mers. we adopted an existing kmersgwas method into an easier and more accessible workflow using management tools like snakemake and conda and eliminated the challenges caused by missing dependencies and version conflicts. kgwasflow increases the reproducibility of the kmersgwas method by automating each step with snakemake and using containerization tools like docker. the workflow encompasses supplemental components such as quality control, read-trimming procedures, and generating summary statistics. kgwasflow also offers post-gwas analysis options to identify the genomic location and context of trait-associated k-mers. kgwasflow can be applied to any organism and requires minimal programming skills. kgwasflow is freely available on github (https://github.com/akcorut/kgwasflow) and bioconda (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/kgwasflow).",AB_0569
"developing software tools that leverage biological data sets to accelerate drug discovery is an important aspect of bioinformatic research. here, we present a novel example: a web application called rocket-mir that applies an existing bioinformatic algorithm (intarna) to predict cross-species mirna-mrna interactions and identify human mirnas with potential antimicrobial activity against antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. rocket-mir is the logical extension of our prior finding that human mirna let-7b-5p impairs the ability of the ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa to form biofilms and resist the bactericidal effect of beta-lactam antibiotics. rocket-mir's point and click interface enables researchers without programming expertise to predict additional human-mirna-pathogen interactions. identified mirnas can be developed into novel antimicrobials effective against the 24 clinically relevant pathogens, implicated in diseases of the lung, gut, and other organs, that are included in the application. the paper incorporates three case studies contributed by microbiologists that study human pathogens to demonstrate the usefulness and usability of the application. rocket-mir is accessible at the following link: http://scangeo.dartmouth.edu/rocketmir/.importanceantimicrobial-resistant infections contribute to millions of deaths worldwide every year. in particular, the group of bacteria collectively known as eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter sp.) pathogens are of considerable medical concern due to their virulence and exceptional ability to develop antibiotic resistance. new kinds of antimicrobial therapies are urgently needed to treat patients for whom existing antibiotics are ineffective. the rocket-mir application predicts targets of human mirnas in bacterial and fungal pathogens, rapidly identifying candidate mirna-based antimicrobials. the application's target audience are microbiologists that have the laboratory resources to test the application's predictions. the rocket-mir application currently supports 24 recognized human pathogens that are relevant to numerous diseases including cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), urinary tract infections, and pneumonia. furthermore, the application code was designed to be easily extendible to other human pathogens that commonly cause hospital-acquired infections. antimicrobial-resistant infections contribute to millions of deaths worldwide every year. in particular, the group of bacteria collectively known as eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter sp.) pathogens are of considerable medical concern due to their virulence and exceptional ability to develop antibiotic resistance. new kinds of antimicrobial therapies are urgently needed to treat patients for whom existing antibiotics are ineffective. the rocket-mir application predicts targets of human mirnas in bacterial and fungal pathogens, rapidly identifying candidate mirna-based antimicrobials. the application's target audience are microbiologists that have the laboratory resources to test the application's predictions. the rocket-mir application currently supports 24 recognized human pathogens that are relevant to numerous diseases including cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), urinary tract infections, and pneumonia. furthermore, the application code was designed to be easily extendible to other human pathogens that commonly cause hospital-acquired infections.",AB_0569
"five growth factors [ie, insulin, fibroblast growth factor-2 (fgf-2), stem cell factor, il-3, and stromalderived factor 1a] in combination are necessary for human endothelial cells (ecs) to undergo tube morphogenesis, a process requiring both lumen formation and sprouting behavior. this study investigated why these factors are required by subdividing the factors into 4 separate groups: insulin-only, insulin and fgf-2, no fgf-2 (all factors but without fgf-2), and all factors. the study found that the insulin-only condition failed to support ec morphogenesis or survival, the insulin and fgf-2 condition supported primarily ec lumen formation, and the no fgf-2 condition supported ec sprouting behavior. by comparison, the all-factors condition more strongly stimulated both ec lumen formation and sprouting behavior, and signaling analysis revealed prolonged stimulation of multiple promorphogenic signals coupled with inhibition of proregressive signals. pharmacologic inhibition of jak kinases more selectively blocked ec sprouting behavior, whereas inhibition of raf, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and akt kinases showed selective blockade of lumen formation. inhibition of src family kinases and notch led to increased sprouting coupled to decreased lumen formation, whereas inhibition of pak, mek, and mammalian target of rapamycin kinases blocked both sprouting and lumen formation. these findings reveal novel downstream biological and signaling activities of defined factors that are required for the assembly of human ec-lined capillary tube networks.

"backgroundadvances in sequencing technology and cost reduction have enabled an emergence of various statistical methods used in rna-sequencing data, including the differential co-expression network analysis (or differential network analysis). a key benefit of this method is that it takes into consideration the interactions between or among genes and do not require an established knowledge in biological pathways. as of now, none of existing softwares can incorporate covariates that should be adjusted if they are confounding factors while performing the differential network analysis.resultswe develop an r package prana which a user can easily include multiple covariates. the main r function in this package leverages a novel pseudo-value regression approach for a differential network analysis in rna-sequencing data. this software is also enclosed with complementary r functions for extracting adjusted p-values and coefficient estimates of all or specific variable for each gene, as well as for identifying the names of genes that are differentially connected (dc, hereafter) between subjects under biologically different conditions from the output.conclusionherewith, we demonstrate the application of this package in a real data on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. prana is available through the cran repositories under the gpl-3 license: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/prana/index.html.",AB_0569
"introductiontrust has emerged as a prevalent construct to describe relationships between people and between people and technology in myriad domains. across disciplines, researchers have relied on many different questionnaires to measure trust. the degree to which these questionnaires differ has not been systematically explored. in this paper, we use a word-embedding text analysis technique to identify the differences and common themes across the most used trust questionnaires and provide guidelines for questionnaire selection.methodsa review was conducted to identify the existing trust questionnaires. in total, we included 46 trust questionnaires from three main domains (i.e., automation, humans, and e-commerce) with a total of 626 items measuring different trust layers (i.e., dispositional, learned, and situational). next, we encoded the words within each questionnaire using glove word embeddings and computed the embedding for each questionnaire item, and for each questionnaire. we reduced the dimensionality of the resulting dataset using umap to visualize these embeddings in scatterplots and implemented the visualization in a web app for interactive exploration of the questionnaires (https://areen.shinyapps.io/trust_explorer/).resultsat the word level, the semantic space serves to produce a lexicon of trust-related words. at the item and questionnaire level, the analysis provided recommendation on questionnaire selection based on the dispersion of questionnaires' items and at the domain and layer composition of each questionnaire. along with the web app, the results help explore the semantic space of trust questionnaires and guide the questionnaire selection process.discussionthe results provide a novel means to compare and select trust questionnaires and to glean insights about trust from spoken dialog or written comments.",AB_0569
"we present a new velocity-gauge real-time, time-dependent density functional tight-binding (vg-rttddftb) implementation in the open-source dftb+ software package (https://dftbplus.org) for probing electronic excitations in large, condensed matter systems. our vg-rttddftb approach enables real-time electron dynamics simulations of large, periodic, condensed matter systems containing thousands of atoms with a favorable computational scaling as a function of system size. we provide computational details and benchmark calculations to demonstrate its accuracy and computational parallelizability on a variety of large material systems. as a representative example, we calculate laser-induced electron dynamics in a 512-atom amorphous silicon supercell to highlight the large periodic systems that can be examined with our implementation. taken together, our vg-rttddftb approach enables new electron dynamics simulations of complex systems that require large periodic supercells, such as crystal defects, complex surfaces, nanowires, and amorphous materials.",AB_0569
"persistent homology offers a powerful tool for extracting hidden topological signals from brain networks. it captures the evolution of topological structures across multiple scales, known as filtrations, thereby revealing topological features that persist over these scales. these features are summarized in persistence diagrams, and their dissimilarity is quantified using the wasserstein distance. however, the wasserstein distance does not follow a known distribution, posing challenges for the application of existing parametric statistical models. to tackle this issue, we introduce a unified topological inference framework centered on the wasserstein distance. our approach has no explicit model and distributional assumptions. the inference is performed in a completely data driven fashion. we apply this method to resting-state functional magnetic resonance images (rs-fmri) of temporal lobe epilepsy patients collected from two different sites: the university of wisconsin-madison and the medical college of wisconsin. importantly, our topological method is robust to variations due to sex and image acquisition, obviating the need to account for these variables as nuisance covariates. we successfully localize the brain regions that contribute the most to topological differences. a matlab package used for all analyses in this study is available at https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/ph-stat.",AB_0569
