"background: there is a pressing need for improved methods to identify effective therapeutics for diseases. many computational approaches have been developed to repurpose existing drugs to meet this need. however, these tools often output long lists of candidate drugs that are difficult to interpret, and individual drug candidates may suffer from unknown off-target effects. we reasoned that an approach which aggregates information from multiple drugs that share a common mechanism of action (moa) would increase on-target signal compared to evaluating drugs on an individual basis. in this study, we present drug mechanism enrichment analysis (dmea), an adaptation of gene set enrichment analysis (gsea), which groups drugs with shared moas to improve the prioritization of drug repurposing candidates. results: first, we tested dmea on simulated data and showed that it can sensitively and robustly identify an enriched drug moa. next, we used dmea on three types of rank-ordered drug lists: (1) perturbagen signatures based on gene expression data, (2) drug sensitivity scores based on high-throughput cancer cell line screening, and (3) molecular classification scores of intrinsic and acquired drug resistance. in each case, dmea detected the expected moa as well as other relevant moas. furthermore, the rankings of moas generated by dmea were better than the original single-drug rankings in all tested data sets. finally, in a drug discovery experiment, we identified potential senescence-inducing and senolytic drug moas for primary human mammary epithelial cells and then experimentally validated the senolytic effects of egfr inhibitors. conclusions: dmea is a versatile bioinformatic tool that can improve the prioritization of candidates for drug repurposing. by grouping drugs with a shared moa, dmea increases on-target signal and reduces off-target effects compared to analysis of individual drugs. dmea is publicly available as both a web application and an r package at https://belindabgarana.github.io/dmea.",AB_0611
"macromolecular interactions regulate all aspects of biology. the identification of interacting partners and complexes is important for understanding cellular processes, host-pathogen conflicts, and organismal development. multiple methods exist to label and enrich interacting proteins in living cells. notably, the soybean ascorbate peroxidase, apex2, rapidly biotinylates adjacent biomolecules in the presence of biotin-phenol and hydrogen peroxide. however, during initial experiments with this system, we found that apex2 exhibits a cytoplasmic-biased localization and is sensitive to the nuclear export inhibitor lepto-mycin b (lmb). this led us to identify a putative nuclear export signal (nes) at the carboxy-terminus of apex2 (nesapex2), structurally adjacent to the conserved heme binding site. this putative nes is functional as evidenced by cytoplasmic localization and lmb sensitivity of a mcherry-nesapex2 chimeric construct. single amino acid substitutions of multiple hydrophobic residues within nesapex2 eliminate cytoplasm-biased localization of both mcherry-nesapex2 as well as full-length apex2. however, all but one of these nes substitutions also compromises peroxide-dependent labeling. this unique separation-of-function mutant, apex2-l242a, is termed apex3. localization and functionality of apex3 are confirmed by fusion to the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling transcriptional factor, rela. apex3 is there-fore an optimized tool for unbiased proximity labeling of cellular proteins and interacting factors.. & copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://crea-tivecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0611
"access to computationally based visualization tools to navigate chemical space has become more important due to the increasing size and diversity of publicly accessible databases, associated compendiums of high-throughput screening (hts) results, and other descriptor and effects data. however, application of these techniques requires advanced programming skills that are beyond the capabilities of many stakeholders. here we report the development of the second version of the chemmaps.com webserver (https://sandbox. ntp.niehs.nih.gov/chemmaps/) focused on environmental chemical space. the chemical space of chemmaps.com v2.0, released in 2022, now includes approximately one million environmental chemicals from the epa distributed structure-searchable toxicity (dsstox) inventory. chemmaps.com v2.0 incorporates mapping of hts assay data from the u.s. federal tox21 research collaboration program, which includes results from around 2000 assays tested on up to 10 000 chemicals. as a case example, we showcased chemical space navigation for perfluorooctanoic acid (pfoa), part of the per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas) chemical family, which are of significant concern for their potential effects on human health and the environment.",AB_0611
"motivation: as the resolution of metagenomic analysis increases, the evolution of microbial genomes in longitudinal metagenomic data has become a research focus. some software has been developed for the simulation of complex microbial communities at the strain level. however, the tool for simulating within-strain evolutionary signals in longitudinal samples is still lacking.results: in this study, we introduce stemsim, a user-friendly command-line simulator of short-term evolutionary mutations for longitudinal metagenomic data. the input is simulated longitudinal raw sequencing reads of microbial communities or single species. the output is the modified reads with within-strain evolutionary mutations and the relevant information of these mutations. stemsim will be of great use for the evaluation of analytic tools that detect short-term evolutionary mutations in metagenomic data.availability and implementation: stemsim and its tutorial are freely available online at https://github.com/boyanzhou/stemsim.",AB_0611
"predicting protein localization and understanding its mechanisms are critical in biology and pathology. in this context, we propose a new web application of mulocdeep with improved performance, result interpretation, and visualization. by transferring the original model into species-specific models, mulocdeep achieved competitive prediction performance at the subcellular level against other state-of-the-art methods. it uniquely provides a comprehensive localization prediction at the suborganellar level. besides prediction, our web service quantifies the contribution of single amino acids to localization for individual proteins; for a group of proteins, common motifs or potential targeting-related regions can be derived. furthermore, the visualizations of targeting mechanism analyses can be downloaded for publication ready figures. the mulocdeep web service is available at https://www.mu-loc.org/.",AB_0611
"several atlasing efforts aim to profile human gene and protein expression across tissues, cell types and cell lines in normal physiology, development and disease. one utility of these resources is to examine the expression of a single gene across all cell types, tissues and cell lines in each atlas. however, there is currently no centralized place that integrates data from several atlases to provide this type of data in a uniform format for visualization, analysis and download, and via an application programming interface. to address this need, generanger is a web server that provides access to processed data about gene and protein expression across normal human cell types, tissues and cell lines from several atlases. at the same time, targetranger is a related web server that takes as input rna-seq data from profiled human cells and tissues, and then compares the uploaded input data to expression levels across the atlases to identify genes that are highly expressed in the input and lowly expressed across normal hu-man cell types and tissues. identified targets can be filtered by transmembrane or secreted proteins. the results from generanger and targetranger are visualized as box and scatter plots, and as interactive tables. generanger and targetranger are available from https://generanger.maayanlab.cloud and https://targetranger.maayanlab.cloud, respectively.",AB_0611
"gene and protein set enrichment analysis is a critical step in the analysis of data collected from omics experiments. enrichr is a popular gene set enrichment analysis web-server search engine that contains hundreds of thousands of annotated gene sets. while enrichr has been useful in providing enrichment analysis with many gene set libraries from different categories, integrating enrichment results across libraries and domains of knowledge can further hypothesis generation. to this end, enrichr-kg is a knowledge graph database and a web-server application that combines selected gene set libraries from enrichr for integrative enrichment analysis and visualization. the enrichment results are presented as subgraphs made of nodes and links that connect genes to their enriched terms. in addition, users of enrichr-kg can add gene-gene links, as well as predicted genes to the subgraphs. this graphical representation of cross-library results with enriched and predicted genes can illuminate hidden associa-tions between genes and annotated enriched terms from across datasets and resources. enrichr-kg cur-rently serves 26 gene set libraries from different categories that include transcription, pathways, on-tologies, diseases/drugs, and cell types. to demon-strate the utility of enrichr-kg we provide several case studies. enrichr-kg is freely available at: https://maayanlab.cloud/enrichr-kg.",AB_0611
"background: in a previous paper, we classified populated hla class i alleles into supertypes and subtypes based on the similarity of 3d landscape of peptide binding grooves, using newly defined structure distance metric and hierarchical clustering approach. compared to other approaches, our method achieves higher correlation with peptide binding specificity, intra-cluster similarity (cohesion), and robustness. here we introduce hla-clus, a python package for clustering hla class i alleles using the method we developed recently and describe additional features including a new nearest neighbor clustering method that facilitates clustering based on user-defined criteria.results: the hla-clus pipeline includes three stages: first, hla class i structural models are coarse grained and transformed into clouds of labeled points. second, similarities between alleles are determined using a newly defined structure distance metric that accounts for spatial and physicochemical similarities. finally, alleles are clustered via hierarchical or nearest-neighbor approaches. we also interfaced hla-clus with the peptide:hla affinity predictor mhcnuggets. by using the nearest neighbor clustering method to select optimal allele-specific deep learning models in mhcnuggets, the average accuracy of peptide binding prediction of rare alleles was improved.conclusions: the hla-clus package offers a solution for characterizing the peptide binding specificities of a large number of hla alleles. this method can be applied in hla functional studies, such as the development of peptide affinity predictors, disease association studies, and hla matching for grafting. hla-clus is freely available at our github repository (https://github.com/yshen25/hla-clus).",AB_0611
"we present a new method and software tool called rowbowt that applies a pangenome index to the problem of inferring genotypes from short-read sequencing data. the method uses a novel indexing structure called the marker array. using the marker array, we can genotype variants with respect from large panels like the 1000 genomes project while reducing the reference bias that results when aligning to a single linear reference. rowbowt can infer accurate genotypes in less time and memory compared to existing graph-based methods. the method is implemented in the open source software tool rowbowt available at https://github.com/alshai/rowbowt.",AB_0611
"motivation: enrichment analysis is a widely utilized technique in genomic analysis that aims to determine if there is a statistically significant association between two sets of genomic features. to conduct this type of hypothesis testing, an appropriate null model is typically required. however, the null distribution that is commonly used can be overly simplistic and may result in inaccurate conclusions. results: bootranges provides fast functions for generation of block bootstrapped genomic ranges representing the null hypothesis in enrichment analysis. as part of a modular workflow, bootranges offers greater flexibility for computing various test statistics leveraging other bioconductor packages. we show that shuffling or permutation schemes may result in overly narrow test statistic null distributions and over-estimation of statistical significance, while creating new range sets with a block bootstrap preserves local genomic correlation structure and generates more reliable null distributions. it can also be used in more complex analyses, such as accessing correlations between cis-regulatory elements (cres) and genes across cell types or providing optimized thresholds, e.g. log fold change (logfc) from differential analysis. availability and implementation: bootranges is freely available in the r/bioconductor package nullranges hosted at https://bioconductor.org/packages/nullranges.",AB_0611
