"we generalize the recently proposed stepped partially acoustic dark matter (spartacous) model by including additional massless degrees of freedom in the dark radiation sector. we fit spartacous and its generalization against cosmological precision data from the cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, large-scale structure, supernovae type ia, and cepheid variables. we find that spartacous significantly reduces the h-0 tension but does not provide any meaningful improvement of the s-8 tension, while the generalized model succeeds in addressing both tensions, and provides a better fit than lambda cdm and other dark sector models proposed to address the same tensions. in the generalized model, h-0 can be raised to 71.4km/s/mpc (the 95% upper limit), reducing the tension, if the fitted data does not include the direct measurement from the sh0es collaboration, and to 73.7km/s/mpc (95% upper limit) if it does. a version of class that has been modified to analyze this model is publicly available at https://github.com/manuelbuenabad/class_spartacous.",AB_0556
"analysis and interpretation of high-throughput transcriptional and chromatin accessibility data at single-cell (sc) resolution are still open challenges in the biomedical field. the existence of countless bioinformatics tools, for the different analytical steps, increases the complexity of data interpretation and the difficulty to derive biological insights. in this article, we present scala, a bioinformatics tool for analysis and visualization of single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scatac-seq) data-sets, enabling either independent or integrative analysis of the two modalities. scala combines standard types of analysis by integrating multiple software packages varying from quality control to the identification of distinct cell populations and cell states. additional analysis options enable functional enrichment, cellular trajectory inference, ligand-receptor analysis, and regulatory network reconstruction. scala is fully parameterizable, presenting data in tabular format and producing publication-ready visualizations. the different available analysis modules can aid biomedical researchers in exploring, analyzing, and visualizing their data without any prior experience in coding. we demonstrate the functionality of scala through two use-cases related to tnf-driven arthritic mice, handling both scrna-seq and scatac-seq datasets. scala is developed in r, shiny and javascript and is mainly available as a standalone version, while an online service of more limited capacity can be found at http://scala.pavlopouloslab.info or https://scala.fleming.gr.",AB_0556
"here, we introduce the third release of kalium database (http://kaliumdb.org/), a manually curated comprehensive depository that accumulates data on polypeptide ligands of potassium channels. the major goal of this amplitudinous update is to summarize findings for natural polypeptide ligands of k+ channels, as well as data for the artificial derivatives of these substances obtained over the decades of exploration. we manually analyzed more than 700 original manuscripts and systematized the information on mutagenesis, production of radio- and fluorescently labeled derivatives, and the molecular pharmacology of k+ channel ligands. as a result, data on more than 1200 substances were processed and added enriching the database content fivefold. we also included the electrophysiological data obtained on the understudied and neglected k+ channels including the heteromeric and concatenated channels. we associated target channels in kalium with corresponding entries in the official database of the international union of basic and clinical pharmacology. kalium was supplemented with an adaptive statistics page, where users are able to obtain actual data output. several other improvements were introduced, such as a color code to distinguish the range of ligand activity concentrations and advanced tools for filtration and sorting. kalium is a fully open-access database, crosslinked to other databases of interest. it can be utilized as a convenient resource containing ample up-to-date information about polypeptide ligands of k+ channels.",AB_0556
"human pluripotent stem cells (hpscs) hold a central role in studying human development, in disease modeling and in regenerative medicine. these cells not only acquire genetic modifications when kept in culture, but they may also harbor epigenetic aberrations, mainly involving parental imprinting and x-chromosome inactivation. here we present a detailed bioinformatic protocol for detecting such aberrations using rna sequencing data. we provide a pipeline designed to process and analyze rna sequencing data for the identification of abnormal biallelic expression of imprinted genes, and thus detect loss of imprinting. furthermore, we show how to differentiate among x-chromosome inactivation, full activation and aberrant erosion of x chromosome in female hpscs. in addition to providing bioinformatic tools, we discuss the impact of such epigenetic variations in hpscs on their utility for various purposes. this pipeline can be used by any user with basic understanding of the linux command line. it is available on github as a software container (https://github.com/gal-keshet/epityping) and produces reliable results in 1-4 d. this protocol provides a step-by-step procedure to infer the presence of epigenetic aberrations in human pluripotent stem cells from rna sequencing data, specifically focusing on the identification of imprinting and x-inactivation status.the pipeline provides a simple and easy-to-use methodology for the reliable identification of gene- and locus-specific loss-of-imprinting events as well as the accurate discrimination among different x-inactivation statuses. the authors describe an easy-to-follow bioinformatic pipeline, called epityping, for the identification of abnormal biallelic expression of imprinted genes and the analysis of the x-chromosome inactivation state from rna sequencing data obtained from human pluripotent stem cells.",AB_0556
"motivation annotations of biochemical models provide details of chemical species, documentation of chemical reactions, and other essential information. unfortunately, the vast majority of biochemical models have few, if any, annotations, or the annotations provide insufficient detail to understand the limitations of the model. the quality and quantity of annotations can be improved by developing tools that recommend annotations. for example, recommender tools have been developed for annotations of genes. although annotating genes is conceptually similar to annotating biochemical models, there are important technical differences that make it difficult to directly apply this prior work.results we present amas, a system that predicts annotations for elements of models represented in the systems biology markup language (sbml) community standard. we provide a general framework for predicting model annotations for a query element based on a database of annotated reference elements and a match score function that calculates the similarity between the query element and reference elements. the framework is instantiated to specific element types (e.g. species, reactions) by specifying the reference database (e.g. chebi for species) and the match score function (e.g. string similarity). we analyze the computational efficiency and prediction quality of amas for species and reactions in bigg and biomodels and find that it has subsecond response times and accuracy between 80% and 95% depending on specifics of what is predicted. we have incorporated amas into an open-source, pip-installable python package that can run as a command-line tool that predicts and adds annotations to species and reactions to an sbml model.availability and implementation our project is hosted at https://github.com/sys-bio/amas, where we provide examples, documentation, and source code files. our source code is licensed under the mit open-source license.",AB_0556
"background: one in ten newborn children is born prematurely. the elongated length of stay (los) of these children in the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) has important implications on hospital occupancy figures, healthcare and management costs, as well as the psychology of parents. in order to allow accurate planning and resource allocation, this study aims to create a generalizable and robust model to predict the nicu los of preterm newborns. methods: data were collected from a large tertiary center nicu between 2011 and 2018 and relates to 5,362 newborns. the selected model was externally validated using a data set of 8,768 newborns from another tertiary center nicu. this report compares several models, such as random forest (rf), quantile rf, and other feature selection methods, including lasso and aic step-forward selection. in addition, a novel step-forward selection based on false discovery rate (fdr) for quantile regression is presented and evaluated.results: a high-order quantile regression model for predicting preterm newborns' los that uses only four features available at birth had more attractive properties than other richer ones. the model achieved a mean absolute error (mae) of 6.26 days on the internal validation set (average los 27.04) and an mae of 6.04 days on the external validation set (average los 29.32). the suggested model surpassed the accuracy obtained by models in the literature. it is shown empirically that the fdr-based selection has better properties than the aic-based step forward selection approach. conclusion: this paper demonstrates a process to create a predictive model for nicu los in preterm newborns, where each step is reasoned. we obtain a simple and robust model for nicu los prediction, which achieves far better results than the current model used for financing nicus. utilizing this model, we have created an easy-to use online web application to ease parents' worries and to assist nicu management: https://tzviel.shinyapps.io/ calculos.",AB_0556
"mutations in the cln5 gene cause the fatal, pediatric, neurodegenerative disease cln5 neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. affected children suffer progressive neuronal loss, visual failure and premature death. presently there is no treatment. this study evaluated dual intracerebroventricular (icv) and intravitreal (ivt) administration of a self-complementary adeno-associated viral vector encoding ovine cln5 (scaav9/ocln5) into cln5 affected sheep (cln5(-/-)) at various disease stages. cln5 disease progression was slowed in pre-symptomatic sheep who received a moderate dose of scaav9/ocln5, whilst a higher icv dose treatment in early and advanced symptomatic animals delayed or halted disease progression. intracranial (brain) volume loss was attenuated in all treatment cohorts, and visual function was also sustained in both the early and advanced symptomatic treated sheep over the 24-month duration of the study. robust cln5 protein expression was detected throughout the brain and spinal cord, and improvements in central nervous system and retinal disease correlates were observed. these findings hold translational promise for extending and improving the quality of life in both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic cln5 patients, and prompted the initiation of the first in-human phase i/ii clinical trial testing icv/ivt administration of scaav9 encoding human cln5 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/; nct05228145).",AB_0556
"dementia is a debilitating neurological condition which impairs the cognitive function and the ability to take care of oneself. the clock drawing test (cdt) is widely used to detect dementia, but differentiating normal from borderline cases requires years of clinical experience. misclassifying mild abnormal as normal will delay the chance to investigate for potential reversible causes or slow down the progression. to help address this issue, we propose an automatic cdt scoring system that adopts attentive pairwise interaction network (api-net), a fine-grained deep learning model that is designed to distinguish visually similar images. inspired by how humans often learn to recognize different objects by looking at two images side-by-side, api-net is optimized using image pairs in a contrastive manner, as opposed to standard supervised learning, which optimizes a model using individual images. in this study, we extend api-net to infer shulman cdt scores from a dataset of 3108 subjects. we compare the performance of api-net to that of convolutional neural networks: vgg16, resnet-152, and densenet-121. the best api-net achieves an f1-score of 0.79, which is a 3% absolute improvement over resnet-152's f1-score of 0.76. the code for api-net and the dataset used have been made available at https://github.com/cccnlab/cdt-api-network .",AB_0556
"the metagenome of bacteria colonizing the human intestine is a set of genes that is almost 150 times greater than the set of host genes. some of these genes encode enzymes whose functioning significantly expands the number of potential pathways for xenobiotic metabolism. the resulting metabolites can exhibit activity different from that of the parent compound. this can decrease the efficacy of pharmacotherapy as well as induce undesirable and potentially life-threatening side effects. thus, analysis of the biotransformation of small drug-like compounds mediated by the gut microbiota is an important step in the development of new pharmaceutical agents and repurposing of the approved drugs. in vitro research, the interaction of drug-like compounds with the gut microbiota is a multistep and time-consuming process. systematic testing of large sets of chemical structures is associated with a number of challenges, including the lack of standardized techniques and significant financial costs to identify the structure of the final metabolites. estimation of the compounds' ability to be biotransformed by the gut microbiota and prediction of the structures of their metabolites are possible in silico. however, the development of computational approaches is limited by the lack of information about chemical structures metabolized by microbiota enzymes. the aim of this study is to create a database containing information on the metabolism of drug-like compounds by the gut microbiota. we created the data set containing information about 368 structures metabolized and 310 structures not metabolized by the human gut microbiota. the hgmmx database is freely available at https://www.way2drug.com/hgmmx. the information presented will be useful in the development of computational approaches for analyzing the impact of the human microbiota on metabolism of drug-like molecules.",AB_0556
"background: during lifespan of reverse osmosis systems applied in seawater desalination plants, a common phenomenon of undesirable growth and accumulation of biological material known as biofouling occurs. microbial cells are first settlers, attaching and enclosing themselves in extracellular polymeric substances -biomass accumulation usually referred to as microfouling or biofilms, which becomes a serious issue when having a detrimental effect on materials or hampering industrial processes. thus, control of microfouling on reverse osmosis membranes is crucial since chemical and physical treatments are usually costly and ineffective. in this context, even though microorganisms are the source of the problem, they can also provide possible solutions due to their capacity to produce secondary metabolites, being several of these competition mediators secreted compounds (i.e., bioactive molecules) produced during the stationary phase (e.g., lipases, proteases, dnases and other enzymes with alginate lyase and xanthine oxidases). such bioactive substances can be utilized against the development of biofilms. considering biofouled surfaces a niche for complex microbial interactions, here we have used reverse osmosis membranes and cartridge filters applied in a seawater desalination plant as a source for the isolation of bacteria with anti-fouling potential, among other biotechnological applications.results: we obtained 27 bacterial isolates able to secrete exoenzymes displaying a wide array of bioactivity such as lipases, alginases, and glucosidases, among others. additionally, we showed two main candidates able to inhibit the growth of common microbial colonizers of rom and cartridge filter.conclusions: these results highlight the potential biotechnological application of bioactive molecules against biofouling formation. how to cite: vera-villalobos h, cortes-martinez a, gonzalez-gutierrez a, et al. reverse osmosis membranes applied in seawater desalination plants as a source of bacteria with antifouling activity: isolation, biochemical and molecular characterization. electron j biotechnol 2023;66. https://doi.org/ 10.1016/j.ejbt.2023.09.003.(c) 2023 pontificia universidad catolica de valparaiso. production and hosting by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0556
