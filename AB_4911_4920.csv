"background: in return for their nutritional properties and broad availability, cereal crops have been associated with different alimentary disorders and symptoms, with the majority of the responsibility being attributed to gluten. therefore, the research of gluten-related literature data continues to be produced at ever-growing rates, driven in part by the recent exploratory studies that link gluten to non-traditional diseases and the popularity of gluten-free diets, making it increasingly difficult to access and analyse practical and structured information. in this sense, the accelerated discovery of novel advances in diagnosis and treatment, as well as exploratory studies, produce a favourable scenario for disinformation and misinformation.objectives: aligned with, the european union strategy delivering on eu food safety and nutrition in 2050 & prime;& prime; which emphasizes the inextricable links between imbalanced diets, the increased exposure to unreliable sources of information and misleading information, and the increased dependency on reliable sources of information; this paper presents glutknois, a public and interactive literature-based database that reconstructs and represents the experimental biomedical knowledge extracted from the gluten-related literature. the developed platform includes different external database knowledge, bibliometrics statistics and social media discussion to propose a novel and enhanced way to search, visualise and analyse potential biomedical and health-related interactions in relation to the gluten domain.methods: for this purpose, the presented study applies a semi-supervised curation workflow that combines natural language processing techniques, machine learning algorithms, ontology-based normalization and integration approaches, named entity recognition methods, and graph knowledge reconstruction methodologies to process, classify, represent and analyse the experimental findings contained in the literature, which is also complemented by data from the social discussion.results and conclusions: in this sense, 5814 documents were manually annotated and 7424 were fully automatically processed to reconstruct the first online gluten-related knowledge database of evidenced health-related interactions that produce health or metabolic changes based on the literature. in addition, the automatic processing of the literature combined with the knowledge representation methodologies proposed has the potential to assist in the revision and analysis of years of gluten research. the reconstructed knowledge base is public and accessible at https://sing-group.org/glutknois/",AB_0492
"instrumental measurements of wind speed and direction from the 1920s to the 1940s from 13 stations in sweden have been rescued and digitized, making 165 additional station years of wind data available through the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute's open data portal. these stations measured wind through different versions of cup-type anemometers and were mainly situated at lighthouses along the coasts and at airports. the work followed the protocol guidelines on best practices for climate data rescue of the world meteorological organization consisting of (i) designing a template for digitization, (ii) digitizing records in paper journals by a scanner, (iii) typing numbers of wind speed and direction data into the template, and (iv) performing quality control of the raw observation data. along with the digitization of the wind observations, meta data from the stations were collected and compiled as support to the following quality control and homogenization of the wind data. the meta data mainly consist of changes in observer and a small number of changes in instrument types and positions. the rescue of these early wind observations can help improve our understanding of long-term wind changes and multidecadal variability (e.g. the stilling vs. reversal phenomena) but also to evaluate and assess climate simulations of the past. digitized data can be accessed through the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute and the following zenodo repository:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5850264 (zhouet al., 2022) .",AB_0492
"in our constantly monitored world, surveillance cameras play a crucial role in curbing crime and violence in public spaces by serving as a deterrent. to enhance their effectiveness, there is a growing need for automated tools that can detect crimes in real time. in this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture that accurately and efficiently detects violent crimes in surveillance videos. we rely on what we believe are the most essential pieces of information to detect violence, namely: human bodies and their interaction. to this end, we employ human pose extractors and change detectors as the input of our proposal. subsequently, we combine them using a novel method, which relies on additions instead of multiplications to guarantee the transmission of information even when one of the inputs provides a zero-valued signal; outperforming other combination alternatives of the literature. finally, to account for both spatial and temporal information, we use a convolutional alternative of the standard lstm, the convlstm. the experiments performed on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposal, achieving state-of-the-art results with much fewer trainable parameters. we release the code to replicate the proposed architecture at https://github.com/atmguille/violence-detection-with-human-skeletons.",AB_0492
"analysis pipelines in genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics commonly produce lists of genes, e.g., differentially expressed genes. often these lists overlap only partly or not at all and contain too many genes for manual comparison. however, using background knowledge, such as the functional annotations of the genes, the lists can be abstracted to functional terms. one approach is to run gene ontology (go) enrichment analyses to determine over- and/or underrepresented functions for every list of genes. due to the hierarchical structure of the gene ontology, lists of enriched go terms can contain many closely related terms, rendering the lists still long, redundant, and difficult to interpret for researchers.in this paper, we present go-compass (gene ontology list comparison using semantic similarity), a visual analytics tool for the dispensability reduction and visual comparison of lists of go terms. for dispensability reduction, we adapted the re-vigo algorithm, a summarization method based on the semantic similarity of go terms, to perform hierarchical dispensability clustering on multiple lists. in an interactive dashboard, go-compass offers several visualizations for the comparison and improved interpretability of go terms lists. the hierarchical dispensability clustering is visualized as a tree, where users can interactively filter out dispensable go terms and create flat clusters by cutting the tree at a chosen dispensability. the flat clusters are visualized in animated treemaps and are compared using a correlation heatmap, upset plots, and bar charts. with two use cases on published datasets from different omics domains, we demonstrate the general applicability and effectiveness of our approach. in the first use case, we show how the tool can be used to compare lists of differentially expressed genes from a transcriptomics pipeline and incorporate gene information into the analysis. in the second use case using genomics data, we show how go-compass facilitates the analysis of many hundreds of go terms. for qualitative evaluation of the tool, we conducted feedback sessions with five domain experts and received positive comments. go-compass is part of the tue-vis visualization server as a web application available at https://go-compass-tuevis.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/",AB_0492
"introduction family caregivers provide by far the largest share of long-term, unpaid care for their primarily elderly and chronically ill relatives or friends. this is associated with a higher risk of psychological and physical overload for the caregivers due to the persistently high time, financial and emotional burden. recognising the effects of persistent burden on caring relatives at an early stage significantly contributes to the appropriate coordination of available resources and mediation of individual support to maintain a functional caring relationship without excessive demands. general practitioners are usually responsible for the early detection of burden arising from informal care and the coordination of adequate measures. the objective of this review is to give an overview of instruments to identify and measure (over)burden of caring relatives in german general practice and to describe their characteristics. methods and analysis we used the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses extension for scoping reviews (prisma-scr) checklist in addition to the joanna briggs institute reviewer's manual to describe the aims and methods of the planned scoping reviews. this protocol has been registered with open science framework (osf), https://osf.io/9ce2k. two reviewers will run the search to identify studies in four databases (pubmed, livivo, the cochrane library and cinahl) in june and july 2023. abstracts, titles and full-text publications will be screened to extract data from each included study using a data extraction form. additionally, an overview of all studies including main study characteristics and detailed information on identification instruments will be given to map the different instruments and tools and to clarify statements concerning their use and practicability in general practice. ethics and dissemination ethical approval or consent to participate is not required, as data in this study consists of published studies and not individual data from human or animal participants. dissemination will consist of publications, presentations and other knowledge translation activities.",AB_0492
"in humans, the biosynthesis and trafficking of mitochondrial [4fe-4s]2+ clusters is a highly coordinated process that requires a complex protein machinery. in a mitochondrial pathway among various proposed to biosynthesize nascent [4fe-4s]2+ clusters, two [2fe-2s]2+ clusters are converted into a [4fe-4s]2+ cluster on a isca1-isca2 complex. along this pathway, this cluster is then mobilized from this complex to mitochondrial apo recipient proteins with the assistance of accessory proteins. nfu1 is the accessory protein that first receives the [4fe-4s]2+ cluster from isca1-isca2 complex. a structural view of the pro-tein-protein recognition events occurring along the [4fe-4s]2+ cluster trafficking as well as how the glob-ular n-terminal and c-terminal domains of nfu1 act in such process is, however, still elusive. here, we applied small-angle x-ray scattering coupled with on-line size-exclusion chromatography and paramag-netic nmr to disclose structural snapshots of isca1-, isca2-and nfu1-containing apo complexes as well as the coordination of [4fe-4s]2+ cluster bound to the isca1-nfu1 complex, which is the terminal stable species of the [4fe-4s]2+ cluster transfer pathway involving isca1-, isca2-and nfu1 proteins. the structural modelling of isca1-isca2, isca1-isca2-nfu1 and isca1-nfu1 apo complexes, here reported, reveals that the structural plasticity of nfu1 domains is crucial to drive protein partner recogni-tion and modulate [4fe-4s]2+ cluster transfer from the cluster-assembly site in the isca1-isca2 complex to a cluster-binding site in the isca1-nfu1 complex. these structures allowed us to provide a first rational for the molecular function of the n-domain of nfu1, which can act as a modulator in the [4fe-4s]2+ cluster transfer.& copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://crea-tivecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0492
"background: dietary patterns can produce an environmental impact. changes in people's diet, such as the increased consumption of ultra-processed food (upf) can not only influence human health but also environment sustainability. objectives: assessment of the impact of 2-year changes in upf consumption on greenhouse gas emissions and water, energy and land use. design: a 2-year longitudinal study after a dietary intervention including 5879 participants from a southern european population between the ages of 55-75 years with metabolic syndrome. methods: food intake was assessed using a validated 143-item food frequency questionnaire, which allowed classifying foods according to the nova system. in addition, sociodemographic data, mediterranean diet adherence, and physical activity were obtained from validated questionnaires. greenhouse gas emissions, water, energy and land use were cal-culated by means of the agribalyse & reg; 3.0.1 database of environmental impact indicators for food items. changes in upf consumption during a 2-year period were analyzed. statistical analyses were conducted using computed general lin-ear models. results: participants with major reductions in their upf consumption reduced their impact by -0.6 kg of co2eq and -5.3 mj of energy. water use was the only factor that increased as the percentage of upf was reduced. conclusions: low consumption of ultra-processed foods may contribute to environmental sustainability. the processing level of the consumed food should be considered not only for nutritional advice on health but also for environmental protection. trial registration: isrctn, isrctn89898870. registered 05 september 2013, http://www.isrctn.com/ isrctn89898870.",AB_0492
"we present gepi, a novel web server for large-scale text mining of molecular interactions from the scientific biomedical literature. gepi leverages natural language processing techniques to identify genes and related entities, interactions between those entities and biomolecular events involving them. gepi supports rapid retrieval of interactions based on powerful search options to contextualize queries targeting (lists of) genes of interest. contextualization is enabled by full-text filters constraining the search for interactions to either sentences or paragraphs, with or without pre-defined gene lists. our knowledge graph is updated several times a week ensuring the most recent information to be available at all times. the result page provides an overview of the outcome of a search, with accompanying interaction statistics and visualizations. a table (downloadable in excel format) gives direct access to the retrieved interaction pairs, together with information about the molecular entities, the factual certainty of the interactions (as verbatim expressed by the authors), and a text snippet from the original document that verbalizes each interaction. in summary, our web application offers free, easy-to-use, and up-to-date monitoring of gene and protein interaction information, in company with flexible query formulation and filtering options. gepi is available at https://gepi.coling.uni-jena.de/.

"crispr/cas9 gene editing has revolutionised loss- of-function experiments in leishmania, the causative agent of leishmaniasis. as leishmania lack a functional non-homologous dna end joining pathway however, obtaining null mutants typically requires additional donor dna, selection of drug resistance-associated edits or time-consuming isolation of clones. genome- wide loss- of-function screens across different conditions and across multiple leishmania species are therefore unfeasible at present. here, we report a crispr/cas9 cytosine base editor (cbe) toolbox that overcomes these limitations. we employed cbes in leishmania to introduce stop codons by converting cytosine into thymine and created http://www.leishbaseedit.net/ for cbe primer design in kinetoplastids. through reporter assays and by targeting single-and multi- copy genes in l. mexi-cana, l. major, l. donovani, and l. infantum, we demonstrate how this tool can efficiently generate functional null mutants by expressing just one single- guide rna, reaching up to 100% editing rate in non-clonal populations. we then generated a leishmania- optimised cbe and successfully targeted an essential gene in a plasmid library delivered loss- of-function screen in l. mexicana. since our method does not require dna double-strand breaks, homologous recombination, donor dna, or isolation of clones, we believe that this enables for the first time functional genetic screens in leish-mania via delivery of plasmid libraries.",AB_0492
"rna-sequencing has become one of the most used high-throughput approaches to gain knowledge about the expression of all different rna subpopulations. however, technical artifacts, either introduced during library preparation and/or data analysis, can influence the detected rna expression levels. a critical step, especially in large and low input datasets or studies, is data normalization, which aims at eliminating the variability in data that is not related to biology. many normalization methods have been developed, each of them relying on different assumptions, making the selection of the appropriate normalization strategy key to preserve biological information. to address this, we developed normseq, a free web-server tool to systematically assess the performance of normalization methods in a given dataset. a key feature of normseq is the implementation of information gain to guide the selection of the best normalization method, which is crucial to eliminate or at least reduce non-biological variability. altogether, normseq provides an easy-to-use platform to explore different aspects of gene expression data with a special focus on data normalization to help researchers, even without bioinformatics expertise, to obtain reliable biological inference from their data. normseq is freely available at: https://arn.ugr.es/normseq.",AB_0492
