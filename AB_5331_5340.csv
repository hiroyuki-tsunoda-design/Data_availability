"in this article, i present a very fast and high-precision (up to 33 decimal places) c++ implementation of the semi-global time propagation algorithm for a system of coupled schrodinger equations with a time-dependent hamiltonian. it can be used to describe time-dependent processes in molecular systems after excitation by femto-and attosecond laser pulses. it also works with an arbitrary user supplied hamiltonian and can be used for nonlinear problems. the semi-global algorithm is briefly presented, the c++ implementation is described and five sample simulations are shown. the accompanying c++ source code package is included. the high precision benchmark (long double and float128) shows the estimated calculation costs. the presented method turns out to be faster and more accurate than the global chebyshev propagator.program summaryprogram title: semiglobalcppcpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /429rszyc65 .1developer's repository link: http://gitlab .com /cosurgi /semiglobalcpplicensing provisions: gnu general public license 2programming language: c++nature of problem: the femto-and attosecond chemistry requires fast and high precision computation tools for quantum dynamics. conventional software has problems with providing high precision calculation results (up to 33 significant digits), especially when the computation has to be as fast as possible.solution method: this software fills in the gap by providing the semi-global algorithm [1-3] for arbitrary number of coupled electronic states for the time dependent hamiltonian and nonlinear inhomogeneous source term. it is implemented in a way that allows computation with precision of 15, 18 or 33 significant digits, where the computation speed can be directly controlled by setting the required error tolerance. the semi-global algorithm [1-3] is implemented in c++ providing a 10x speed boost compared to original publication of semi-global algorithm implemented in matlab/octave [1-3].& copy; 2023 the author. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ( .org /licenses /by /4 .0/).",AB_0534
"although they are among the most researched real world engineering design problems, it is encountered with significant problems in the optimization of structural truss bar problems (tps). the main reasons for these problems are (i) the studies on the optimization of tps being carried out with different experimental settings, (ii) the competitor algorithms used in the optimization process being insufficient, and (iii) the stability analysis and computational complexity information of the algorithms are not investigated. it is designed a simulation environment with defined standards and a benchmarking suite consisting of nine tps of three different types in order to eliminate these problems. it is found optimum solutions for all problems in the benchmark suite and it is introduced feasible solutions for the first time. according to the statistical analysis results, among the seventy-seven competing algorithms, the best ten algorithms showed competitive performance in the optimization of tps are lshade-epsin, lshade-cnepsin, shade, lshade, gsk, fdb-agde, mpa, lrfdb-coa and bes. according to the results of the stability analysis carried out on feasible solutions, it has been determined the algorithms with the best success rate for planar type; lshade, lshade-cnepsin, lshade-epsin and gsk with 100% success rate, lshade-cnepsin, lshade-epsin, lshade and shade for space type with 100% success rate, and lshade-epsin with 69% success rate for frequency constrained type. when the performances of the algorithms are evaluated regardless of the problem type, lshade-epsin has been the most stable algorithm with an overall success rate of 90% on the tps. click here for the simulation environment containing the source codes of the ten competitive algorithms and the tp benchmark suite proposed in the article: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/ fileexchange/131668-structural-truss-problems-benchmark-suite. & copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0534
"this study addresses multi-view terrestrial laser scanning point cloud data registration methods. multiple rigid point cloud data registration is mandatory for aligning all scans into a common reference frame and it is still considered a challenge looking from a large-scale surveys point of view. the goal of this work is to support the development of cutting-edge registration methods in geoscience and mobile robotics domains. this work evaluates 3 data sets of total 20 scenes available in the literature. this paper provides a novel open -source framework for multi-view terrestrial laser scanning point cloud data registration benchmarks. the goal was to verify experimentally which registration variant can improve the open-source data looking from the quantitative and qualitative points of view. in particular, the following scanners provided measurement data: z+f tls imager 5006i, z+f tls imager 5010c, leica scanstation c5, leica scanstation c10, leica p40 and riegl vz-400. the benchmark shows an impact of the metric e.g. point to point, point to projection onto a plane, plane to plane etc..., rotation matrix parameterization (tait-bryan, quaternion, rodrigues) and other implementation variations (e.g. multi-view normal distributions transform, pose graph slam approach) onto the multi-view data registration accuracy and performance. an open-source project is created and it can be used for improving existing data sets reported in the literature, it is the added value of the presented research. the combination of metrics, rotation matrix parameterization and optimization algorithms creates hundreds of possible approaches. it is shown that chosen metric is a dominant factor in data registration. the rotation parameterization and other degrees of freedom of proposed variants are rather negligible compared with chosen metric. most of the proposed approaches improve registered reference data provided by other researchers. only for 2 from 20 scenes it was not possible to provide significant improvement. the largest improvements are evident for large-scale scenes. the project is available and maintained at https://github.com/mapshd/hdmapping.",AB_0534
"background: a central lymphadenectomy in right-sided colon cancer involves dissection along the superior mesenteric axis, but the extent is debated due to a lack of consensus and the fear of major complications. this randomized controlled trial compared the rate of postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing laparoscopic versus open right-sided colectomy with central lymphadenectomy. methods: this open, prospective, randomized controlled trial compared patients operated on with open and laparoscopic right-sided colectomy (cstages i-iii) with a central lymphadenectomy at two norwegian institutions between october 2016 and december 2021. dissections were conducted along the superior mesenteric vein in the laparoscopic group, and along the left anterior border of the superior mesenteric artery in the open group, both according to complete mesocolic excision principles. surgery was standardized and performed by three experienced surgeons for each study group. the primary outcome of interest was to measure postoperative 30-day complications (clavien-dindo >= grade ii). results: of 273 eligible patients, 135 were randomized and 128 analysed (63 operated on with open and 65 using laparoscopic procedures). postoperative complications occurred in 42.8 per cent of the patients treated with open and 38.4 per cent of the patients treated using laparoscopic surgery, p = 0.372. the incidence of clavien-dindo grade iiib complications was 7.9 per cent in the open versus 4.6 per cent in the laparoscopic group, p = 0.341. there were no grade iv or v complications, and no re-operations due to anastomotic leakages. there was no significant difference in the mean(s.e.m.) number of removed lymph nodes (open versus laparoscopic respectively: 31.9(1.8) versus 29.3(1.3); p = 0.235). conclusion: there was no significant difference in complications between the two groups. standardized oncologic right-sided colectomy with central lymphadenectomy along the mesenterial root was performed safely, both open and laparoscopic, with incidence of major complications ranging between 4.6 and 7.9 per cent and no re-operations for anastomotic leakage. radicality in terms of lymphadenectomy was comparable between the two groups. registration number: nct03776591 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).",AB_0534
"with the considerable achievements of data-hungry deep learning methods in natural language processing tasks, a great amount of effort has been devoted to develop more diverse datasets for different languages. in this paper, we present farstail, a new dataset for natural language inference task in persian language. it includes 10,367 samples which are generated from 3539 multiple-choice questions. a carefully designed multi-step process is adopted to ensure the quality of the dataset. to provide a solid baseline for future research, we also present the results of traditional and state-of-the-art methods on farstail, including different embedding methods such as word2vec, fasttext, elmo, bert, and laser, as well as different modeling approaches such as decompatt, esim, hbmp, and ulmfit. the best obtained test accuracy is 83.38%, which shows that there is a big room for improving the current methods to be useful for real-world nlp applications in different languages. we also investigate the extent to which the models exploit dataset biases in farstail, and partition the test set into easy and hard subsets according to the success of biased models. the dataset is available at https://github.com/dml-qom/farstail.",AB_0534
"background: in many applications of bioinformatics, data stem from distinct heterogeneous sources. one of the well-known examples is the identification of drugtarget interactions (dtis), which is of significant importance in drug discovery. in this paper, we propose a novel framework, manifold optimization based kernel preserving embedding (mokpe), to efficiently solve the problem of modeling heterogeneous data. our model projects heterogeneous drug and target data into a unified embedding space by preserving drug-target interactions and drug-drug, target-target similarities simultaneously. results: we performed ten replications of ten-fold cross validation on four different drug-target interaction network data sets for predicting dtis for previously unseen drugs. the classification evaluation metrics showed better or comparable performance compared to previous similarity-based state-of-the-art methods. we also evaluated mokpe on predicting unknown dtis of a given network. our implementation of the proposed algorithm in r together with the scripts that replicate the reported experiments is publicly available at https://github.com/ocbinatli/mokpe.",AB_0534
"background the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has been shown to affect nutritional recommendations. some functional foods have been demonstrated to be useful in the treatment of people with covid-19. however, little is known about the impact of combining functional foods on disease control. this study aimed to investigate the effects of functional foods mixture on serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and biochemical findings in patients with covid-19. methods a randomized double-blind controlled trial was conducted in baqiyatallah al-azam hospital in tehran, iran. sixty patients were randomly assigned to receive either a soup containing functional foods (n = 30) or a usual soup (control group) (n = 30). participants' sociodemographic information was gathered using a general questionnaire. blood levels of inflammatory markers and biochemical findings were assessed using standard protocols. results the results showed that soup containing functional foods was more effective in controlling serum levels of d-dimer, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine than the control group (p < 0.05). also, more significant improvement was found in the intervention group vs control group in terms of interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-6, il-17, il-10, and tumor necrose factor-a (p < 0.05). in contrast, the control intervention more efficiently controlled potassium levels and reduced quantitative c-reactive protein than the intervention group (p < 0.05). conclusions this study indicates a soup containing functional foods could alleviate biomarkers of inflammation in patients with covid-19. however, its effectiveness on biochemical findings remained inconclusive which warranted further research. trial registration irct, irct20180201038585n11. registered 23 august 2021, https://www.irct.ir/trial/57338",AB_0534
"background: omentoplasty is a commonly performed procedure after abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer, but its effectiveness to reduce pelviperineal complications is not firmly established. objective: this study aimed to assess the impact of omentoplasty on postoperative outcomes after long-course (chemo) radiotherapy and abdominoperineal resection in patients with locally advanced and locally recurrent rectal cancer. design: retrospective cohort study. settings: single center. patients: all patients with locally advanced and locally recurrent rectal cancer undergoing abdominoperineal resection after neoadjuvant (chemo)radiation in a tertiary referral center between 2008 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. main outcome measures: multivariable logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to analyze the association between omentoplasty and pelviperineal complications, duration of nasogastric tube drainage, and length of hospital stay. results: a total of 305 patients were analyzed, of whom 245 underwent omentoplasty (80%). pelviperineal complications occurred in 151 patients ( 50%) overall, in 125 patients (51%) with omentoplasty, and in 26 patients (43%) without omentoplasty. independent predictors of pelviperineal complications in multivariable analyses were smoking (or 2.68; 95% ci, 1.46- 4.94) and high bmi (or 1.68; 95% ci, 1.00-2.83), but not omentoplasty (or 1.36; 95% ci, 0.77-2.40). the mean duration of nasogastric tube drainage was longer after omentoplasty (6 vs 4 d) with a significant association in multivariable analysis (ss coefficient 1.97; 95% ci, 0.35-3.59). patients undergoing omentoplasty had a significantly longer hospital stay (14 vs 10 d), and omentoplasty remained associated with a prolonged hospital stay after adjusting for confounding ( ss coefficient 3.05; 95% ci, 0.05-5.74). limitations: retrospective design. conclusion: omentoplasty was not associated with a reduced risk of the occurrence of short-term pelviperineal complications after abdominoperineal resection in patients undergoing long-course (chemo) radiotherapy. furthermore, in patients undergoing omentoplasty, prolonged duration of nasogastric tube drainage and hospital stay was observed. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c124.",AB_0534
"the high temporal resolution and the asymmetric spatial activations are essential attributes of electroencephalogram (eeg) underlying emotional processes in the brain. to learn the temporal dynamics and spatial asymmetry of eeg towards accurate and generalized emotion recognition, we propose tsception, a multi-scale convolutional neural network that can classify emotions from eeg. tsception consists of dynamic temporal, asymmetric spatial, and high-level fusion layers, which learn discriminative representations in the time and channel dimensions simultaneously. the dynamic temporal layer consists of multi-scale 1d convolutional kernels whose lengths are related to the sampling rate of eeg, which learns the dynamic temporal and frequency representations of eeg. the asymmetric spatial layer takes advantage of the asymmetric eeg patterns for emotion, learning the discriminative global and hemisphere representations. the learned spatial representations will be fused by a high-level fusion layer. using more generalized cross-validation settings, the proposed method is evaluated on two publicly available datasets deap and mahnob-hci. the performance of the proposed network is compared with prior reported methods such as svm, knn, fbfgmdm, fbtsc, unsupervised learning, deepconvnet, shallowconvnet, and eegnet. tsception achieves higher classification accuracies and f1 scores than other methods in most of the experiments. the codes are available at:https://github.com/yi-ding-cs/tsception",AB_0534
"expansins, which are plant cell wall loosening proteins associated with cell growth, have been identified as a multigene family. plant expansin proteins are an important family that functions in cell growth and many of developmental processes including wall relaxation, fruit softening, abscission, seed germination, mycorrhiza and root nodule formation, biotic and abiotic stress resistance, invasion of pollen tube stigma and organogenesis. in addition, it is thought that increasing the efficiency of plant expansin genes in plants plays a significant role, especially in the production of secondary bioethanol. when the studies on the expansin genes are examined, it is seen that the expansin genes are a significant gene family in the cell wall expansion mechanism. therefore, understanding the efficacy of expansin genes is of great importance. considering the importance of this multigene family, we aimed to create a comprehensively informed database of plant expansin proteins and their properties. the expansin gene family database provides comprehensive online data for the expansin gene family members in the plants. we have designed a new website accessible to the public, including expansin gene family members in 70 plants and their features including gene, coding and peptide sequences, chromosomal location, amino acid length, molecular weight, stability, conserved motif and domain structure and predicted three-dimensional architecture. furthermore, a deep learning system was developed to detect unknown genes belonging to the expansin gene family. in addition, we provided the blast process within the website by establishing a connection to the ncbi blast site in the tools section. thus, the expansin gene family database becomes a useful database for researchers that enables access to all datasets simultaneously with its user-friendly interface. our server can be reached freely at the following link (http://www.expansingenefamily.com/).",AB_0534
