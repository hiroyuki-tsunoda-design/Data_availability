"intrinsic disorder in proteins is relatively abundant in nature and essential for a broad spectrum of cellu-lar functions. while disorder can be accurately pre-dicted from protein sequences, as it was empiri-cally demonstrated in recent community-organized assessments, it is rather challenging to collect and compile a comprehensive prediction that covers multiple disorder functions. to this end, we intro-duce the depicter2 (disordered prediction cen-ter) webserver that offers convenient access to a curated collection of fast and accurate disorder and disorder function predictors. this server includes a state-of-the-art disorder predictor, fldpnn, and five modern methods that cover all currently predictable disorder functions: disordered linkers and protein, peptide, dna, rna and lipid binding. depicter2 al-lows selection of any combination of the six meth-ods, batch predictions of up to 25 proteins per re-quest and provides interactive visualization of the re-sulting predictions. the webserver is freely available at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/depicter2/",AB_0466
"proksee (https://proksee.ca) provides users with a powerful, easy-to-use, and feature-rich system for assembling, annotating, analysing, and visualizing bacterial genomes. proksee accepts illumina sequence reads as compressed fastq files or pre assembled contigs in raw, fasta, or genbank format. alternatively, users can supply a genbank accession or a previously generated proksee map in json format. proksee then performs assembly (for raw sequence data), generates a graphical map, and provides an interface for customizing the map and launching further analysis jobs. notable features of proksee include unique and informative assembly metrics provided via a custom reference database of assemblies; a deeply integrated high-performance genome browser for viewing and comparing analysis results at individual base resolution (developed specifically for proksee); an ever-growing list of embedded analysis tools whose results can be seamlessly added to the map or searched and explored in other formats; and the option to export graphical maps, analysis results, and log files for data sharing and research reproducibility. all these features are provided via a carefully designed multi-server cloud based system that can easily scale to meet user demand and that ensures the web server is robust and responsive.",AB_0466
"despite the undeniable progress in visual recognition tasks fueled by deep neural networks, there exists recent evidence showing that these models are poorly calibrated, resulting in over-confident predictions. the standard practices of minimizing the cross-entropy loss during training promote the predicted softmax probabilities to match the one-hot label assignments. nevertheless, this yields a pre-softmax activation of the correct class that is significantly larger than the remaining activations, which exacerbates the miscalibration problem. recent observations from the classification literature suggest that loss functions that embed implicit or explicit maximization of the entropy of predictions yield state-of-the-art calibration performances. despite these findings, the impact of these losses in the relevant task of calibrating medical image segmentation networks remains unexplored. in this work, we provide a unifying constrained-optimization perspective of current state-of-the-art calibration losses. specifically, these losses could be viewed as approximations of a linear penalty (or a lagrangian term) imposing equality constraints on logit distances. this points to an important limitation of such underlying equality constraints, whose ensuing gradients constantly push towards a non-informative solution, which might prevent from reaching the best compromise between the discriminative performance and calibration of the model during gradient-based optimization. following our observations, we propose a simple and flexible generalization based on inequality constraints, which imposes a controllable margin on logit distances. comprehensive experiments on a variety of public medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method sets novel state-of-the-art results on these tasks in terms of network calibration, whereas the discriminative performance is also improved. the code is available at https://github.com/bala93/marginloss",AB_0466
"background cryolipolysis is a non-invasive and efficacious procedure for body contouring. the effectiveness of cryolipolysis has been demonstrated on multiple areas of the body, but on a limited number of subjects. the aim of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness and the safety of cryolipolysis in the lower abdomen adipose tissue thickness reduction. methods a prospective study on 60 healthy women was carried out using cryoslim hybrid device. each patient underwent two cryolipolysis sessions centered on the abdominal area. the primary endpoint was to decrease the thickness of the abdominal fat deposits. the change in the abdominal circumference and the thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer were assessed. patient satisfaction and tolerance of the procedure were also taken into account. results a significant reduction of the abdominal circumference and subcutaneous fat layer thickness was observed. the mean decrease in abdominal circumference was 2.10 cm (3.1%) 3 months after the procedure and 4.03 cm (5.8%) 6 months after the procedure. the mean decrease in fat layer thickness was 1.25 cm (43.81%) 3 months after the procedure and 1.61 cm (41.73%) 6 months after the procedure. no major adverse events were noted. all patients were very satisfied, and minimal pain was reported. conclusions cryolipolysis is an effective technique to treat abdominal localized fat deposits. no major adverse events have been described for this procedure. our promising results should encourage further studies aimed at optimizing the efficacy of the procedure without a considerable increase in the risks. level of evidence iv this journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article. for a full description of these evidence-based medicine ratings, please refer to the table of contents or the online instructions to authors http://www.springer.com/00266.",AB_0466
"the recent pandemic, war, and oil crises have caused many to reconsider their need to travel for education, training, and meetings. providing assistance and training remotely has thus gained importance for many applications, from industrial maintenance to surgical telemonitoring. current solutions such as video conferencing platforms lack essential communication cues such as spatial referencing, which negatively impacts both time completion and task performance. mixed reality (mr) offers opportunities to improve remote assistance and training, as it opens the way to increased spatial clarity and large interaction space. we contribute a survey of remote assistance and training in mr environments through a systematic literature review to provide a deeper understanding of current approaches, benefits and challenges. we analyze 62 articles and contextualize our findings along a taxonomy based on degree of collaboration, perspective sharing, mr space symmetry, time, input and output modality, visual display, and application domain. we identify the main gaps and opportunities in this research area, such as exploring collaboration scenarios beyond one-expert-to-one-trainee, enabling users to move across the reality-virtuality spectrum during a task, or exploring advanced interaction techniques that resort to hand or eye tracking. our survey informs and helps researchers in different domains, including maintenance, medicine, engineering, or education, build and evaluate novel mr approaches to remote training and assistance. all supplemental materials are available at https://augmented-perception.org/publications/2023-training-survey.html.",AB_0466
"single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) is a revolutionary methodology that helps to analyze transcriptome or genome information from a single cell. however, high dimensionality and sparsity in data due to dropout events pose computational challenges for existing state-of-the-art scrna-seq clustering methods. learning efficient representations becomes even more challenging due to the presence of noise in scrna-seq data. to overcome the effect of noise and learn effective representations, this paper proposes sc-indc (single-cell information maximized noise-invariant deep clustering), a deep neural network that facilitates learning of informative and noise-invariant representations of scrna-seq data. furthermore, the time complexity of the proposed sc-indc is significantly lower compared to state-of-the-art scrna-seq clustering methods. extensive experimentation on fourteen publicly available scrna-seq datasets illustrates the efficacy of the proposed model. additionally, visualizations of t-sne plots and several ablation studies are also conducted to provide insights into the improved representation ability of sc-indc. code of the proposed sc-indc will be available at: https://github.com/arnabkmondal/sc-indc.",AB_0466
"introduction alcohol use disorder (aud) ranks among the most prevalent psychiatric disorders worldwide. despite current treatments, more than half of patients relapse within weeks after treatment. in animal models, exposure to environmental enrichment (ee) has been shown to be a promising approach to reduce relapse. however, controlled, multimodal ee is difficult to transpose to humans. to address this gap, this study aims at assessing the effectiveness of exposure to a newly designed ee protocol during aud treatment in reducing relapse to alcohol use. our ee will allow an enhancement of the standard intervention, and will combine several promising enrichment factors identified in the literature-physical activity, cognitive stimulation, mindfulness and virtual reality (vr). methods and analysis a randomised controlled trial involving 135 participants receiving treatment for severe aud will be conducted. patients will be randomised to an intervention enhancement group or a control group. the enhanced intervention will consist of six 40-min sessions of ee spread over 9 days. during the first 20 min of these sessions, patients will practise mindfulness in multisensory vr, in virtual environments designed to practise mindfulness and use it to regulate craving induced by virtual cues or stress. then, participants will practise indoor cycling combined with cognitive training exercises. the control group will undergo standard management for aud. the primary outcome is relapse assessed at 2 weeks after treatment, using a questionnaire and biological indicators. relapse will be defined as drinking at least five drinks per occasion or drinking at least five times a week. it is predicted that the group receiving the ee intervention will have a lower relapse rate than the control group. the secondary outcomes are relapse at 1 month and 3 months after treatment, craving and drug-seeking behaviour, mindfulness skills acquisition and the effect of the intervention enhancement on the perceived richness of the daily environment, assessed by questionnaires and neuropsychological tasks. ethics and dissemination all participants have to give written informed consent to the investigator. this study is approved by the ethics committee nord ouest iv of lille (reference number 2022-a01156-37). results will be disseminated through presentations, peer-reviewed journals and seminar conferences. all information on ethical considerations and open science practices can be accessed at https://osf.io/b57uj/",AB_0466
"objective the role of endovascular treatment in the management of patients with brain arteriovenous malforma-tions (avms) remains uncertain. avm embolization can be offered as stand-alone curative therapy or prior to surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (srs) (pre-embolization). the treatment of brain avms study (tobas) is an all-inclusive pragmatic study that comprises two randomized trials and multiple registries.methods results from the tobas curative and pre-embolization registries are reported. the primary outcome for this report is death or dependency (modified rankin scale [mrs] score > 2) at last follow-up. secondary outcomes include angiographic results, perioperative serious adverse events (saes), and permanent treatment-related complica-tions leading to an mrs score > 2.results from june 2014 to may 2021, 1010 patients were recruited in tobas. embolization was chosen as the primary curative treatment for 116 patients and pre-embolization prior to surgery or srs for 92 patients. clinical and angiographic outcomes were available in 106 (91%) of 116 and 77 (84%) of 92 patients, respectively. in the curative embolization registry, 70% of avms were ruptured, and 62% were low-grade avms (spetzler-martin grade i or ii), while the pre-embolization registry had 70% ruptured avms and 58% low-grade avms. the primary outcome of death or dis-ability (mrs score > 2) occurred in 15 (14%, 95% ci 8%-22%) of the 106 patients in the curative embolization registry (4 [12%, 95% ci 5%-28%] of 32 unruptured avms and 11 [15%, 95% ci 8%-25%] of 74 ruptured avms) and 9 (12%, 95% ci 6%-21%) of the 77 patients in the pre-embolization registry (4 [17%, 95% ci 7%-37%] of 23 unruptured avms and 5 [9%, 95% ci 4%-20%] of 54 ruptured avms) at 2 years. embolization alone was confirmed to occlude the avm in 32 (30%, 95% ci 21%-40%) of the 106 curative attempts and in 9 (12%, 95% ci 6%-21%) of 77 patients in the pre-embo-lization registry. saes occurred in 28 of the 106 attempted curative patients (26%, 95% ci 18%-35%, including 21 new symptomatic hemorrhages [20%, 95% ci 13%-29%]). five of the new hemorrhages were in previously unruptured avms (n = 32; 16%, 95% ci 5%-33%). of the 77 pre-embolization patients, 18 had saes (23%, 95% ci 15%-34%), including 12 new symptomatic hemorrhages [16%, 95% ci 9%-26%]). three of the hemorrhages were in previously unruptured avms (3/23; 13%, 95% ci 3%-34%).conclusions embolization as a curative treatment for brain avms was often incomplete. hemorrhagic complications were frequent, even when the specified intent was pre-embolization before surgery or srs. because the role of endo- vascular treatment remains uncertain, it should preferably, when possible, be offered in the context of a randomized trial.clinical trial registration no.: nct02098252 (clinicaltrials.gov) https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.9.jns22987",AB_0466
"we give an effective solution to the regularized optimization problem g(x) + h(x), where x is constrained on the unit sphere parallel to x parallel to(2) = 1. here g(center dot) is a smooth cost with lipschitz continuous gradient within the unit ball {x : parallel to x parallel to(2) <= 1} whereas h(center dot) is typically non-smooth but convex and absolutely homogeneous, e.g., normregularizers and their combinations. our solution is based on the riemannian proximal gradient, using an idea we call proxy step-size - a scalar variable which we prove is monotone with respect to the actual step-size within an interval. the proxy step-size exists ubiquitously for convex and absolutely homogeneous h(center dot), and decides the actual step-size and the tangent update in closed-form, thus the complete proximal gradient iteration. based on these insights, we design a riemannian proximal gradient method using the proxy step-size. we prove that our method converges to a critical point, guided by a line-search technique based on the g(center dot) cost only. the proposed method can be implemented in a couple of lines of code. we show its usefulness by applying nuclear norm, l(1) norm, and nuclear-spectral normregularization to three classical computer vision problems. the improvements are consistent and backed by numerical experiments. available at https://bitbucket.org/fangbai/proxystepsize-pgs.",AB_0466
"solving the hamilton-jacobi-bellman equation is important in many domains including control, robotics and economics. especially for continuous control, solving this differential equation and its extension the hamilton-jacobi-isaacs equation, is important as it yields the optimal policy that achieves the maximum reward on a give task. in the case of the hamilton-jacobi-isaacs equation, which includes an adversary controlling the environment and minimizing the reward, the obtained policy is also robust to perturbations of the dynamics. in this paper we propose continuous fitted value iteration (cfvi) and robust fitted value iteration (rfvi). these algorithms leverage the non-linear control-affine dynamics and separable state and action reward of many continuous control problems to derive the optimal policy and optimal adversary in closed form. this analytic expression simplifies the differential equations and enables us to solve for the optimal value function using value iteration for continuous actions and states as well as the adversarial case. notably, the resulting algorithms do not require discretization of states or actions. we apply the resulting algorithms to the furuta pendulum and cartpole. we show that both algorithms obtain the optimal policy. the robustness sim2real experiments on the physical systems show that the policies successfully achieve the task in the real-world. when changing the masses of the pendulum, we observe that robust value iteration is more robust compared to deep reinforcement learning algorithm and the non-robust version of the algorithm. videos of the experiments are shown at https://sites.google.com/view/rfvi.",AB_0466
