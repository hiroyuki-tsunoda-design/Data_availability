"motivation backsplicing of rna results in circularized rather than linear transcripts, known as circular rna (circrna). a recently discovered and poorly understood subset of circrnas that are composed of multiple genes, termed fusion-derived circular rnas (fcircrnas), represent a class of potential biomarkers shown to have oncogenic potential. detection of fcircrnas eludes existing analytical tools, making it difficult to more comprehensively assess their prevalence and function. improved detection methods may lead to additional biological and clinical insights related to fcircrnas.results we developed the first unbiased tool for detecting fcircrnas (integrate-circ) and visualizing fcircrnas (integrate-vis) from rna-seq data. we found that integrate-circ was more sensitive, precise and accurate than other tools based on our analysis of simulated rna-seq data and our tool was able to outperform other tools in an analysis of public lymphoblast cell line data. finally, we were able to validate in vitro three novel fcircrnas detected by integrate-circ in a well-characterized breast cancer cell line.availability and implementation open source code for integrate-circ and integrate-vis is available at https://www.github.com/chrismaherlab/integrate-circ and https://www.github.com/chrismaherlab/integrate-vis.",AB_0602
"motivation in recent years, significant strides have been made in the field of genomics, with the commencement of large-scale studies aimed at collecting host mutational profiles and microbiome data. the amalgamation of host gene mutational profiles in both healthy and diseased subjects with microbial abundance data holds immense promise in providing insights into several crucial research questions, including the development and progression of diseases, as well as individual responses to therapeutic interventions. with the advent of sequencing methods such as 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) sequencing and whole genome sequencing, there is increasing evidence of interplay of human genetics and microbial communities. quantitative trait loci associated with microbial abundance (mbqtls), are genetic variants that influence the abundance of microbial populations within the host.results here, we introduce mbqtl, the first r package integrating 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) sequencing and single-nucleotide variation (snv) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) data. we describe various statistical methods implemented for the identification of microbe-snv pairs, relevant statistical measures, and plot functionality for interpretation.availability and implementation mbqtl is available on bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/mbqtl/.",AB_0602
"as mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (m-teer) is evolving as an effective treatment for high-risk surgical patients with mitral regurgitation, there is a pressing need for cardiologists to optimize resources through risk stratification of in-hospital mortality for this patient population. although current risk-prediction models have been shown to predict adverse outcomes with reasonable accuracy, models trained using the us nationwide population are lacking. this study aimed to identify clinical, demographic, and procedural features that predict in-hospital mortality, and to derive and validate an in-hospital mortality risk-prediction tool in patients who have undergone m-teer. a total of 9,373 admissions from the nationwide readmissions database of patients who underwent m-teer between 2015 and 2018 were used to develop and validate the model. we first performed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regularization of cox regression (coxnet) that is 10-fold cross-validated. the non-zero coefficients were multiplied with the respective values of each observation of the predictors to build the scoring formula. out of 9,373 admissions, 196 patients (2%) died in-hospital during index admission. in descending order, the top variables that were most predictive of in-hospital mortality were higher age, presence of fluid and electrolyte disturbance, and large metropolitan location of the hospital. the validation c-statistic of the mitracox score was 0.82. using x-tile software (yale school of medicine, new haven, connecticut), 2 cutoffs of the score were determined on the basis of in-hospital mortality and length of stay, and the survival of the population was classified into 3 risk groups: low, intermediate, and high. the scoring system deployed online as a web-based calculator can be accessed at https://kathavs.shinyapps.io/mitracox_kapadia/. in conclusion, mitracox score is easy to calculate and predicts in-hospital mortality depending on length of stay in a dynamic manner.

"background: bisulfite sequencing is a powerful tool for profiling genomic methylation, an epigenetic modification critical in the understanding of cancer, psychiatric disorders, and many other conditions. raw data generated by whole genome bisulfite sequencing (wgbs) requires several computational steps before it is ready for statistical analysis, and particular care is required to process data in a timely and memory-efficient manner. alignment to a reference genome is one of the most computationally demanding steps in a wgbs workflow, taking several hours or even days with commonly used wgbs-specific alignment software. this naturally motivates the creation of computational workflows that can utilize gpu-based alignment software to greatly speed up the bottleneck step. in addition, wgbs produces raw data that is large and often unwieldy; a lack of memory-efficient representation of data by existing pipelines renders wgbs impractical or impossible to many researchers. results: we present biocmap, a bioconductor-friendly methylation analysis pipeline consisting of two modules, to address the above concerns. the first module performs computationally-intensive read alignment using arioc, a gpu-accelerated short-read aligner. since gpus are not always available on the same computing environments where traditional cpu-based analyses are convenient, the second module may be run in a gpu-free environment. this module extracts and merges dna methylation proportions-the fractions of methylated cytosines across all cells in a sample at a given genomic site. bioconductor-based output objects in r utilize an on- disk data representation to drastically reduce required main memory and make wgbs projects computationally feasible to more researchers. conclusions: biocmap is implemented using nextflow and available at http://resea rch.libd.org/biocmap/. to enable reproducible analysis across a variety of typical computing environments, biocmap can be containerized with docker or singularity, and executed locally or with the slurm or sge scheduling engines. by providing bio-conductor objects, biocmap's output can be integrated with powerful analytical open source software for analyzing methylation data.",AB_0602
"motivation the application of machine learning approaches in phylogenetics has been impeded by the vast model space associated with inference. supervised machine learning approaches require data from across this space to train models. because of this, previous approaches have typically been limited to inferring relationships among unrooted quartets of taxa, where there are only three possible topologies. here, we explore the potential of generative adversarial networks (gans) to address this limitation. gans consist of a generator and a discriminator: at each step, the generator aims to create data that is similar to real data, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish generated and real data. by using an evolutionary model as the generator, we use gans to make evolutionary inferences. since a new model can be considered at each iteration, heuristic searches of complex model spaces are possible. thus, gans offer a potential solution to the challenges of applying machine learning in phylogenetics.results we developed phylogan, a gan that infers phylogenetic relationships among species. phylogan takes as input a concatenated alignment, or a set of gene alignments, and infers a phylogenetic tree either considering or ignoring gene tree heterogeneity. we explored the performance of phylogan for up to 15 taxa in the concatenation case and 6 taxa when considering gene tree heterogeneity. error rates are relatively low in these simple cases. however, run times are slow and performance metrics suggest issues during training. future work should explore novel architectures that may result in more stable and efficient gans for phylogenetics.availability and implementation phylogan is available on github: https://github.com/meganlsmith/phylogan/.",AB_0602
"motivation identifying and tracking recombinant strains of sars-cov-2 is critical to understanding the evolution of the virus and controlling its spread. but confidently identifying sars-cov-2 recombinants from thousands of new genome sequences that are being shared online every day is quite challenging, causing many recombinants to be missed or suffer from weeks of delay in being formally identified while undergoing expert curation.results we present rivet-a software pipeline and visual platform that takes advantage of recent algorithmic advances in recombination inference to comprehensively and sensitively search for potential sars-cov-2 recombinants and organize the relevant information in a web interface that would help greatly accelerate the process of identifying and tracking recombinants.availability and implementation rivet-based web interface displaying the most updated analysis of potential sars-cov-2 recombinants is available at https://rivet.ucsd.edu/. rivet's frontend and backend code is freely available under the mit license at https://github.com/turakhialab/rivet and the documentation for rivet is available at https://turakhialab.github.io/rivet/. the inputs necessary for running rivet's backend workflow for sars-cov-2 are available through a public database maintained and updated daily by ucsc (https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/wuhcor1/usher_sars-cov-2/).",AB_0602
"inaccurate optical flow estimates in and near occluded regions, and out-of-boundary regions are two of the current significant limitations of optical flow estimation algorithms. recent state-of-the-art optical flow estimation algorithms are two-frame based methods where optical flow is estimated sequentially for each consecutive image pair in a sequence. while this approach gives good flow estimates, it fails to generalize optical flows in occluded regions mainly due to limited local evidence regarding moving elements in a scene. in this work, we propose a learning-based multi-frame optical flow estimation method that estimates two or more consecutive optical flows in parallel from multi-frame image sequences. our underlying hypothesis is that by understanding temporal scene dynamics from longer sequences with more than two frames, we can characterize pixel-wise dependencies in a larger spatiotemporal domain, generalize complex motion patterns and thereby improve the accuracy of optical flow estimates in occluded regions. we present learning -based spatiotemporal recurrent transformers for multi-frame based optical flow estimation (sstms). our method utilizes 3d convolutional gated recurrent units (3d-convgrus) and spatiotemporal transformers to learn recurrent space-time motion dynamics and global dependencies in the scene and provide a generalized optical flow estimation. when compared with recent state-of-the-art two-frame and multi-frame methods on real world and synthetic datasets, performance of the sstms were significantly higher in occluded and out-of-boundary regions. among all published state-of-the-art multi-frame methods, sstm achieved state-of the-art results on the sintel final and kitti2015 benchmark datasets. software code, data and instructions: https://github.com/computational-ocularscience/sstm.",AB_0602
"motivation molecular-level classification of protein-protein interfaces can greatly assist in functional characterization and rational drug design. the most accurate protein interface predictions rely on finding homologous proteins with known interfaces since most interfaces are conserved within the same protein family. the accuracy of these template-based prediction approaches depends on the correct choice of suitable templates. choosing the right templates in the immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf) is challenging because its members share low sequence identity and display a wide range of alternative binding sites despite structural homology.results we present a new approach to predict protein interfaces. first, template-specific, informative evolutionary profiles are established using a mutual information-based approach. next, based on the similarity of residue level conservation scores derived from the evolutionary profiles, a query protein is hierarchically clustered with all available template proteins in its superfamily with known interface definitions. once clustered, a subset of the most closely related templates is selected, and an interface prediction is made. these initial interface predictions are subsequently refined by extensive docking. this method was benchmarked on 51 igsf proteins and can predict nontrivial interfaces of igsf proteins with an average and median f-score of 0.64 and 0.78, respectively. we also provide a way to assess the confidence of the results. the average and median f-scores increase to 0.8 and 0.81, respectively, if 27% of low confidence cases and 17% of medium confidence cases are removed. lastly, we provide residue level interface predictions, protein complexes, and confidence measurements for singletons in the igsf.availability and implementation source code is freely available at: https://gitlab.com/fiserlab.org/interdct_with_refinement.",AB_0602
"introductionvaccination is an important measure used to control the spread of covid19. the estimation of risk versus benefit of vaccination is based on the understanding of information about the vaccine. statistics are frequently part of communications about covid19. individuals that do not have an adequate foundation of statistical knowledge may not be able to properly assess associated risks and benefits. this study aims to assess the association between statistical literacy and hesitation to receive the covid19 vaccine.methodsa nationally representative sample of 2,138 adults, recruited through cint united states, inc., (lawrenceville, nj; http://www.cint.com), completed an internet survey in the summer of 2021. this survey collected demographic measures and information about covid19 vaccination status. the competency of respondents on various basic statistical concepts was assessed along with the corresponding confidence of respondents in their answers. a multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to assess the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and statistical literacy while controlling for covariates of interest.resultsstatistical literacy was found to have a negligible association with covid19 vaccine hesitancy (or 1.01; 95% ci 1.00-1.02). in addition, differences in the proportion receiving the covid19 vaccine between political affiliations, income levels, race groups, and ethnicities were observed.discussionthe statistical knowledge of the general american public is not commensurate with the need to be literate in basic statistical concepts in the data-driven world in which we live. an effective way to stem vaccine hesitancy may rely on increased statistical knowledge to not be biased by preconceived beliefs shaped by misinformation.",AB_0602
"background: angiotensin ii receptor blockers (arbs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (aceis) block distinct components of the renin-angiotensin system. whether this translates into differential effects on cardiovascular disease events remains unclear. methods and results: we used the accord-bp (action to control cardiovascular risk in diabetes-blood pressure) trial and the sprint (systolic blood pressure intervention trial) to emulate target trials of new users of arbs versus aceis on cardiovascular disease events (primary outcome) and death (secondary outcome). we estimated marginal cause-specific hazard ratios (hrs) and treatment-specific cumulative incidence functions with inverse probability of treatment weights. we identified 3298 new users of arbs or aceis (accord-bp: 374 arb versus 884 acei; sprint: 727 arb versus 1313 acei). for participants initiating arbs versus aceis, the inverse probability of treatment weight rate of the primary outcome was 3.2 versus 3.5 per 100 person-years in accord-bp (hr, 0.91 [95% ci, 0.63-1.31]) and 1.8 versus 2.2 per 100 person-years in sprint (hr, 0.81 [95% ci, 0.56-1.18]). there were no appreciable differences in pooled analyses, except that arbs versus aceis were associated with a lower death rate (hr, 0.56 [95% ci, 0.37-0.85]). arbs were associated with a lower rate of the primary outcome among subgroups of male versus female participants, non-hispanic black versus non-hispanic white participants, and those randomly assigned to standard versus intensive blood pressure (p interaction: <0.01, 0.05, and <0.01, respectively). conclusions: in this secondary analysis of accord-bp and sprint, new users of arb-versus acei-based antihypertensive medication regimens experienced similar cardiovascular disease events rates, with important subgroup differences and lower rates of death overall. registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifiers: nct01206062, nct00000620.",AB_0602
