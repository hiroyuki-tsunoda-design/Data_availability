"enzymatic digestion of lignocellulosic plant biomass is a key step in bio-refinery approaches for the production of biofuels and other valuable chemicals. however, the recalcitrance of this material in conjunction with its variability and heterogeneity strongly hampers the economic viability and profitability of biofuel production. to complement both academic and industrial experimental research in the field, we designed an advanced web application that encapsulates our in-house developed complex biophysical model of enzymatic plant cell wall degradation. predig (https://predig .cs .hhu .de/) is a user-friendly, free, and fully open-source web application that allows the user to perform in silico experiments. specifically, it uses a gillespie algorithm to run stochastic simulations of the enzymatic saccharification of a lignocellulose microfibril, at the mesoscale, in three dimensions. such simulations can for instance be used to test the action of distinct enzyme cocktails on the substrate. additionally, predig can fit the model parameters to uploaded experimental time-course data, thereby returning values that are intrinsically difficult to measure experimentally. this gives the user the possibility to learn which factors quantitatively explain the recalcitrance to saccharification of their specific biomass material.",AB_0479
"motion prediction systems play a crucial role in enabling autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in complex traffic scenarios. graph neural network (gnn)-based approaches have emerged as a promising solution for capturing interactions among dynamic agents and static objects. however, they often lack transparency, interpretability and explainability - qualities that are essential for building trust in autonomous driving systems. in this work, we address this challenge by presenting a comprehensive approach to enhance the explainability of graph-based motion prediction systems. we introduce the explainable heterogeneous graph based policy (xhgp) model based on an heterogeneous graph representation of the traffic scene and lane-graph traversals. distinct from other graph-based models, xhgp leverages object level and type-level attention mechanisms to learn interaction behaviors, providing information about the importance of agents and interactions in the scene. in addition, capitalizing on xhgp's architecture, we investigate the explanations provided by the gnnexplainer and apply counterfactual reasoning to analyze the sensitivity of the model to modifications of the input data. this includes masking scene elements, altering trajectories, and adding or removing dynamic agents. our proposal advances towards achieving reliable and explainable motion prediction systems, addressing the concerns of users, developers and regulatory agencies alike. the insights gained from our explainability analysis contribute to a better understanding of the relationships between dynamic and static elements in traffic scenarios, facilitating the interpretation of the results, as well as the correction of possible errors in motion prediction models, and thus contributing to the development of trustworthy motion prediction systems.the code to reproduce this work is publicly available at https://github.com/sancarlim/ explainable-mp/tree/v1.1.",AB_0479
"the molecular causes and mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases remain poorly understood. a growing number of single-cell studies have implicated various neural, glial, and immune cell subtypes to affect the mammalian central nervous system in many age-related disorders. integrating this body of transcriptomic evidence into a comprehensive and reproducible framework poses several computational challenges. here, we introduce zebra, a large single-cell and single-nucleus rna-seq database. zebra integrates and normalizes gene expression and metadata from 33 studies, encompassing 4.2 million human and mouse brain cells sampled from 39 brain regions. it incorporates samples from patients with neurodegenerative diseases like alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, as well as samples from relevant mouse models. we employed scvi, a deep probabilistic auto-encoder model, to integrate the samples and curated both cell and sample metadata for downstream analysis. zebra allows for cell-type and disease-specific markers to be explored and compared between sample conditions and brain regions, a cell composition analysis, and gene-wise feature mappings. our comprehensive molecular database facilitates the generation of data-driven hypotheses, enhancing our understanding of mammalian brain function during aging and disease. the data sets, along with an interactive database are freely available at https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/zebra. graphical abstract",AB_0479
"the identification and characterization of interfaces in protein complexes is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of molecular recognition. these interfaces are also attractive targets for protein inhibition. however, targeting protein interfaces can be challenging for large interfaces that consist of multiple interacting regions. we present pickluster [protein interface c(k)luster]-a program for identifying sub-interfaces in protein-protein complexes using distance clustering. the division of the interface into smaller sub-interfaces offers a more focused approach for targeting protein-protein interfaces. availability and implementation: pickluster is implemented as a plug-in for the molecular visualization program ucsf chimerax 1.4 and subsequent versions. it is freely available for download in the chimerax toolshed and https://gitlab.com/topf-lab/pickluster.git.",AB_0479

"motivation evolutionary inference depends crucially on the quality of multiple sequence alignments (msa), which is problematic for distantly related proteins. since protein structure is more conserved than sequence, it seems natural to use structure alignments for distant homologs. however, structure alignments may not be suitable for inferring evolutionary relationships.results here we examined four protein similarity measures that depend on sequence and structure (fraction of aligned residues, sequence identity, fraction of superimposed residues, and contact overlap), finding that they are intimately correlated but none of them provides a complete and unbiased picture of conservation in proteins. therefore, we propose the new hybrid protein sequence and structure similarity score pc_sim based on their main principal component. the corresponding divergence measure pc_div shows the strongest correlation with divergences obtained from individual similarities, suggesting that it infers accurate evolutionary divergences. we developed the program pc_ali that constructs protein msas either de novo or modifying an input msa, using a similarity matrix based on pc_sim. the program constructs a starting msa based on the maximal cliques of the graph of these pas and it refines it through progressive alignments along the tree reconstructed with pc_div. compared with eight state-of-the-art multiple structure or sequence alignment tools, pc_ali achieves higher or equal aligned fraction and structural scores, sequence identity higher than structure aligners although lower than sequence aligners, highest score pc_sim, and highest similarity with the msas produced by other tools and with the reference msa balibase.availability and implementation https://github.com/ugobas/pc_ali.",AB_0479
"introduction: mental disorders are among the leading causes of ill-health and disability worldwide. despite the disease burden they cause, including significant direct and indirect impacts on individual's health and major social and economic consequences in all countries of the world, it is still one of the most neglected areas of public health. in such a context, the medicinal plants traditionally used to pale these pathologies are presented as a promising tool for future drug development for the management of mental health disorders. the aim of the present study is to analyze the information about plant species used to treat mental disorders in the catalan linguistic area (cla) and compare these traditional uses with pharmacological literature in order to evaluate the most quoted taxa and their uses and to provide a basis for further research. methods: data have been recovered from the etnobotanica dels paisos catalans webpage (https://etnobotanica.iec.cat/) and the meta-analytic work carried out in the present study covers 27 prospections performed in different territories between 1990 and 2019. descriptive statistics and quantitative ethnobotany were carried out and some ethnobotanical indices were calculated. results and discussion: the number of use reports analysed to treat mental disorders in cla is 2,544 spread over 183 taxa belonging to 64 families, being the most cited the malvaceae (29.36% of use reports), lamiaceae (16.71%), caprifoliaceae (7.94%), rutaceae (7.47%) and papaveraceae (6.01%). the most used taxa to treat or alleviate the mental disorders have been tilia platyphyllos scop.

"introduction: alcohol consumption is the main substance abused during university and is associated with physical, legal, emotional, social, and cognitive consequences. the peer-led basics intervention has been shown to be effective in decreasing the quantity and frequency of drinking, the estimated peak blood alcohol concentration (bac), and the number of binge drinking episodes among this population. objective: this study evaluated the effectiveness of the peer-led basics intervention to reduce risky alcohol consumption among university students in the spanish context. materials and methods: a two-arm randomized controlled trial in a university in northern spain including 308 first- and second-year university students recruited between october 2022 to march 2023. the intervention was a 30-min in-person peer-led motivational interview. participants were assessed at baseline and 1-month postintervention. the primary outcome was the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption during a typical week. the intervention effect was verified using a mixed factorial anova model. results: compared with students in the control group, students who received the intervention reduced the number of drinks per week by 5.7 (95% ci 5.54, 5.86); the number of drinks consumed in a typical weekend by 5.2 (95% ci 5.07, 5.33); the number of drinks consumed on the occasion of greatest consumption by 4.9 (95% ci 4.78, 5.02); the number of binge drinking episodes by 1.4 (95% ci 1.37, 1.43); the peak bac on a typical week and on the occasion of greatest consumption decreased by 0.06 (95% ci 0.058, 0.062) and 0.09 (95% ci 0.088, 0.092); the number of alcohol-related consequences by 5.8 (95% ci 5.67, 5.93); and the motivation to change their alcohol use increased by -0.8 (95% ci -0.85, -0.75). conclusion: the peer-led basics intervention is effective in changing alcohol consumption and its related consequences among spanish university students in the short term. the action of nursing students as counselors positively impacted drinking patterns among their peers. clinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/nct05639374?intr=effectiveness%20of%20a%20peer-led%20program%20to%20prevent%20alcohol%20consumption&rank=1&page=1&limit=10, identifier: nct05639374.",AB_0479
"the detection of adaptive selection in a system approach considering all protein-coding genes allows for the identification of mechanisms and pathways that enabled adaptation to different environments. currently, available programs for the estimation of positive selection signals can be divided into two groups. they are either easy to apply but can analyze only one gene family at a time, restricting system analysis; or they can handle larger cohorts of gene families, but require considerable prerequisite data such as orthology associations, codon alignments, phylogenetic trees, and proper configuration files. all these steps require extensive computational expertise, restricting this endeavor to specialists. here, we introduce alexandrusps, a high-throughput pipeline that overcomes technical challenges when conducting transcriptome-wide positive selection analyses on large sets of nucleotide and protein sequences. the pipeline streamlines 1) the execution of an accurate orthology prediction as a precondition for positive selection analysis, 2) preparing and organizing configuration files for codeml, 3) performing positive selection analysis using codeml, and 4) generating an output that is easy to interpret, including all maximum likelihood and log-likelihood test results. the only input needed from the user is the cds and peptide fasta files of proteins of interest. the pipeline is provided in a docker image, requiring no program or module installation, enabling the application of the pipeline in any computing environment. alexandrusps and its documentation are available via github (https://github.com/alejocn5/alexandrusps).",AB_0479
"background: quality control of dna sequences is an important data preprocessing step in many genomic analyses. however, all existing parallel tools for this purpose are based on a batch processing model, needing to have the complete genetic dataset before processing can even begin. this limitation clearly hinders quality control performance in those scenarios where the dataset must be downloaded from a remote repository and/or copied to a distributed file system for its parallel processing. results: in this paper we present sequal-stream, a streaming tool that allows performing multiple quality control operations on genomic datasets in a fast, distributed and scalable way. to do so, our approach relies on the apache spark framework and the hadoop distributed file system (hdfs) to fully exploit the stream paradigm and accelerate the preprocessing of large datasets as they are being downloaded and/or copied to hdfs. the experimental results have shown significant improvements in the execution times of sequal-stream when compared to a batch processing tool with similar quality control features, providing a maximum speedup of 2.7x when processing a dataset with more than 250 million dna sequences, while also demonstrating good scalability features. conclusion: our solution provides a more scalable and higher performance way to carry out quality control of large genomic datasets by taking advantage of stream processing features. the tool is distributed as free open-source software released under the gnu agplv3 license and is publicly available to download at https://github.com/udc-gac/sequal-stream.",AB_0479
