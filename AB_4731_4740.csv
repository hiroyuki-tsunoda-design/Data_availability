"this letter introduces a new sparse unmixing technique using archetypal analysis (sunaa). first, we design a new model based on archetypal analysis (aa). we assume that the endmembers of interest are a convex combination of endmembers provided by a spectral library and that the number of endmembers of interest is known. then, we propose a minimization problem. unlike most conventional sparse unmixing methods, here the minimization problem is nonconvex. we minimize the optimization objective iteratively using an active set algorithm. our method is robust to the initialization and only requires the number of endmembers of interest. sunaa is evaluated using two simulated datasets for which results confirm its better performance over other conventional and advanced techniques in terms of signal-to-reconstruction error (sre). sunaa is also applied to cuprite dataset and the results are compared visually with the available geological map provided for this dataset. the qualitative assessment demonstrates the successful estimation of the minerals abundances and significantly improves the detection of dominant minerals compared to the conventional regression-based sparse unmixing methods. the python implementation of sunaa can be found at: https://github.com/behnoodrasti/sunaa.",AB_0474
"given the proliferation of sensors and actuators, evaluating the network performance of current and forthcoming city-wide internet of things (iot) applications is a challenging task. to overcome this challenge, we created a large-scale simulator called piot over the years that can assess the performance of multiple millions of mobile/static iot devices using a 4g/5g cellular infrastructure. in piot, different key performance indicators (kpis) are defined and collected to produce data to evaluate applications and network performance. piot is an on-going academic simulator project, and its most recent version is accessible to the public through the user interface found on https://www.piotsimulation.com without any installation requirements. it uses a realistic database that contains the real locations and features of base stations (bss) and the real locations of iot user equipment devices. the interface can be used by operators and researchers to understand network behavior when deploying new applications or to gather data to feed artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. the objective of this paper is to present a detailed description of the piot modeling architecture, as well as some use cases to help potential users understand the type of capabilities that are available when using the simulator. limitations and comparisons with other popular engines are also included in the paper.",AB_0474
"background: the accuracy of self-reported vaccination status is important to guide real-world vaccine effectiveness studies and policy making in jurisdictions where access to electronic vaccine registries is restricted.objective: this study aimed to determine the accuracy of self-reported vaccination status and reliability of the self-reported methods: this diagnostic accuracy study was completed by the canadian covid-19 emergency department rapid response network. we enrolled consecutive patients presenting to 4 emergency departments (eds) in quebec between march 24, 2020, and december 25, 2021. we included adult patients who were able to consent, could speak english or french, and had a proven covid-19 infection. we compared the self-reported vaccination status of the patients with their vaccination status in the electronic quebec vaccination registry. our primary outcome was the accuracy of the self-reported vaccination status (index test) ascertained during telephone follow-up compared with the quebec vaccination registry (reference standard). the accuracy was calculated by dividing all correctly self-reported vaccinated and unvaccinated participants by the sum of all correctly and incorrectly self-reported vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. we also reported interrater agreement with the reference standard as measured by unweighted cohen symbolscript for self-reported vaccination status at telephone follow-up and at the time of their index ed visit, number of vaccine doses, and brand.results: during the study period, we included 1361 participants. at the time of the follow-up interview, 932 participants reported at least 1 dose of a covid-19 vaccine. the accuracy of the self-reported vaccination status was 96% (95% ci 95%-97%). cohen symbolscript for self-reported vaccination status at phone follow-up was 0.91 (95% ci 0.89-0.93) and 0.85 (95% ci 0.77-0.92) at the time of their index ed visit. cohen symbolscript was 0.89 (95% ci 0.87-0.91) for the number of doses, 0.80 (95% ci 0.75-0.84) for the brand of the first dose, 0.76 (95% ci 0.70-0.83) for the brand of the second dose, and 0.59 (95% ci 0.34-0.83) for the brand of the third dose.conclusions: we reported a high accuracy of self-reported vaccination status for adult patients without cognitive disorders who can express themselves in english or french. researchers can use self-reported covid-19 vaccination data on the number of doses received, vaccine brand name, and timing of vaccination to guide future research with patients who are capable of self-reporting their vaccination data. however, access to official electronic vaccine registries is still needed to determine the vaccination status in certain susceptible populations where self-reported vaccination data remain missing or impossible to obtain.trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct04702945; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04702945",AB_0474
"background: vaccine safety surveillance is a core component of vaccine pharmacovigilance. in canada, active, participant-centered vaccine surveillance is available for influenza vaccines and has been used for covid-19 vaccines.objective: the objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of using a mobile app for reporting participant-centered seasonal influenza adverse events following immunization (aefis) compared to a web-based notification system.methods: participants were randomized to influenza vaccine safety reporting via a mobile app or a web-based notification platform. all participants were invited to complete a user experience survey.results: among the 2408 randomized participants, 1319 (54%) completed their safety survey 1 week after vaccination, with a higher completion rate among the web-based notification platform users (767/1196, 64%) than among mobile app users (552/1212, 45%; p<.001). ease-of-use ratings were high for the web-based notification platform users (99% strongly agree or agree) and 88.8% of them strongly agreed or agreed that the system made reporting aefis easier. web-based notification platform users supported the statement that a web-based notification-only approach would make it easier for public health professionals to detect vaccine safety signals (91.4%, agreed or strongly agreed).conclusions: participants in this study were significantly more likely to respond to a web-based safety survey rather than within a mobile app. these results suggest that mobile apps present an additional barrier for use compared to the web-based notification-only approach.trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct05794113; https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct05794113",AB_0474
"deep learning (dl) models have been successfully applied in video-based affective computing, allowing, for instance, to recognize emotions and mood, or to estimate the intensity of pain or stress of individuals based on their facial expressions. despite the recent advances with state-of-the-art dl models for spatio-temporal recognition of facial expressions associated with depressive behaviour, some key challenges remain in the cost-effective application of 3d-cnns: (1) 3d convolutions usually employ structures with fixed temporal depth that decreases the potential to extract discriminative representations due to the usually small difference of spatio-temporal variations along different depression levels; and (2) the computational complexity of these models with consequent susceptibility to overfitting. to address these challenges, we propose a novel dl architecture called the maximization and differentiation network (mdn) in order to effectively represent facial expression variations that are relevant for depression assessment. the mdn, operating without 3d convolutions, explores multiscale temporal information using a maximization block that captures smooth facial variations and a difference block that encodes sudden facial variations. extensive experiments using our proposed mdn with models with 100 and 152 layers result in improved performance while reducing the number of parameters by more than $3\times$3x when compared with 3d resnet models. our model also outperforms other 3d models and achieves state-of-the-art results for depression detection. code available at: https://github.com/wheidima/mdn.",AB_0474
"this paper proposes a new glass segmentation method utilizing paired rgb and thermal images. due to the large difference between the transmission property of visible light and that of the thermal energy through the glass where most glass is transparent to the visible light but opaque to thermal energy, glass regions of a scene are made more distinguishable with a pair of rgb and thermal images than solely with an rgb image. to exploit such a unique property, we propose a neural network architecture that effectively combines an rgb-thermal image pair with a new multi-modal fusion module based on attention, and integrate cnn and transformer to extract local features and non-local dependencies, respectively. as well, we have collected a new dataset containing 5551 rgb-thermal image pairs with ground-truth segmentation annotations. the qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on fusing rgb and thermal data for glass segmentation. our code and data are available at https://github.com/dong-huo/rgb-t-glass-segmentation.",AB_0474
"infant pose monitoring during sleep has multiple applications in both healthcare and home settings. in a healthcare setting, pose detection can be used for region-of-interest (roi) detection and movement detection for noncontact-based monitoring systems. in a home setting, pose detection can be used to detect sleep positions, which has shown to have a strong influence on multiple health factors. however, pose monitoring during sleep is challenging due to heavy occlusions from blanket coverings and low lighting. to address this, we present a novel dataset, simultaneously-collected multimodal mannequin lying pose (smal) dataset, for under-the-cover infant pose estimation. we collect depth and pressure imagery of an infant mannequin in different poses under various cover conditions. we successfully infer full body pose under the cover by training state-of-the-art pose estimation methods and leveraging existing multimodal adult pose datasets for transfer learning. we demonstrate a hierarchical pretraining strategy for transformer-based models to significantly improve performance on our dataset. our best-performing model was able to detect joints under the cover within 25 mm 86% of the time with an overall mean error of 16.9 mm. data, code, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/danielkyr/smal.",AB_0474
"speckle filtering is generally a prerequisite to the analysis of synthetic aperture radar (sar) images. tremendous progress has been achieved in the domain of single-image despeckling. latest techniques rely on deep neural networks to restore the various structures and textures peculiar to sar images. the availability of time series of sar images offers the possibility of improving speckle filtering by combining different speckle realizations over the same area. the supervised training of deep neural networks requires ground-truth speckle-free images. such images can only be obtained indirectly through some form of averaging, by spatial or temporal integration, and are imperfect. given the potential of very high-quality restoration reachable by multitemporal speckle filtering, the limitations of ground-truth images need to be circumvented. we extend a recent self-supervised training strategy for single-look complex (slc) sar images, called merlin, to the case of multitemporal filtering. this requires modeling the sources of statistical dependencies in the spatial and temporal dimensions as well as between the real and imaginary components of the complex amplitudes. quantitative analysis on datasets with simulated speckle indicates a clear improvement of speckle reduction when additional sar images are included. our method is then applied to stacks of terrasar-x images and shown to outperform competing multitemporal speckle filtering approaches. the code of the trained models and supplementary results are made freely available at https://gitlab.telecom-paris.fr/ring/multitemporal-merlin/.",AB_0474
"background: surgeons commonly repeat preoperative endoscopy before planned colorectal resections. the reasons for this are not entirely clear, and repeat endoscopy may lead to delays in curative resection, increased costs, and patient discomfort. objective: this study aimed to determine practice patterns, localization techniques, and processes of communication undertaken by endoscopy specialists in a high-volume regional health authority. design: this was a qualitative study involving standardized, semi-structured, in-depth interviews that were conducted in person. data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. settings: the study was conducted at canadian tertiary and community facilities. participants: ten general surgeons and 10 gastroenterologists were included using a convenience sampling technique. main outcome measures: interview questions were developed to understand the perspectives and practice patterns of endoscopists when approaching patients diagnosed with colorectal lesions requiring surgical resection. the decision-making process to perform a repeat preoperative endoscopy was assessed. results: three key themes emerged: 1) patterns of communication, 2) feedback, and 3) trust. thematic analysis revealed that poor communication and ambiguous documentation increased the likelihood of performing repeat preoperative endoscopy. inconsistencies in tattooing practices and lesion location were important factors. negative experiences and factors related to interprofessional trust emerged as key contributors to repeat preoperative endoscopy. limitations: the transferability of findings to health care systems outside canada may be limited and requires further study. conclusions: suboptimal endoscopic reporting contributes to gaps in communication among endoscopists. in addition, lack of consistent feedback and mutual trust may increase the likelihood of performing repeat preoperative lower endoscopy. inconsistent tattooing practices pose significant concerns for accurate intraoperative lesion localization. establishing collaborative work environments through joint educational initiatives may enhance communication and mitigate unnecessary repeat procedures. these results support the need for standardized guidelines and endoscopic reporting in the management of colorectal lesions. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b879.",AB_0474
"unconstrained handwritten text recognition remains challenging for computer vision systems. paragraph text recognition is traditionally achieved by two models: the first one for line segmentation and the second one for text line recognition. we propose a unified end-to-end model using hybrid attention to tackle this task. this model is designed to iteratively process a paragraph image line by line. it can be split into three modules. an encoder generates feature maps from the whole paragraph image. then, an attention module recurrently generates a vertical weighted mask enabling to focus on the current text line features. this way, it performs a kind of implicit line segmentation. for each text line features, a decoder module recognizes the character sequence associated, leading to the recognition of a whole paragraph. we achieve state-of-the-art character error rate at paragraph level on three popular datasets: 1.91% for rimes, 4.45% for iam and 3.59% for read 2016. our code and trained model weights are available at https://github.com/factodeeplearning/verticalattentionocr.",AB_0474
