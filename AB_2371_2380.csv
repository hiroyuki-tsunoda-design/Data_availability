"background smoking is a risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). few studies have assessed the causal relationship between smoking and copd using mendelian randomization. methods exposure and outcome datasets were obtained from the ieu open gwas project (https:// gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/). the exposure data set includes smoking (ever smoke, smoking/smokers in household, exposure to tobacco smoke at home). the outcome data set includes copd susceptibility and acute copd admissions. the main methods of mendelian randomization analysis are weighted median method and mr-egger method. heterogeneity and polymorphism analyses were performed to ensure the accuracy of the results. resluts ever smoke increased the risk of copd prevalence, and ever smoke and smoking/smokers in household increased the risk of acute copd admission. conclusion therefore, we should enhance the management of nonpharmacological prescription of copd to reduce the individual incidence.",AB_0238
"recent works reveal that re-calibrating intermediate activation of adversarial examples can improve the adversarial robustness of cnn models. the state of the arts exploit this feature at the channel level to help cnn models defend adversarial attacks, where each intermediate activation is uniformly scaled by a factor. however, we conduct a more fine-grained analysis on intermediate activation and observe that adversarial examples only change a portion of elements within an activation. this observation motivates us to investigate a new method to re-calibrate intermediate activation of cnns to improve robustness. instead of uniformly scaling each activation, we individually adjust each element within an activation and thus propose element-wise activation scaling, dubbed ewas, to improve cnns' adversarial robustness. ewas is a simple yet very effective method in enhancing robustness. experimental results on resnet-18 and wideresnet with cifar10 and svhn show that ewas significantly improves the robustness accuracy. especially for resnet18 on cifar10, ewas increases the adversarial accuracy by 37.65% to 82.35% against c & w attack. the code and trained models are available at https://github.com/ieslab-ynu/ewas.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0238
"significant progress has been made in image inpainting methods in recent years. however, they are incapable of producing inpainting results with reasonable structures, rich detail, and sharpness at the same time. in this paper, we propose the pyramid-vae-gan network for image inpainting to address this limitation. our network is built on a variational autoencoder (vae) backbone that encodes high-level latent variables to represent complicated high-dimensional prior distributions of images. the prior assists in reconstructing reasonable structures when inpainting. we also adopt a pyramid structure in our model to maintain rich detail in low-level latent variables. to avoid the usual incompatibility of requiring both reasonable structures and rich detail, we propose a novel cross-layer latent variable transfer module. this transfers information about long-range structures contained in high-level latent variables to low-level latent variables representing more detailed information. we further use adversarial training to select the most reasonable results and to improve the sharpness of the images. extensive experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. our code is available at https://github.com/ thy960112/pyramid-vae-gan.",AB_0238
"background: human breast milk is the primary source of choline and choline-containing compounds for infants at early stages of life. choline data across lactation in chinese human milk were limited. objective: this study aimed to quantify the five choline compounds in chinese human breast milk and explore associated factors. methods: a total of 540 lactating mothers from the muai (maternal nutrition and infant investigation) study were included. the content of water-soluble choline (free choline, phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine) and lipid-soluble choline (phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin) in 892 human milk samples collected from 0 to 400 days postpartum were examined, and associated factors were explored. results: choline concentrations in human milk varied from postpartum day 0-400 (92.06 & plusmn; 65.22 to 171.01 & plusmn; 47.84 mg/l). water-soluble choline was the major component (88.6%-93.8%) in human milk and ranged from 793.03 (659.22) to 1544.43 (443.32) mmol/l. its trajectory followed that of total choline, increasing from colostrum to transitional milk and then declining in mature milk. in contrast, lipidsoluble choline accounted for 6.2%-11.4% over lactation and had an opposite trajectory. choline composition varied by delivery mode and parity history. conclusion: the concentrations of individual choline and choline-containing compounds during lactation in chinese human breast milk were described for the first time. our results address gaps in extant chinese human milk choline data and support tailored dietary reference intakes for chinese lactating women and infants. our data describes the level and profile of choline from 0 to 400 days postpartum in chinese human breast milk. this is the most updated data on choline and also the first report of watersoluble choline as the predominant type in chinese human milk. our results compensate for the deficiencies in data on choline in chinese human milk. clinical trial registration: clinical trial registry number: chictr1800015387. web link to study on registry: https://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx. & copy; 2023 elsevier ltd and european society for clinical nutrition and metabolism. all rights reserved.",AB_0238
"background: recent studies on covid-19 have demonstrated that poverty, comorbidities, race/ ethnicity, population density, mobility, hygiene and use of masks are some of the important correlates of covid-19 outcomes. in fact, weather conditions also play an important role in enhancing or eradicating health issues. based on chinese experience, the development of sars and covid-19 is partially associated with alterations in climate that align with the seasonal shifts of the 24 solar terms. however, the applicability of this pattern to other countries, particularly the united states, which has the highest global incidence and mortality rates, remains subject to ongoing investigation. we need to find more evidence to in the u.s. states verify the relationship between meteorological factors and covid-19 outcomes to provide epidemiological and envi-ronmental support for the covid-19 pandemic prevention and resource preservation.objective: to evaluate the relationship between meteorological factors and coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) mortality.methods: we conducted an ecological cross-sectional study to evaluate the relationship between meteorological factors (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, atmospheric pressure) and covid-19 mortality. this retrospective observational study examines mortality rates among covid-19 patients in the three us states, california, texas, and new york, with the highest fatality numbers, between march 7, 2020 and march 7, 2021. the study draws upon data sourced from the publicly accessible dryad database. the daily corre-sponding meteorological conditions were retrieved from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration global meteorological website (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/hourly/). this study employed multivariate linear regression analysis to assess the correlation between six meteorological factors and covid-19 mortality. gaussian distribution models were utilized to generate smooth curves for examining the linear association between maximum or minimum temperature and mortality. additionally, breakpoint analysis was conducted to evaluate the threshold effect of temperature.results: we found that the death toll of patients with covid-19 decreased with an increase in the highest and lowest ambient temperatures (p < 0.001). in our study, we observed a seasonal difference in mortality rates, with a higher number of deaths occurring during winter months, particularly in january and february. however, mortality rates decreased significantly in march. notably, we found no statistically significant correlation between relative humidity, average precipitation, and average wind speed with covid-19 mortality (all p > 0.05). daily covid-19 death was negatively correlated with the maximum temperature (& beta; =-22, 95% ci,-26.2 to -17.79 -, p < 0.01), while the maximum temperature was below 30 & deg;c. similarly, the number of deaths was negatively correlated with the minimum temperature (& beta; =-27.46, 95% ci,-31.48 to -23.45, p < 0.01), when the minimum temperature was below 8 & deg;c. our study found a significant association between temperature and covid-19 mortality, with every 1 & deg;c increase in maximum or minimum temperature resulting in a decrease of 22 and 27 deceased cases, respectively. the relationship between atmospheric pressure and covid-19 mortality was not fully elucidated due to its complex interaction with maximum temperature. conclusions: this empirical study adds to the existing body of research on the impact of climate factors on covid-19 prevention and resource allocation. policymakers and health scientists may find these findings useful in conjunction with other social factors when making decisions related to covid-19 prevention and resource allocation.",AB_0238
"generalization to previously unseen images with potential domain shifts is essential for clinically applicable medical image segmentation. disentangling domain-specific and domain-invariant features is key for domain generalization (dg). however, existing dg methods struggle to achieve effective disentanglement. to address this problem, we propose an efficient framework called contrastive domain disentanglement and style augmentation (cddsa) for generalizable medical image segmentation. first, a disentangle network decomposes the image into domain-invariant anatomical representation and domain-specific style code, where the former is sent for further segmentation that is not affected by domain shift, and the disentanglement is regularized by a decoder that combines the anatomical representation and style code to reconstruct the original image. second, to achieve better disentanglement, a contrastive loss is proposed to encourage the style codes from the same domain and different domains to be compact and divergent, respectively. finally, to further improve generalizability, we propose a style augmentation strategy to synthesize images with various unseen styles in real time while maintaining anatomical information. comprehensive experiments on a public multi-site fundus image dataset and an in-house multi-site nasopharyngeal carcinoma magnetic resonance image (npc-mri) dataset show that the proposed cddsa achieved remarkable generalizability across different domains, and it outperformed several state-of-the-art methods in generalizable segmentation. code is available at https://github.com/hilab-git/dag4mia.",AB_0238
"the success of the current multi-view clustering lies in the default assumption of completeness on each view, while it is hardly satisfied for real-world applications. incomplete multi-view clustering (imc) studies clustering multi-view instances that are partially observed due to data corruption or sensor failure. although making some progress, the current research suffers from the following obstacles: (1) existing works are always built on pairwise similarity measurement, which cannot fully capture the topological structure of incomplete multi -view samples for precise clustering; (2) due to the absence of partially-observed samples across multiple views, how could we recover and enhance the high-order similarities across different views becomes one of the main bottlenecks of imc; (3) current research mainly aims to handle specific dual-view imc, which greatly limits the deployment in real-world applications. in this paper, we propose a novel tensorized topological graph learning (ttgl) for the generalized incomplete multi-view clustering, which jointly considers the topological graph construction, missing feature completion, and high-order uncertain correlation enhancement. specifically, instead of using pairwise similarity measurement, we formulate a consensus topological graph construction module, which can coalesce affinity matrices to analyze the topological structure of incomplete multi-view data. moreover, we build an iterative missing similarity imputation scheme for feature completion, which ensures the intrinsic similarity preservation on observed instances as well as an imputation on unobserved ones. furthermore, a low-rank tensor structure is imposed to capture the high-order similarities via both feature and similarity enhancement and completion across different views. our method can cluster incomplete data with an arbitrary number of views and any missing statuses. extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method when compared with a series of state-of-the-art imc clustering algorithms. the source code of our ttgl is available at: https://github.com/darrenzzhang/ ttgl.",AB_0238
"motivation: despite low prevalence, rare diseases affect 300 million people worldwide. research on pathogenesis and drug development lags due to limited commercial potential, insufficient epidemiological data, and a dearth of publications. the unique characteristics of rare diseases, including limited annotated data, intricate processes for extracting pertinent entity relationships, and difficulties in standardizing data, represent challenges for text mining. results: we developed a rare disease data acquisition framework using text mining and knowledge graphs and constructed the most comprehensive rare disease knowledge graph to date, rare disease bridge (rdbridge). rdbridge offers search functions for genes, potential drugs, pathways, literature, and medical imaging data that will support mechanistic research, drug development, diagnosis, and treatment for rare diseases. availability and implementation: rdbridge is freely available at http://rdb.lifesynther.com/.",AB_0238
"spatiotemporal modeling is key for action recognition in videos. in this paper, we propose a spatial features compression and temporal features fusion (sctf) block, including a local spatial features compression (lsc) module and a full temporal features fusion (ftf) module, we call the network equipped with sctf block sctf-net, which is a human action recognition network more suitable for violent video detection. the spatial extraction and temporal fusions in previous works are typically achieved by stacking large numbers of convolution layers or adding some complex recurrent neural layers. in contrast, the sctf module extracts the spatial information of video frames by lsc module, and the temporal sequence information of continuous frames is fused by ftf module, which can effectively conduct spatiotemporal modeling. finally, our approach achieves good performance on action recognition benchmarks such as hmdb51 and ucf101. meanwhile, it is more efficient in training and detection. what's more, experiments on violence datasets hockey fights, movie fight and violent flow show that, our proposed sctf block is more suitable for violent action recognition. our code is available at https://github.com/tan-openlab/sctf-net.",AB_0238
"various airway techniques have been used in endoscopic esophageal variceal ligation (evl). in this respect, jcerity endoscoper airway (jea) is a novel laryngeal mask airway that is designed for use in gastrointestinal endoscopy. in the present study, 164 patients who underwent evl were randomly divided into jea group or endotracheal tube (ett) group (ratio: 1:1). success rate of endoscopic procedure, endoscope insertion time, procedure duration, recovery time, airway technique extubation time, anesthesia costs, hospital stay duration, complications, and hemodynamic parameters were recorded. the success rate of evl in the jea group was noninferior to that in the ett group (98.8% vs. 100.0%). the airway insertion time, anesthesia duration, and recovery time were significantly shorter in the jea group than in the ett group (p<0.001). furthermore, the blood pressure during extubation was more stable in the jea group (p<0.001). moreover, there were less heart rate variations during intubation (p<0.005) and extubation (p<0.05) in the jea group. nonetheless, the endoscopists' satisfaction scores were comparable between the two groups. overall, our findings suggest that jea is efficient and safe for clinical use in evl.trial registration: chinese clinical trial registry, chictr2000031892, registered april 13, 2020, https://www.chictr.org.cn/searchproj.html.",AB_0238
