"the widespread application of mass spectrometry (ms)-based proteomics in biomedical research increasingly requires robust, transparent, and streamlined solutions to extract statistically reliable insights. we have designed and implemented alphapeptstats, an inclusive python package with currently with broad functionalities for normalization, imputation, visualization, and statistical analysis of label-free proteomics data. it modularly builds on the established stack of python scientific libraries and is accompanied by a rigorous testing framework with 98% test coverage. it imports the output of a range of popular search engines. data can be filtered and normalized according to user specifications. at its heart, alphapeptstats provides a wide range of robust statistical algorithms such as t-tests, analysis of variance, principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering, and multiple covariate analysis-all in an automatable manner. data visualization capabilities include heat maps, volcano plots, and scatter plots in publication-ready format. alphapeptstats advances proteomic research through its robust tools that enable researchers to manually or automatically explore complex datasets to identify interesting patterns and outliers. availability and implementation: alphapeptstats is implemented in python and part of the alphapept framework. it is released under a permissive apache license. the source code and one-click installers are freely available and on github at https://github.com/mannlabs/ alphapeptstats.",AB_0422
"we present spaxel-by-spaxel stellar population fits for the similar to 10 000 manga data cubes. we provide multiple extension fits files, nominated as megacubes, with maps of several properties as well as emission-line profiles that are provided for each spaxel. all the megacubes are available through a web interface (https://manga.linea.org.br/ or http://www.if.ufrgs.br/similar to riffel/software /megacubes/). we also defined a final active galactic nuclei (agn) sample, as well as a control sample matching the agn host galaxy properties. we have analysed the stellar populations and spatially resolved emission-line diagnostic diagrams of these agns and compared them with the control galaxies sample. we find that the relative fractions of young (t <= 56 myr) and intermediate-age (100 myr <= t <= 2 gyr) show predominantly a positive gradient for both agns and controls. the relative fraction of intermediate-age stellar population is higher in agn hosts when compared to the control sample, and this difference becomes larger for higher [o iii] luminosity agns. we attribute this to the fact that extra gas is available in these more luminous sources and that it most likely originates from mass-loss from the intermediate-age stars. the spatially resolved diagnostic diagrams reveal that the agn emission is concentrated in the inner 0.5 r-e (effective radius) region of the galaxies, showing that the agn classification is aperture dependent and that emission-line ratios have to be taken together with the h aequivalent width for proper activity classification. we present a composite 'bpt+whan' diagram that produces a more comprehensive mapping of the gas excitation.",AB_0422
"introduction social anxiety disorder (sad) has an early onset, a high lifetime prevalence, and may be a risk factor for developing other mental disorders. gaze behaviour is considered an aberrant feature of sad. eye-tracking, a novel technology device, enables recording eye movements in real time, making it a direct and objective measure of gaze behaviour. virtual reality (vr) is a promising tool for assessment and diagnostic purposes. developing an objective screening tool based on examination of gaze behaviour in sad may potentially aid early detection. the objective of this current study is, therefore to examine gaze behaviour in sad utilising vr.methods and analysis a case-control study design is employed in which a clinical sample of 29 individuals with sad will be compared with a matched healthy control group of 29 individuals. in the vr-based eye-tracking paradigm, participants will be presented to stimuli consisting of high-res 360 & deg; 3d stereoscopic videos of three social-evaluative tasks designed to elicit social anxiety. the study will investigate between-group gaze behaviour differences during stimuli presentation.ethics and dissemination the study has been approved by the national committee on health research ethics for the capital region of denmark (h-22041443). the study has been preregistered on osf registries: https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/xctak all participants will be provided with written and oral information. informed consent is required for all the participants. participation is voluntarily, and the participants can at any time terminate their participation without any consequences. study results; positive, negative or inconclusive will be published in relevant scientific journals.ethics and dissemination the study has been approved by the national committee on health research ethics for the capital region of denmark (h-22041443). the study has been preregistered on osf registries: https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/xctak all participants will be provided with written and oral information. informed consent is required for all the participants. participation is voluntarily, and the participants can at any time terminate their participation without any consequences. study results; positive, negative or inconclusive will be published in relevant scientific journals.",AB_0422

"we propose a computational design approach for covering a surface with individually addressable rgb leds, effectively forming a low-resolution surface screen. to achieve a low-cost and scalable approach, we propose creating designs from flat pcb panels bent in-place along the surface of a 3d printed core. working with standard rigid pcbs enables the use of established pcb manufacturing services, allowing the fabrication of designs with several hundred leds. our approach optimizes the pcb geometry for folding, and then jointly optimizes the led packing, circuit and routing, solving a challenging layout problem under strict manufacturing requirements. unlike paper, pcbs cannot bend beyond a certain point without breaking. therefore, we introduce parametric cut patterns acting as hinges, designed to allow bending while remaining compact. to tackle the joint optimization of placement, circuit and routing, we propose a specialized algorithm that splits the global problem into one sub-problem per triangle, which is then individually solved. our technique generates pcb blueprints in a completely automated way. after being fabricated by a pcb manufacturing service, the boards are bent and glued by the user onto the 3d printed support. we demonstrate our technique on a range of physical models and virtual examples, creating intricate surface light patterns from hundreds of leds. the code and data for this paper are available at https://github.com/mfremer/pcbend.",AB_0422
"shape2sas is a web application that allows researchers and students to build intuition about and understanding of small-angle scattering. it is available at https://somo.chem.utk.edu/shape2sas. the user defines a model of arbitrary shape by combining geometrical subunits, and shape2sas then calculates and displays the scattering intensity and the pair distance distribution, as well as a visualization of the user-defined shape. simulated data with realistic noise are also generated. here, it is demonstrated how shape2sas can calculate and display the different scattering patterns for various geometrical shapes, such as spheres and cylinders. it is also shown how the effect of structure factors can be visualized. finally, it is indicated how multi-contrast particles can readily be generated, and how the calculated scattering may be used to validate and visualize analytical models generated in analysis software for fitting small-angle scattering data.",AB_0422
"macroalgal (seaweed) genomic resources are generally lacking as compared with other eukaryotic taxa, and this is particularly true in the red algae (rhodophyta). understanding red algal genomes is critical to understanding eukaryotic evolution given that red algal genes are spread across eukaryotic lineages from secondary endosymbiosis and red algae diverged early in the archaeplastids. the gracilariales is a highly diverse and widely distributed order including species that can serve as ecosystem engineers in intertidal habitats and several notorious introduced species. the genus gracilaria is cultivated worldwide, in part for its production of agar and other bioactive compounds with downstream pharmaceutical and industrial applications. this genus is also emerging as a model for algal evolutionary ecology. here, we report new whole-genome assemblies for two species (gracilaria chilensis and gracilaria gracilis), a draft genome assembly of gracilaria caudata, and genome annotation of the previously published gracilaria vermiculophylla genome. to facilitate accessibility and comparative analysis, we integrated these data in a newly created web-based portal dedicated to red algal genomics (https://rhodoexplorer.sb-roscoff.fr). these genomes will provide a resource for understanding algal biology and, more broadly, eukaryotic evolution.",AB_0422
"in recent years, the navigation capabilities of mobile robots in off-road environments have increased significantly, opening up new potential applications in a variety of settings. by accurately identifying different types of terrain in unstructured environments, safe automated navigation can be supported. however, to enable safe path planning and execution, the traversability costs of the terrain types need to be accurately estimated. such estimations are often performed manually by experts who possess information about the environment and are familiar with the capabilities of the robotic system or using simplified experiments. in this paper, we present an automated pipeline for generating traversability costs that use recorded locomotion data from a realistic experiment and descriptive information on the terrain obtained from earth observation data. the main contribution is that the cost estimation for different terrain types is based on locomotion data obtained in realistic standardized experiments. moreover, by repeating the experiments with different robot systems we are easily able to reflect the actual capabilities of the systems. experiments were conducted in an alpine off-road environment to record locomotion data of four different robot systems and to investigate the performance and validity of the proposed pipeline. the recorded locomotion data for the different robots are publicly available at https://robonav.ist.tugraz.at/data/ & copy; 2023 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0422
"multiple landslide events occur often across the world which have the potential to cause significant harm to both human life and property. although a substantial amount of research has been conducted to address mapping of landslides using earth observation (eo) data, several gaps and uncertainties remain with developing models to be operational at the global scale. the lack of a high-resolution globally distributed and event-diverse dataset for landslide segmentation poses a challenge in developing machine learning models that can accurately and robustly detect landslides in various regions, as the limited representation of landslide and background classes can result in poor generalization performance of the models. to address this issue, we present the high-resolution global landslide detector database (hr-gldd), a high-resolution (hr) satellite dataset (planetscope, 3 m pixel resolution) for landslide mapping composed of landslide instances from 10 different physiographical regions globally in south and south-east asia, east asia, south america, and central america. the dataset contains five rainfall-triggered and five earthquake-triggered multiple landslide events that occurred in varying geomorphological and topographical regions in the form of standardized image patches containing four planetscope image bands (red, green, blue, and nir) and a binary mask for landslide detection. the hrgldd can be accessed through this link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7189381 (meena et al., 2022a, c). hrgldd is one of the first datasets for landslide detection generated by high-resolution satellite imagery which can be useful for applications in artificial intelligence for landslide segmentation and detection studies. five stateof-the-art deep learning models were used to test the transferability and robustness of the hr-gldd. moreover, three recent landslide events were used for testing the performance and usability of the dataset to comment on the detection of newly occurring significant landslide events. the deep learning models showed similar results when testing the hr-gldd at individual test sites, thereby indicating the robustness of the dataset for such purposes. the hr-gldd is open access and it has the potential to calibrate and develop models to produce reliable inventories using high-resolution satellite imagery after the occurrence of new significant landslide events. the hr-gldd will be updated regularly by integrating data from new landslide events.",AB_0422
"hadith is an essential and much-celebrated resource for the islamic domain. it is one of the two primary sources of islamic legislation. the hadith corpus is quite large, consisting of the collection of sayings, actions and silent approval of the prophet muhammad. minimal efforts have been made to date, towards unified semantic modelling, and knowledge representation of the hadith structure for enhanced interlinking and knowledge discovery. this paper presents the design, development and publishing of the hadith corpus as a knowledge graph. first, we design the semantichadith ontology to describe and relate core structural concepts from the hadith. we then publish the six prominent hadith collections as an rdf-based hadith knowledge graph, which is an effort towards making the available hadith both human and machine-readable. this is the first step in the annotation and linking process of the hadith corpus aimed at enabling semantic search capabilities to support scholars, students, and researchers in the creation, evolution, and consultation of a digital representation of islamic knowledge. the semantichadith knowledge graph is freely accessible at http://www.semantichadith.com.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0422
