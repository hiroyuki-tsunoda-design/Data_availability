"technology has grown rapidly in recent years, and new solutions that rely on machine learning (ml) and artificial intelligence (ai) are introduced every day. with such fast-paced advancement, inspecting and fully comprehending how given models make decisions is becoming problematic. the complex decision-making process of these models has become a black box, making it challenging to unravel how they work; therefore, explainable artificial intelligence (xai) methods are crucial for further development. this paper discusses how state-of-theart techniques determine classifications and why they need to be revised to understand the prediction-generating process fully. it compares those existing solutions with the new method called principal image sections mapping - prism, which relies on principal component analysis and allows visualising the most significant features recognised by a given convolutional neural network. prism is implemented in a piece of software called torchprism that can generate and present the clustering based on the method's output. the result can indicate ambiguous classes discrimination; thus, the possibility of automating the output analysis process is also discussed. the paper's main objective is to examine how prism enhances the current understanding of the decision-making process and introduce a tool that can facilitate analysing the output. prism implementation (torchprism) can be found in the public github repository: https:// github .com /szandala /torchprism",AB_0536
"in autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (adas), stereo matching is a challenging research topic. recent work has shown that high-accuracy disparity maps can be obtained with end-to-end training with the help of deep convolutional neural networks from stereo images. however, many of these methods suffer from long run-time for real-time studies. therefore, in this paper, we introduce p3snet, which can generate both real-time results and competitive disparity maps to the state-of-the-art. p3snet architecture consists of two main modules: parallel pyramid pooling and hierarchical disparity aggregation. the parallel pyramid pooling structure makes it possible to obtain local and global information intensively from its multi-scale features. the hierarchical disparity aggregation provides multi-scale disparity maps by using a coarse-to-fine training strategy with the help of the costs obtained from multi-scale features. the proposed approach was evaluated on several benchmark datasets. the results on all datasets showed that the proposed p3snet achieved better or competitive results while having lower runtime. the code is available at https://github.com/aemlek/p3snet.",AB_0536
"early prediction of neonates' survival and length of stay (los) in neonatal intensive care units (nicu) is effective in decision-making. we developed an intelligent system to predict neonatal survival and los using the case-based reasoning (cbr) method. we developed a web-based cbr system based on k-nearest neighborhood (knn) on 1682 neonates and 17 variables for mortality and 13 variables for los and evaluated the system with 336 retrospectively collected data. we implemented the system in a nicu to externally validate the system and evaluate the system prediction acceptability and usability. our internal validation on the balanced case base showed high accuracy (97.02%), and f-score (0.984) for survival prediction. the root mean square error (rmse) for los was 4.78 days. external validation on the balanced case base indicated high accuracy (98.91%), and f-score (0.993) to predict survival. rmse for los was 3.27 days. usability evaluation showed that more than half of the issues identified were related to appearance and rated as a low priority to be fixed. acceptability assessment showed a high acceptance and confidence in responses. the usability score (80.71) indicated high system usability for neonatologists. this system is available at http://neonatalcdss.ir/. positive results of our system in terms of performance, acceptability, and usability indicated this system can be used to improve neonatal care.",AB_0536
"designing compounds with desired properties is a keyelement ofthe drug discovery process. however, measuring progress in the fieldhas been challenging due to the lack of realistic retrospective benchmarks,and the large cost of prospective validation. to close this gap, wepropose a benchmark based on docking, a widely used computationalmethod for assessing molecule binding to a protein. concretely, thegoal is to generate drug-like molecules that are scored highly bysmina, a popular docking software. we observe that various graph-basedgenerative models fail to propose molecules with a high docking scorewhen trained using a realistically sized training set. this suggestsa limitation of the current incarnation of models for de novo drug design. finally, we also include simpler tasks in the benchmarkbased on a simpler scoring function. we release the benchmark as aneasy to use package available at https://github.com/cieplinski-tobiasz/smina-docking-benchmark. we hope that our benchmark will serve as a stepping stone towardthe goal of automatically generating promising drug candidates.",AB_0536
"small molecule structure elucidation using tandem massspectrometry(ms/ms) plays a crucial role in life science, bioanalytical, and pharmaceuticalresearch. there is a pressing need for increased throughput of compoundidentification and transformation of historical data into information-richspectral databases. meanwhile, molecular networking, a recent bioinformaticframework, provides global displays and system-level understandingof complex lc-ms/ms data sets. herein we present mergeion, a multifunctional,modular, and flexible r-based toolbox to streamline spectral databasebuilding, automated structural elucidation, and molecular networking.the toolbox offers diverse tuning parameters and the possibility tocombine various algorithms in the same pipeline. as an open-sourcer package, mergeion is ideally suited for building spectral databasesand molecular networks from privacy-sensitive and preliminary data.using mergeion, we have created an integrated spectral database coveringdiverse pharmaceutical compounds that was successfully applied toannotate drug-related metabolites from a published nontargeted metabolomicsdata set as well as reveal the chemical space behind this complexdata set through molecular networking. moreover, the mergeion-basedprocessing workflow has demonstrated the usefulness of a spectrallibrary search and molecular networking for pharmaceutical forceddegradation studies. mergeion is freely available at: https://github.com/daniellyz/mergeion2.",AB_0536
"archeogenomics is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary research field driven by the development of techniques that enable the acquisition and analysis of ancient dna (adna). recent advances in adna studies have contributed significantly to increasing our understanding of the natural history of humans. one of the most significant challenges facing archeogenomics is the integration of highly heterogeneous genomic, archeological, and anthropological data and their comprehensive analysis, considering changes that occur in time and space. only this complex approach can explain the relationship between past populations in the context of migration or cultural development. to address these challenges, we developed a human ages web server. it focuses on creating comprehensive spatiotemporal visualizations of genomic, archeogenomic, and archeological information, which can be provided by the user or loaded from a graph database. the interactive map application at the center of human ages can display multiple layers of data in various forms, such as bubble charts, pie charts, heatmaps, or tag clouds. these visualizations can be modified using various clustering, filtering, and styling options, and the map state can be exported to a high-resolution image or saved as a session file for later use. human ages, along with their tutorial, are accessible at https://archeogenomics.eu/.",AB_0536
"background: circular rnas (circrnas) are covalently closed-loop rnas with critical regulatory roles in cells. tens of thousands of circrnas have been unveiled due to the recent advances in high throughput rna sequencing technologies and bioinformatic tools development. at the same time, polymerase chain reaction (pcr) cross-validation for circrnas predicted by bioinformatic tools remains an essential part of any circrna study before publication.results: here, we present the circprime web-based platform, providing a user-friendly solution for dna primer design and thermocycling conditions for circrna identifica-tion with routine pcr methods.conclusions: user-friendly circprime web platform (http://circprime.elgene. net/) works with outputs of the most popular bioinformatic predictors of circrnas to design specific circular rna primers. circprime works with circrna coordinates and any refer-ence genome from the national center for biotechnology information database).",AB_0536
"introduction women's mental health has a significant impact on the health of society. due to the prevalence of mental health problems in women with pcos, this study aimed to determine the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy on depression and anxiety (primary outcomes) and quality of life (secondary outcomes) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. methods this randomized controlled trial was performed on 84 patients with pcos referred to al-zahra hospital in tabriz-iran, 2021. participants were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 42) and control (n = 42) groups. counseling with cognitive behavioral therapy was provided in 8 sessions of 60-90 min weekly in groups with 5 to 7 people in each group for the intervention group. spielberger state-trait anxiety, beck depression, and quality of life questionnaire for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (pcosq) were used to collect data. independent t-test and ancova were used to compare the outcomes between the two groups. results after the intervention, based on ancova test with adjusting the baseline values, mean scores of depression (mean difference (md): -18.6; 95% confidence interval (95% ci): -19.4 to -17.8: p < 0.001), trait anxiety (md: -15.0; 95% ci: -16.0 to -13.9; p < 0.001), and state anxiety (md: -15.3; 95% ci: -16.2 to -14.3; p < 0.001), were significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the control group. the mean score of quality of life (md: 19.25; 95% ci: 17.66 to 20.84; p < 0.001) was significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group. conclusion this study showed that cbt was effective in reducing depression and anxiety and improving the quality of life. therefore it is recommended that health care providers use this approach to improve the mental health and quality of life of women with pcos. trial registration iranian registry of clinical trials (irct): irct20110826007418n7. date of registration: 25/10/2021. url: https://en.irct.ir/trial/57348; date of first registration: 25/10/2021",AB_0536
"in the current update, we added a feature for analysing changes in spatial distances between promoters and enhancers in chromatin 3d model ensembles. we updated our datasets by the novel in situ ctcf and rnapii chia-pet chromatin loops obtained from the gm12878 cell line mapped to the grch38 genome assembly and extended the 1000 genomes svs dataset. to handle the new datasets, we applied gpu acceleration for the modelling engine, which gives a speed-up of 30x versus the previous versions. to improve visualisation and data analysis, we embedded the igv tool for viewing chia-pet arcs with additional genes and svs annotations. for 3d model visualisation, we added a new viewer: ngl, where we provided colouring by gene and enhancer location. the models are downloadable in mmcif and xyz format. the web server is hosted and performs calculations on dgx a100 gpu servers that provide optimal performance with multitasking. 3d-gnome 3.0 web server provides unique insights into the topological mechanism of human variations at the population scale with high speed-up and is freely available at https://3dgnome.mini.pw.edu.pl/.
