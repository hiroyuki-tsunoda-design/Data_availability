"emerging evidence suggest migraine is a response to cerebral energy deficiency or oxidative stress in the brain. beta-hydroxybutyrate (bhb) is likely able to circumvent some of the meta-bolic abnormalities reported in migraine. exogenous bhb was given to test this assumption and, in this post-hoc analysis, multiple metabolic biomarkers were identified to predict clinical improvements. a randomized clinical trial, involving 41 patients with episodic migraine. each treatment period was 12 weeks long, followed by eight weeks of washout phase / second run-in phase before entering the corresponding second treatment period. the primary endpoint was the number of migraine days in the last 4 weeks of treatment adjusted for baseline. bhb re-sponders were identified (those with at least a 3-day reduction in migraine days over placebo) and its predictors were evaluated using akaike's information criterion (aic) stepwise boot-strapped analysis and logistic regression. responder analysis showed that metabolic markers could identify a metabolic migraine subgroup, which responded to bhb with a 5.7 migraine days reduction compared to the placebo. this analysis provides further support for a metabolic migraine subtype. additionally, these analyses identified low-cost and easily accessible biomarkers that could guide recruitment in future research on this subgroup of patients.this study is part of the trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov: nct03132233, registered on 27.04.2017, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03132233",AB_0522
"background: severe depression is associated with accelerated brain aging. brainage gap, the difference between predicted and observed brainage, was investigated in patients with late-life depression (lld). we aimed to examine brainage gap in lld and its associations with clinical characteristics indexing lld chronicity, current severity, prior to electroconvulsive therapy (ect) and ect outcome.methods: data was analyzed from the mood disorders in elderly treated with electroconvulsive therapy (modect) study. a previously established brainage algorithm (brainage r by james cole, (https://github. com/james-cole/brainager)) was applied to pre-ect t1-weighted structural mri-scans of 42 patients who un-derwent ect. results: a brainage gap of 1.8 years (sd = 5.5) was observed, cohen's d = 0.3. no significant associations between brainage gap, number of previous episodes, current episode duration, age of onset, depression severity, psychotic symptoms or ect outcome were observed.limitations: limited sample size.conclusions: our initial findings suggest an older brainage than chronological age in patients with severe lld referred for ect, however with high degree of variability and direction of the gap. no associations were found with clinical measures. larger samples are needed to better understand brain aging and to evaluate the usability of brainage gap as potential biomarker of prognosis an treatment-response in lld.trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct02667353",AB_0522
"designing an automatic vehicle detection (avd) system from still images or videos would be a useful tool to cater to the requirements of the traffic management system. over the past few years, numerous databases have been developed for the use of researchers in this field of avd. however, most of them are not acceptable in the indian scenarios due to certain practical constraints like the road infrastructure, nature of congestion, and vehicle types commonly found in india. the aim of this research is to develop a still image database, named as juvdsi v1, which includes nine different types of vehicle classes collected through mobile phone cameras in various ways for designing an automated traffic management system. identifying and analyzing the shortcomings of existing databases, the developed database presents an improvement to address such bottle-necks. furthermore, the efficiency of this database is evaluated using an ensemble of three state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. at first, each vehicle in the scene images is localized and categorized. five base object detection models, namely, yolov3, faster-rcnn, rfcn, ssdv1 and ssdlitev2 are used. finally, the weighted boxes fusion technique is used as the ensemble method (ensemble of best three out of the five base learners), thereby enhancing the performance obtained by the individual object detection models. the database can be found at: https://github.com/juvdsi/juvd-stillimage-database.git.",AB_0522
"background: natural products rich in polyphenols have been shown to lower plasma trimethylamine-n-oxide (tmao) known for its proatherogenic effects by modulating the intestinal microbiota. objectives: we aimed to determine the impact of fruitflow, a water-soluble tomato extract, on tmao, fecal microbiota, and plasma and fecal metabolites. methods: overweight and obese adults (n = 22, bmi 28-35 kg/m2) were included in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study receiving 2x150 mg fruitflow per day or placebo (maltodextrin) for 4 wk with a 6-week wash-out between interventions. stool, blood, and urine samples were collected to assess changes in plasma tmao (primary outcome) as well as fecal microbiota, fecal and plasma metab-olites, and urine tmao (secondary outcomes). in a subgroup (n = 9), postprandial tmao was evaluated following a choline-rich breakfast (similar to 450 mg). statistical methods included paired t-tests or wilcoxon signed rank tests and permutational multivariate analysis of variance. results: fruitflow, but not placebo, reduced fasting levels of plasma (-1.5 mu m, p <= 0.05) and urine (-19.1 mu m, p <= 0.01) tmao as well as plasma lipopolysaccharides (-5.3 ng/ml, p <= 0.05) from baseline to the end of intervention. however, these changes were significant only for urine tmao levels when comparing between the groups (p <= 0.05). changes in microbial beta, but not alpha, diversity paralleled this with a significant difference in jaccard distance-based principal component (p <= 0.05) as well as decreases in bacteroides, ruminococccus, and hungatella and increases in alistipes when comparing between and within groups (p <= 0.05, respectively). there were no between-group differences in scfas and bile acids (bas) in both faces and plasma but several changes within groups such as an increase in fecal cholic acid or plasma pyruvate with fruitflow (p <= 0.05, respectively). an untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed tmao as the most discriminant plasma metabolite between groups (p <= 0.05). conclusions: our results support earlier findings that polyphenol-rich extracts can lower plasma tmao in overweight and obese adults related to gut microbiota modulation. this trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as nct04160481 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ nct04160481?term= fruitflow&draw= 2&rank= 2).",AB_0522
"with the advent of low-cost circuitry, sensor and communication technologies, it is feasible to sense and communicate the condition of surroundings to end user. the wireless networks of these circuits, called wireless sensor network (wsn) that are utilized in a multitude of applications such as in hospitals, smart industries, environmental sensing and military protection. wsn's main issue is efficient data sharing between various sensors and efficient communication with sink. however, in the real-world sensors have restricted range of communication and resources, which in turn imposes constraints for successful coordination in the design of the communication strategy. investigating the trust level of a node is also a significant aspect of wsns using which two sensor nodes can communicate since an untrustworthy node has adverse effect on the reliability and quality of data. the biggest challenge in this domain is to devise a suitable communication system that helps sensors to achieve their target with minimal energy loss and high confidence level transmission of the full exploration data. clustering is an effective way to extend the network performance parameters. in order to address the restrictions in these protocols such as cluster head (ch) lifetime, cluster quality etc.; an enhanced routing protocol with optimum ch selection algorithm and trust management are required to design an efficient wsn framework. a hybrid sooty tern naked mole rat algorithm (stnmra) is developed to mitigate the effect of local stagnation problem in classical naked mole rat algorithm (nmra). in order to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed stnmra, highly challenging cec 2019 numerical test problems are taken into consideration and statistical test validates that stnmra provides better results with respect to competitive algorithms. stnmra based clustering protocol using a fuzzy type-2 logic is proposed in this paper to enhance the trust level and thus the network lifetime. the proposed clustering protocol outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of the efficient removal of malicious nodes together with improved network lifespan and reduced energy consumption. the source code for the proposed algorithms is available at: https://github.com/mittalnitinsvsu/stnmra.",AB_0522
"one of the most frightening and talked-about diseases in the modern world is cancer. huge amounts of research are conducted worldwide to make this ailment less fearsome, be it by finding its cure, discovering ways to detect it in much earlier stages to reduce the mortality rate, or identifying precautions for humans to avoid it. the availability of large collections of biomedical and clinical data has ushered in the use of computer vision for cancer detection, especially for two of its most common types, lung and colon carcinomas. in this work, we present a framework wherein both deep learning and meta-heuristic approaches have been used for the prediction of colon or lung cancer, or both, from histopathological images with near-perfect precision. initially, deep learning models, namely resnet-18 for 2-class classification and efficientnet-b4-widese for 3class and 5-class classification, have been trained on the lc25000 dataset, followed by the extraction of deep features. the feature vector obtained from a deep learning model may have some redundancy. hence, the selection of the most useful features has been done with the application of our proposed hybrid meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, adbet-woa (whale optimization algorithm with integrated adaptive beta-hill climbing local search), utilizing which the support vector machine (svm) classifier classifies the colon cancer test data, lung cancer test data, and both combined with an accuracy of 99.99%, 99.97%, and 99.96%, respectively, matching the benchmark results comprehensively. for comparison, we have used a few independent as well as hybrid optimization algorithms. our proposed approach succeeds greatly in reducing the number of features and also leads to better classification performance, as indicated by the obtained results. the relevant codes for our proposed approach are publicly available at: https://github.com/raj- 1411/adbet-woa",AB_0522
"historical maps depict past states of the earth's surface and make it possible to trace the natural or anthropogenic evolution of geographic objects back through time. however, the state of the depicted reality is not the only source of change: maps of varying age can differ in terms of graphical design, and also in terms of storage conditions, physical ageing of pigments, and the scanning process for digitization. consequently, a computer vision system learned from a specific (source) map series will often not generalize well to older or newer (target) maps, calling for domain adaptation. in the present paper we examine - to our knowledge for the first time - domain adaptation for segmenting historical maps. we argue that for geo-spatial data like maps, which are geo-localized by definition, the spatial co-occurrence of geographical objects provides a supervision signal for domain adaptation. since only a subset of all mapped objects co-occur, and even those are not perfectly aligned due to both real topographic changes and variations in map generalization/production, they only provide weak supervision - still they can bring a substantial benefit over completely unsupervised domain adaptation methods. the core of our proposed method is a novel self-supervised co-occurrence network that detects co-occurring objects across maps (specifically, domains) with a novel loss function that allows for object changes and spatial misalignment. experiments show that, for the task of segmenting hydrological objects such as rivers, lakes and wetlands, our system significantly outperforms two state-of-art baselines, even with limited supervision (e.g., 5%). the source code is publicly available at https://github.com/sian-wusidi/spatialcooccurrence.",AB_0522
"this paper presents a bottom-up methodology to estimate multi-pollutant hourly gridded on-road traffic emission using advanced traffic flow and speed data for delhi. we have used the globally adopted copert (computer programme to calculate emissions from road transport) emission functions to calculate the emission as a function of speed for 127 vehicle categories. at first, the traffic volume and congestion (travel time delay) relation is applied to model the 24 h traffic speed and flow for all the major road links of delhi. the modelled traffic flow and speed shows an anti-correlation behaviour having peak traffic and emissions in morning-evening rush hours. we estimated an annual emission of 1.82 gg for pm (particulate matter), 0.94 gg for bc (black carbon), 0.75 gg for om (organic matter), 221 gg for co (carbon monoxide), 56 gg for nox (oxides of nitrogen), 64 gg for voc (volatile organic compound), 0.28 gg for nh3 (ammonia), 0.26 gg for n2o (nitrous oxide) and 11.38 gg for ch4 (methane) for 2018 with an uncertainty of 60 %-68 %. the hourly emission variation shows bimodal peaks corresponding to morning and evening rush hours and congestion. the minimum emission rates are estimated in the early morning hours whereas the maximum emissions occurred during the evening hours. inner delhi is found to have higher emission flux because of higher road density and relatively lower average speed. petrol vehicles dominate emission share (> 50 %) across all pollutants except pm, bc and nox, and within them the 2w (two-wheeler motorcycles) are the major contributors. diesel-fuelled vehicles contribute most of the pm emission. diesel and cng (compressed natural gas) vehicles have a substantial contribution in nox emission. this study provides very detailed spatiotemporal emission maps for megacity delhi, which can be used in air quality models for developing suitable strategies to reduce the traffic-related pollution. moreover, the developed methodology is a step forward in developing real-time emission with the growing availability of real-time traffic data. the complete dataset is publicly available on zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6553770 (singh et al., 2022).",AB_0522
"background and objective: despite fast evolution cycles in deep learning methodologies for medical imag-ing in radiotherapy, auto-segmentation solutions rarely run in clinics due to the lack of open-source frameworks feasible for processing dicom rt structure sets. besides this shortage, available open-source dicom rt structure set converters rely exclusively on 2d reconstruction approaches leading to pixelated contours with potentially low acceptance by healthcare professionals. pyradise, an open-source, deep learning framework independent python package, addresses these issues by providing a framework for building auto-segmentation solutions feasible to operate directly on dicom data. in addition, pyradise provides profound dicom rt structure set conversion and processing capabilities; thus, it applies also to auto-segmentation-related tasks, such as dataset construction for deep learning model training.methods: the pyradise package follows a holistic approach and provides dicom data handling, deep learning model inference, pre-processing, and post-processing functionalities. the dicom data handling allows for highly automated and flexible handling of dicom image series, dicom rt structure sets, and dicom registrations, including 2d-based and 3d-based conversion from and to dicom rt structure sets. for deep learning model inference, extending given skeleton classes is straightforwardly achieved, al-lowing for employing any deep learning framework. furthermore, a profound set of pre-processing and post-processing routines is included that incorporate partial invertibility for restoring spatial properties, such as image origin or orientation.results: the pyradise package, characterized by its flexibility and automated routines, allows for fast de-ployment and prototyping, reducing efforts for auto-segmentation pipeline implementation. furthermore, while deep learning model inference is independent of the deep learning framework, it can easily be in-tegrated into famous deep learning frameworks such as pytorch or tensorflow. the developed package has successfully demonstrated its capabilities in a research project at our institution for organs-at-risk segmentation in brain tumor patients. furthermore, pyradise has shown its conversion performance for dataset construction.conclusions: the pyradise package closes the gap between data science and clinical radiotherapy by enabling deep learning segmentation models to be easily transferred into clinical research practice. pyradise is available on https://github.com/ubern-mia/pyradise and can be installed directly from the python package index using pip install pyradise .(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license (  )",AB_0522
"we present cosmogridv1: a large set of lightcone simulations for map-level cosmological inference with probes of large scale structure. it is designed for cosmological parameter measurement based on stage-iii photometric surveys with non-gaussian statistics and machine learning. cosmogridv1 spans the wcdm model by varying s2m, cr8, w0, h0, ns, szb, and assumes three degenerate neutrinos with fixed e m = 0.06 ev. this space is covered by 2500 grid points on a sobol sequence. at each grid point, we run 7 simulations with pkdgrav3 and store 69 particle maps at nside = 2048 up to z = 3.5, as well as halo catalog snapshots. the fiducial cosmology has 200 independent simulations, along with their stencil derivatives. an important part of cosmogridv1 is the benchmark set of 28 simulations, which include larger boxes, higher particle counts, and higher redshift resolution of shells. they allow for testing if new types of analyses are sensitive to choices made in cosmogridv1. we add baryon feedback effects on the map level, using shell-based baryon correction model. the shells are used to create maps of weak gravitational lensing, intrinsic alignment, and galaxy clustering, using the ufalcon code. the main part of cosmogridv1 are the raw particle count shells that can be used to create full-sky maps for a given n(z). we also release projected maps for a stage-iii forecast, as well as maps used previously in kids-1000 deep learning constraints with cosmogridv1. the data is available at http://www.cosmogrid.ai/.",AB_0522
