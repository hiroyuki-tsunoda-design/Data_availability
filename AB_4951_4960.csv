"motivation: machine learning has shown extensive growth in recent years and is now routinely applied to sensitive areas. to allow appropriate verification of predictive models before deployment, models must be deterministic. solely fixing all random seeds is not sufficient for deterministic machine learning, as major machine learning libraries default to the usage of nondeterministic algorithms based on atomic operations. results: various machine learning libraries released deterministic counterparts to the nondeterministic algorithms. we evaluated the effect of these algorithms on determinism and runtime. based on these results, we formulated a set of requirements for deterministic machine learning and developed a new software solution, the mlf-core ecosystem, which aids machine learning projects to meet and keep these requirements. we applied mlf-core to develop deterministic models in various biomedical fields including a single-cell autoencoder with tensorflow, a pytorch-based u-net model for liver-tumor segmentation in computed tomography scans, and a liver cancer classifier based on gene expression profiles with xgboost. availability and implementation: the complete data together with the implementations of the mlf-core ecosystem and use case models are available at https://github.com/mlf-core.",AB_0496
"purpose - the evaluation of the haptics of water taps and wear-related changes during usage usually involves time- and cost-intensive testing. the purpose of this paper is to abstract the tribo-system between technical ceramic disks of water tap mixer cartridges to the model level and study the tribological behavior. design/methodology/approach - the friction and wear behavior was studied by means of an alumina ball-on-original alumina disk setup at different temperatures as well as under dry conditions and under lubrication by different greases. thereby, the frictional behavior was measured in situ, and the wear losses were analyzed by means of laser scanning microscopy. findings - it was shown that friction and wear can behave in a contrasting way, whereby one grease might lead to low friction, that is, an easygoing movability of the water tap, but to increased wear losses. the latter, in turn, is an indicator for the usability and service life, which cannot be explained from friction alone. thereby, the viscosity of the base oil, the grease consistency and additives were identified as relevant grease formulation parameters to allow for fluid film (re-)formation and removal of wear particles. originality/value - to the authors' best knowledge, this is the first approach to systematically analyze the friction and wear behavior of technical ceramic disks of water tap mixer cartridges in dependency on the temperature as well as the used lubricating grease. this approach is relevant for developing screening test strategies as well as for the selection of lubricants for water tap applications. peer review - the peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/ilt-11-2022-0334/",AB_0496
"zebrafish have the capacity to fully regenerate the heart after an injury, which lies in sharp contrast to the irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes after a myocardial infarction in humans. transcriptomics analysis has contributed to dissect underlying signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks in the zebrafish heart regeneration process. this process has been studied in response to different types of injuries namely: ventricular resection, ventricular cryoinjury, and genetic ablation of cardiomyocytes. however, there exists no database to compare injury specific and core cardiac regeneration responses. here, we present a meta-analysis of transcriptomic data of regenerating zebrafish hearts in response to these three injury models at 7 days post injury (7dpi). we reanalyzed 36 samples and analyzed the differentially expressed genes (deg) followed by downstream gene ontology biological processes (go:bp) analysis. we found that the three injury models share a common core of deg encompassing genes involved in cell proliferation, the wnt signaling pathway and genes that are enriched in fibroblasts. we also found injury-specific gene signatures for resection and genetic ablation, and to a lower extent the cryoinjury model. finally, we present our data in a user-friendly web interface that displays gene expression signatures across different injury types and highlights the importance to consider injury-specific gene regulatory networks when interpreting the results related to cardiac regeneration in the zebrafish. the analysis is freely available at: https:// mybin der. org/ v2/ gh/ merca derla banat omy/ pub_ botos_ et_ al_ 2022_ shiny app_ binder/ head? urlpa th= shiny/ bus- dashb oard/.",AB_0496
"although beta-amyloid (a beta) and phosphorylated tau remain the preferred targets for disease-modifying treatments (dmt) against alzheimer's disease (ad), part of the pathophysiological mechanisms of cognitive impairment are related to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. in mild cognitive impairment (mci), a prodromal stage of ad and other neurodegenerative conditions, the joint appearance of inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic alterations are the common pathways of neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. the standardized extract of ginkgo biloba egb 761 interferes with the pathogenic mechanisms involved in both the development of cognitive impairment due to ad and that of vascular origin. the primary objective of this study is to compare changes in the levels of blood markers of inflammation and oxidative stress after treatment with egb 761 in a cohort of 100 patients with mci. in addition, we aim to assess changes in these blood markers during an additional 12-month extension phase in which patients in the control group will also receive egb 761 and patients in the active group will extend their treatment duration. secondary objectives include comparing changes in neuropsychiatric and cognitive test scores between the baseline (v0) and 12-month visits (v2). this study is a phase iv, single-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group clinical trial consisting of the 12-month follow-up of a cohort of participants with mci [global deterioration scale (gds) = 3] and an extension with an additional 12-month follow-up. during the first 12 months, participants will be randomized into two arms: in one arm, patients will receive 1 daily tablet of egb 761 240 mg orally (study group, n = 50), while in the other arm, patients will not receive egb 761 and will undergo the same assessments as the treated group (control group, n = 50). after the first 12 months of the study, patients in the egb 761-treated group will continue treatment, and patients in the control group will be offered one egb 761 240 mg tablet per day orally. all participants will be monitored for an additional 12 months. a battery of blood markers of inflammation and oxidative stress will be quantified at v0, v1, v2, v3, and v4. the olink proteomics panel of inflammation markers (https://www.olink.com/products/inflammation/) will be used to evaluate 92 proteins associated with inflammatory diseases and related biological processes. the second panel measures 92 proteins involved in neurological processes. at v0, v2, and v4, neuropsychological and neurological evaluations will be conducted in addition to vital signs and anthropometric studies using a body composition monitor with bioimpedance technology (tanita). sixty percent of the 100 mci patients recruited were women. the mean age was 73.1 years, and the mean time between symptom onset and mci diagnosis was 2.9 years. the mean mini-mental state examination (mmse) score was 26.7. depressive and anxiety disorders, as well as vascular risk factors, were the most frequent comorbidities among the cohort. the study is still ongoing, and results for the first year of treatment (v0, v1, v2) are expected by 2023. individuals with mci have an elevated risk of developing dementia. egb 761 is used worldwide for the symptomatic treatment of cognitive disorders due to its neuroprotective effects. in experimental models and clinical observational studies, egb 761 has shown strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. as a result, this study has been proposed to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on plasma markers and their potential clinical correlation with the progression of cognitive decline in patients with mci.",AB_0496
"background: short-term trials indicate improvement of intrahepatic lipids (ihls) and metabolism by dietary protein or unsaturated fatty acids (ufas) beyond weight loss. objectives: we aimed to assess the effect of a dietary intervention high in protein and ufas on ihls and metabolic outcome after 12 mo, as long-term effects of such a combined intervention are unknown. methods: within a 36-mo randomized controlled trial, eligible subjects (aged 50 to 80 y, >= 1 risk factor for unhealthy aging) were randomly assigned to either intervention group (ig) with high intake of mono-/poly-ufas [15-20 percent of total energy (%e)/10%-15%e, respectively], plant protein (15%- 25%e), and fiber (>= 30 g/d), or control group [cg, usual care, dietary recommendations of the german nutrition society (fat 30%e/carbohydrates 55%e/ protein 15%e)]. stratification criteria were sex, known cardiovascular disease, heart failure, arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cognitive or physical impairment. nutritional counseling and supplementation of foods mirroring the intended dietary pattern were performed in the ig. diet-induced effects on ihls, analyzed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as on lipid and glucose metabolism were predefined secondary endpoints. results: ihl content was analyzed in 346 subjects without significant alcohol consumption at baseline and in 258 subjects after 12 mo. adjusted for weight loss, sex, and age, we observed a comparable decline of ihls in ig and cg (-33.3%; 95% ci: -49.3, -12.3%; n = 128 compared with-21.8%; 95% ci: -39.7, 1.5%; n = 130; p = 0.179), an effect that became significant by comparing adherent ig subjects to adherent cg subjects (-42.1%; 95% ci: -58.1, -20.1%; n = 88 compared with-22.2%; 95% ci: -40.7, 2.0%; n = 121; p = 0.013). compared with the cg, decline of ldl cholesterol (ldl-c) and total cholesterol (tc) was stronger in the ig (for ldl-c p = 0.019, for tc p = 0.010). both groups decreased in triglycerides and insulin resistance (p for difference between groups p = 0.799 and p = 0.124, respectively). conclusions: diets enriched with protein and ufas have beneficial long-term effects on liver fat and lipid metabolism in adherent older subjects. this study was registered at the german clinical trials register, https://www.drks.de/drks_web/setlocale_en.do, drks00010049. am j clin nutr 20xx;xx:xx-xx.",AB_0496
"objective acute hydrocephalus is a frequent complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (asah). among patients needing csf diversion, some cannot be weaned. little is known about the comparative neurological, neuropsychological, and health-related quality-of-life (hrqol) outcomes in patients with successful and unsuccessful csf weaning. the authors aimed to assess outcomes of patients by comparing those with successful and unsuccessful csf weaning; the latter was defined as occurring in patients with permanent csf diversion at 3 months post-asah. methods the authors included prospectively recruited alert (i.e., glasgow coma scale score 13-15) patients with asah in this retrospective study from six swiss neurovascular centers. patients underwent serial neurological (national institutes of health stroke scale), neuropsychological (montreal cognitive assessment), disability (modified rankin scale), and hrqol (euroqol-5d) examinations at < 72 hours, 14-28 days, and 3 months post-asah. results of 126 included patients, 54 (42.9%) developed acute hydrocephalus needing csf diversion, of whom 37 (68.5%) could be successfully weaned and 17 (31.5%) required permanent csf diversion. patients with unsuccessful weaning were older (64.5 vs 50.8 years, p = 0.003) and had a higher rate of intraventricular hemorrhage (52.9% vs 24.3%, p = 0.04). patients who succeed in restoration of physiological csf dynamics improve on average by 2 points on the montreal cognitive assessment between 48-72 hours and 14-28 days, whereas those in whom weaning fails worsen by 4 points (adjusted coefficient 6.80, 95% ci 1.57-12.04, p = 0.01). they show better neuropsychological recovery between 48-72 hours and 3 months, compared to patients in whom weaning fails (adjusted coefficient 7.60, 95% ci 3.09-12.11, p = 0.02). patients who receive permanent csf diversion (ventriculoperitoneal shunt) show significantneuropsychological improvement thereafter, catching up the delay in neuropsychological improvement between 14-28 days and 3 months post-asah. neurological, disability, and hrqol outcomes at 3 months were similar. conclusions these results show a temporary but clinically meaningful cognitive benefit in the first weeks after asah in successfully weaned patients. the resolution of this difference over time may be due to the positive effects of permanent csf diversion and underlines its importance. patients who do not show progressive neuropsychological improvement after weaning should be considered for repeat ct imaging to rule out chronic (untreated) hydrocephalus. clinical trial registration no.: nct03032471 (clinicaltrials.gov) https:// thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2023.1. focus22638",AB_0496
"mass spectrometry imaging vows to enable simultaneous spatially resolved investigation of hundreds of metabolites in tissues, but it primarily relies on traditional ion images for non-data-driven metabolite visualization and analysis. the rendering and interpretation of ion images neither considers nonlinearities in the resolving power of mass spectrometers nor does it yet evaluate the statistical significance of differential spatial metabolite abundance. here, we outline the computational framework molecular (https://github.com/cemos-mannheim/molecular) that is expected to improve signal reliability by data-dependent gaussian-weighting of ion intensities and that introduces probabilistic molecular mapping of statistically significant nonrandom patterns of relative spatial abundance of metabolites-of-interest in tissue. molecular also enables cross-tissue statistical comparisons and collective molecular projections of entire biomolecular ensembles followed by their spatial statistical significance evaluation on a single tissue plane. it thereby fosters the spatially resolved investigation of ion milieus, lipid remodeling pathways, or complex scores like the adenylate energy charge within the same image.",AB_0496
"background: contamination detection is a important step that should be carefully considered in early stages when designing and performing microbiome studies to avoid biased outcomes. detecting and removing true contaminants is challenging, especially in low-biomass samples or in studies lacking proper controls. interactive visualizations and analysis platforms are crucial to better guide this step, to help to identify and detect noisy patterns that could potentially be contamination. additionally, external evidence, like aggregation of several contamination detection methods and the use of common contaminants reported in the literature, could help to discover and mitigate contamination. results: we propose grimer, a tool that performs automated analyses and generates a portable and interactive dashboard integrating annotation, taxonomy, and metadata. it unifies several sources of evidence to help detect contamination. grimer is independent of quantification methods and directly analyzes contingency tables to create an interactive and offline report. reports can be created in seconds and are accessible for nonspecialists, providing an intuitive set of charts to explore data distribution among observations and samples and its connections with external sources. further, we compiled and used an extensive list of possible external contaminant taxa and common contaminants with 210 genera and 627 species reported in 22 published articles. conclusion: grimer enables visual data exploration and analysis, supporting contamination detection in microbiome studies. the tool and data presented are open source and available at https://gitlab.com/dacs-hpi/grimer.",AB_0496
"contemporary question answering (qa) systems, including transformer-based architectures, suffer from increasing computational and model complexity which render them inefficient for real-world applications with limited resources. furthermore, training or even fine-tuning such models requires a vast amount of labeled data which is often not available for the task at hand. in this manuscript, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the mentioned challenges and introduce suitable countermeasures. we propose a novel knowledge distillation (kd) approach to reduce the parameter and model complexity of a pre-trained bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (bert) system and utilize multiple active learning (al) strategies for immense reduction in annotation efforts. we show the efficacy of our approach by comparing it with four state-of-the-art (sota) transformers-based systems, namely kroneckerbert, efficientbert, tinybert, and distilbert. specifically, we outperform kroneckerbert21 and efficientberttiny by 4.5 and 0.4 percentage points in em, despite having 75.0% and 86.2% fewer parameters, respectively. additionally, our approach achieves comparable performance to 6-layer tinybert and distilbert while using only 2% of their total trainable parameters. besides, by the integration of our al approaches into the bert framework, we show that sota results on the qa datasets can be achieved when we only use 40% of the training data. overall, all results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in achieving sota performance, while extremely reducing the number of parameters and labeling efforts. finally, we make our code publicly available at https://github.com/mirbostani/qa-kd-al.",AB_0496
"sexism is an increasingly prevalent problem in the gaming community. however, until now, assessment instruments focused on the construct sexism against women gamers are lacking. we present an eight-item self-report scale: sexism against women gamers scale (sawgs). we studied the reliability and validity of the scores of spanish and english versions across five independent samples (n= 2,437), with participants from spain and the united states. scores on both versions demonstrated high reliability, while exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported their unidimensional structure. the analysis established configural, metric, and scalar invariance across gender. sawgs was invariant at the configural level across countries. sawgs scores were independent of social desirability, positively correlated with myths about intimate-partner violence against women, sexism, and social dominance orientation, and correlated negatively with feminism. using two fictitious scenarios of sexism in online gaming, we found that gamers with higher scores on sawgs showed a greater tendency to downplay a sexist incident and proposed a less severe punishment for toxic gamers. the sawgs explained additional variance on responses to scenarios beyond that explained by other measures. the detection of sexism should make it possible to develop programs for its eradication and avoid negative consequences for women gamers. additional online materials for this article are available on pwq's website at http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/03616843231162837",AB_0496
