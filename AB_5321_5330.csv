"proteins interact with many molecules in order to maintain the vital activities in cells. proteins that interact with dna are called dna-binding proteins (dbp), and proteins that interact with rna are called rna-binding proteins (rbp). since dbps and rbps are involved in critical biological processes, their classification is quite important. although the convolutional neural network and bidirectional long-short-term memory hybrid model (cnn-bilstm) is very popular in dbp and rbp classification, it has problems such as requirement of high processing power and long training time. therefore, a multilayer perceptron (mlp) based predictor, preddrbpmlp (predictor of dna-binding proteins and rna-binding proteins - multilayer perceptron) was developed in this study. preddrbp-mlp is an artificial learning model that performs multi-class classification of dbps, rbps and non-nucleic acid-binding proteins (nnabp). preddrbp-mlp achieved quite successful results on the independent dataset, specifically in the nnabp class, compared to the existing predictors, in addition to requiring lower processing power and being able to train quicker compared to cnn-bilstm based predictors. in nnabp class, preddrbp-mlp predictor achieved 0.578 precision, 0.522 recall and 0.549 f1-score, while other multiclass predictor achieved 0.486 precision, 0.183 recall and 0.266 f1-score. a desktop application was developed for preddrbp-mlp. the application is freely accessible at https://sourceforge.net/projects/preddrbp-mlp.",AB_0533
"the design of compounds that target specific biological functions with relevant selectivity is critical in the context of drug discovery, especially due to the polypharmacological nature of most existing drug molecules. in recent years, in silico-based methods combined with deep learning have shown promising results in the de novo drug design challenge, leading to potential leads for biologically interesting targets. however, several of these methods overlook the importance of certain properties, such as validity rate and target selectivity, or simplify the generative process by neglecting the multi-objective nature of the pharmacological space. in this study, we propose a multi-objective transformer-based architecture to generate drug candidates with desired molecular properties and increased selectivity toward a specific biological target. the framework consists of a transformer-decoder generator that generates novel and valid compounds in the smiles format notation, a transformer-encoder predictor that estimates the binding affinity toward the biological target, and a feedback loop combined with a multi-objective optimization strategy to rank the generated molecules and condition the generating distribution around the targeted properties. the results demonstrate that the proposed architecture can generate novel and synthesizable small compounds with desired pharmacological properties toward a biologically relevant target. the unbiased transformer-based generator achieved superior performance in the novelty rate (97.38%) and comparable performance in terms of internal diversity, uniqueness, and validity against state-of-the-art baselines. the optimization of the unbiased transformer-based generator resulted in the generation of molecules exhibiting high binding affinity toward the adenosine a2a receptor (aa2ar) and possessing desirable physicochemical properties, where 99.36% of the generated molecules follow lipinski's rule of five. furthermore, the implementation of a feedback strategy, in conjunction with a multi-objective algorithm, effectively shifted the distribution of the generated molecules toward optimal values of molecular weight, molecular lipophilicity, topological polar surface area, synthetic accessibility score, and quantitative estimate of drug-likeness, without the necessity of prior training sets comprising molecules endowed with pharmacological properties of interest. overall, this research study validates the applicability of a transformer-based architecture in the context of drug design, capable of exploring the vast chemical representation space to generate novel molecules with improved pharmacological properties and target selectivity. the data and source code used in this study are available at: https://github.com/larngroup/fsm-ddtr.",AB_0533
"pig detection in real production environments is a challenging task due to the variations of housing system and dynamic background. though considerable progress has been made, for practical settings, there still existing challenges for densely housed pigs as they are often arbitrarily arranged at varying orientations in presence of lens distortion, overlap, occlusion, and motion blur. in this paper, we propose a rotated and oriented bounding box detector for fast and accurate predict the location and orientation of each animal. the key point is to parameterize pigs' geometric parameters (body centre, body length, body width, orientation) with an orientated bounding box (box centre, long edge, short edge and direction vector). to further improve the performance on video object detection, a fast sequential non-maximum suppression (fastseq-nms) method is proposed by making used of the orientation and temporal information. to quantitative evaluate the proposed method, 3123 images from 27 different pens were selected as training and validation sets, video clips from three new environments were selected as test set. our lightweight model (1.7 m) achieves 99.21 average precision (ap@0.5) on validation set, and 96.54 ap@0.5 on test set, further improved to 97.41 ap@0.5 with the proposed nms method. the experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method. more information available online: https://gi tlab.kuleuven.be/m3-biores/public/m3pig.",AB_0533
"background chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) is a disabling illness of unknown aetiology. disruption of gut microbiota may play a role in several neurological disorders. in this study, the effect of faecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) on fatigue severity and health-related quality of life (hrqol) in patients with cfs was evaluated. methods randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial. patients and researchers were blinded to treatment assignment. 11 patients with cfs (10 female and 1 male, mean age 42.2 years and mean duration of cfs 6.3 years) were randomly assigned to receive either fmt from a universal donor (n = 5) or autologous fmt (n = 6) via colonoscopy. patients' hrqol was assessed by using visual analog scale ( vas) and self-reporting questionnaires modified fatigue impact scale (mfis), 15d and eq-5d-3l. patients' hrqol was evaluated at baseline, and 1 and 6 months after the fmt. results the baseline vas scores in the fmt and placebo groups were 62.4 and 76.0 (p = 0.29). 1-month scores were 60.0 and 73.7 and 6-months scores 72.8 and 69.5, respectively. total mfis scores in the fmt and placebo groups were 59.6 and 61.0 at the baseline (p = 0.80), 53.5 and 62.0 at 1 month and 58.6 and 56.2 at 6 months. compared to the baseline scores, differences at 1 and 6 months were statistically insignificant both in vas and in mfis. the 15d and eq-5d-3l profiles did not change after the fmt or placebo. fmt-related adverse events were not reported. conclusion fmt was safe but did not relieve symptoms or improve the hrqol of patients with cfs. small number of study subjects limits the generalizability of these results. trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct04158427, https://register.clinicaltrials.gov, date of registration 08/08/2019.",AB_0533
"motivation: de novo drug development is a long and expensive process that poses significant challenges from the design to the preclinical testing, making the introduction into the market slow and difficult. this limitation paved the way to the development of drug repurposing, which consists in the re-usage of already approved drugs, developed for other therapeutic indications. although several efforts have been carried out in the last decade in order to achieve clinically relevant drug repurposing predictions, the amount of repurposed drugs that have been employed in actual pharmacological therapies is still limited. on one hand, mechanistic approaches, including profile-based and network-based methods, exploit the wealth of data about drug sensitivity and perturbational profiles as well as disease transcriptomics profiles. on the other hand, chemocentric approaches, including structure-based methods, take into consideration the intrinsic structural properties of the drugs and their molecular targets. the poor integration between mechanistic and chemocentric approaches is one of the main limiting factors behind the poor translatability of drug repurposing predictions into the clinics. results: in this work, we introduce dream, an r package aimed to integrate mechanistic and chemocentric approaches in a unified computational workflow. dream is devoted to the druggability evaluation of pathological conditions of interest, leveraging robust drug repurposing predictions. in addition, the user can derive optimized sets of drugs putatively suitable for combination therapy. in order to show the functionalities of the dream package, we report a case study on atopic dermatitis. availability and implementation: dream is freely available at https://github.com/fhaive/dream. the docker image of dream is available at: https://hub.docker.com/r/fhaive/dream.",AB_0533
"cilia are found in eukaryotic species ranging from single-celled organisms, such as chlamydomonas reinhardtii, to humans, but not in plants. the ability to respond to repellents and/or attractants, regulate cell proliferation and differentiation and provide cellular mobility are just a few examples of how crucial cilia are to cells and organisms. over 30 distinct rare disorders generally known as ciliopathy are caused by abnormalities or functional impairments in cilia and cilia-related compartments. because of the complexity of ciliopathies and the rising number of ciliopathies and ciliopathy genes, a ciliopathy-oriented and up-to-date database is required. here, we present ciliaminer, a manually curated ciliopathy database that includes ciliopathy lists collected from articles and databases. analysis reveals that there are 55 distinct disorders likely related to ciliopathy, with over 4000 clinical manifestations. based on comparative symptom analysis and subcellular localization data, diseases are classified as primary, secondary or atypical ciliopathies. ciliaminer provides easy access to all of these diseases and disease genes, as well as clinical features and gene-specific clinical features, as well as subcellular localization of each protein. additionally, the orthologs of disease genes are also provided for mice, zebrafish, xenopus, drosophila, caenorhabditis elegans and chlamydomonas reinhardtii. ciliaminer (https://kaplanlab.shinyapps.io/ciliaminer) aims to serve the cilia community with its comprehensive content and highly enriched interactive heatmaps, and will be continually updated.",AB_0533
"background: interprofessional communication is needed to enhance the early recognition and management of patients with sepsis. preparing medical and nursing students using virtual reality simulation has been shown to be an effective learning approach for sepsis team training. however, its scalability is constrained by unequal cohort sizes between medical and nursing students. an artificial intelligence (ai) medical team member can be implemented in a virtual reality simulation to engage nursing students in sepsis team training. objective: this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an ai-powered doctor versus a human-controlled doctor in training nursing students for sepsis care and interprofessional communication. methods: a randomized controlled trial study was conducted with 64 nursing students who were randomly assigned to undertake sepsis team training with an ai-powered doctor (ai-powered group) or with medical students using virtual reality simulation (human-controlled group). participants from both groups were tested on their sepsis and communication performance through simulation-based assessments (posttest). participants' sepsis knowledge and self-efficacy in interprofessional communication were also evaluated before and after the study interventions. results: a total of 32 nursing students from each group completed the simulation-based assessment, sepsis and communication knowledge test, and self-efficacy questionnaire. compared with the baseline scores, both the ai-powered and human-controlled groups demonstrated significant improvements in communication knowledge (p=.001) and self-efficacy in interprofessional communication (p<.001) in posttest scores. for sepsis care knowledge, a significant improvement in sepsis care knowledge from the baseline was observed in the ai-powered group (p<.001) but not in the human-controlled group (p=.16). although no significant differences were found in sepsis care performance between the groups (ai-powered group: mean 13.63, sd 4.23, vs human-controlled group: mean 12.75, sd 3.85, p=.39), the ai-powered group (mean 9.06, sd 1.78) had statistically significantly higher sepsis posttest knowledge scores (p=.009) than the human-controlled group (mean 7.75, sd 2.08). no significant differences were found in interprofessional communication performance between the 2 groups (ai-powered group: mean 29.34, sd 8.37, vs human-controlled group: mean 27.06, sd 5.69, p=.21). however, the human-controlled group (mean 69.6, sd 14.4) reported a significantly higher level of self-efficacy in interprofessional communication (p=.008) than the ai-powered group (mean 60.1, sd 13.3). conclusions: our study suggested that ai-powered doctors are not inferior to human-controlled virtual reality simulations with respect to sepsis care and interprofessional communication performance, which supports the viability of implementing ai-powered doctors to achieve scalability in sepsis team training. our findings also suggested that future innovations should focus on the sociability of ai-powered doctors to enhance users' interprofessional communication training. perhaps in the nearer term, future studies should examine how to best blend ai-powered training with human-controlled virtual reality simulation to optimize clinical performance in sepsis care and interprofessional communication. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct05953441; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/nct05953441",AB_0533
"tracking the behaviour of animals in group-housed situations is a critical area of study for precision livestock farming, but it poses challenges in diverse and crowded environments. existing methods often struggle with false positives and false negatives due to the complexities of these scenarios. in this study, we propose a robust computer vision algorithm for long-term (>10mins) animal tracking, with a primary focus on group-housed pigs. our method addresses the limitations of current approaches by effectively handling errors from the detector in challenging environments. our approach integrates graph convolutional networks.(gcns) with deep learning-based object detection techniques. we represent the data as a graph structure, with nodes corresponding to multiple animal detections over several frames. edges connect the detections that do not appear in the same frame. the model's objective is to perform edge classification, where each edge is associated with a scalar representing the probability of being the same object. to enhance the robustness of edge classification, we combine the classifier with an ensemble predictor, enabling accurate tracking of animal identities for extended periods. notably, our graph convolutional model achieves accurate re identification of non-consecutive animal detections in real-time without the need for trajectory prediction or id association. we evaluate our method by comparing its performance against other tracking methods, including deepsort-a state-of-the-art animal tracking method that relies on a kalman filter, a deep appearance descriptor, and the hungarian algorithm for trajectory prediction and id association. our comparison demonstrates the advantages of our method, as it (1) improves the idf1 score, indicating enhanced id association accuracy, by 1.72%; (2) mitigates 93% of errors resulting from id-switch and deviation; (3) extends the tracking duration of each animal by approximately 66% in challenging conditions; and (4) achieves a processing speed that is 1000 times faster than deepsort when operating at 22fps with the detector. the potential applications of our method extend to various aspects of livestock management. by accurately tracking individual animals, we can monitor behaviours such as feeding, drinking, and aggressive interactions. this information can lead to improvements in animal welfare, resource allocation, and breeding strategies. follow-ups of this research are available at: https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/m3-biores/public/m3pig.",AB_0533

"we propose medial atom ray fields (marfs), a novel neural object representation that enables accurate differentiable surface rendering with a single network evaluation per camera ray. existing neural ray fields struggle with multi-view consistency and representing surface discontinuities. marfs address both using a medial shape representation, a dual representation of solid geometry that yields cheap geometrically grounded surface normals, in turn enabling computing analytical curvature despite the network having no second derivative. marfs map a camera ray to multiple medial intersection candidates, subject to ray-sphere intersection testing. we illustrate how the learned medial shape quantities applies to sub-surface scattering, part segmentation, and aid representing a space of articulated shapes. able to learn a space of shape priors, marfs may prove useful for tasks like shape retrieval and shape completion, among others. code and data can be found at https://github.com/pbsds/marf.& copy; 2023 the authors. published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0533
