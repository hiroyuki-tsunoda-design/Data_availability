"short-term origin-destination(od) matrix prediction in metro systems aims to predict the number of passenger demands from one station to another during a short time period. that is crucial for dynamic traffic operations, e.g., route recommendation, metro scheduling. however, existing methods need further improvement due to that they fail to take full use of the real-time traffic information and model the complex spatiotemporal correlation of traffic flows. in this paper, a multi-view passenger flow (mvpf) evolution trend based od matrix prediction method is proposed. it consists of two components focusing on individual station and cross-station learning. specifically, the individual station level part uses gate recurrent unit and extended graph attention networks combined model to learn the high-level spatiotemporal-dependent representation of each station as the roles of origin and destination respectively, by considering multiple views of real-time traffic information (i.e., inflow, destination allocation of inflow, outflow, origin allocations of outflow). the cross-station part aims to learn passenger mobility pattern from each origin to destination through defining a transition matrix under spatiotemporal context. compared with state-of-the-art solutions, mvpf increases the od prediction performance metric of wmape by 2.5% on average. the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of mvpf against other competitors. the source code is available at https://github.com/zfrinsiat/mvpf-code.",AB_0245
"consensus clustering provides an elegant framework to aggregate multiple weak clustering results to learn a consensus one that is more robust and stable than a single result. however, most of the existing methods usually use all data for consensus learning, whereas ignoring the side effects caused by some unreliable or difficult data. to address this issue, in this article, we propose a novel self-paced consensus clustering method with adaptive bipartite graph learning to gradually involve data from more reliable to less reliable ones in consensus learning. at first, we construct an initial bipartite graph from the base results, where the nodes represent the clusters and instances, and the edges indicate that an instance belongs to a cluster. then, we adaptively learn a structured bipartite graph from this initial one by self-paced learning, i.e., we automatically determine the reliability of each edge with adaptive cluster similarity measuring and involve the edges in bipartite graph learning in order of their reliability. at last, we obtain the final consensus result from the learned structured bipartite graph. we conduct extensive experiments on both toy and benchmark datasets, and the results show the effectiveness and superiority of our method. the codes of this article are released in http://doctor- nobody.github.io/codes/code_sccabg.zip.",AB_0245
"weakly supervised segmentation (wss) aims to exploit weak forms of annotations to achieve the segmentation training, thereby reducing the burden on annotation. however, existing methods rely on large-scale centralized datasets, which are difficult to construct due to privacy concerns on medical data. federated learning (fl) provides a cross-site training paradigm and shows great potential to address this problem. in this work, we represent the first effort to formulate federated weakly supervised segmentation (fedwss) and propose a novel federated drift mitigation (feddm) framework to learn segmentation models across multiple sites without sharing their raw data. feddm is devoted to solving two main challenges (i.e., local drift on client-side optimization and global drift on server-side aggregation) caused by weak supervision signals in fl setting via collaborative annotation calibration (cac) and hierarchical gradient de-conflicting (hgd). to mitigate the local drift, cac customizes a distal peer and a proximal peer for each client via a monte carlo sampling strategy, and then employs inter-client knowledge agreement and disagreement to recognize clean labels and correct noisy labels, respectively. moreover, in order to alleviate the global drift, hgd online builds a client hierarchy under the guidance of history gradient of the global model in each communication round. through de-conflicting clients under the same parent nodes from bottom layers to top layers, hgd achieves robust gradient aggregation at the server side. furthermore, we theoretically analyze feddm and conduct extensive experiments on public datasets. the experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with state-of-the-art approaches. the source code is available at https://github.com/cityu-aim-group/feddm.",AB_0245
"surgical phase recognition is a fundamental task in computer-assisted surgery systems. most existing works are under the supervision of expensive and time-consuming full annotations, which require the surgeons to repeat watching videos to find the precise start and end time for a surgical phase. in this paper, we introduce timestamp supervision for surgical phase recognition to train the models with timestamp annotations, where the surgeons are asked to identify only a single timestamp within the temporal boundary of a phase. this annotation can significantly reduce the manual annotation cost compared to the full annotations. to make full use of such timestamp supervisions, we propose a novel method called uncertainty-aware temporal diffusion (uatd) to generate trustworthy pseudo labels for training. our proposed uatd is motivated by the property of surgical videos, i.e., the phases are long events consisting of consecutive frames. to be specific, uatd diffuses the single labelled timestamp to its corresponding high confident (i.e., low uncertainty) neighbour frames in an iterative way. our study uncovers unique insights of surgical phase recognition with timestamp supervision: 1) timestamp annotation can reduce ${74}\%$ annotation time compared with the full annotation, and surgeons tend to annotate those timestamps near the middle of phases; 2) extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive results compared with full supervision methods, while reducing manual annotation costs; 3) less is more in surgical phase recognition, i.e., less but discriminative pseudo labels outperform full but containing ambiguous frames; 4) the proposed uatd can be used as a plug-and-play method to clean ambiguous labels near boundaries between phases, and improve the performance of the current surgical phase recognition methods. code and annotations obtained from surgeons are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/timestamp-surgical.",AB_0245
"skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopy images is of great significance in the quantitative analysis of skin cancers, which is yet challenging even for dermatologists due to the inherent issues, i.e., considerable size, shape and color variation, and ambiguous boundaries. recent vision transformers have shown promising performance in handling the variation through global context modeling. still, they have not thoroughly solved the problem of ambiguous boundaries as they ignore the complementary usage of the boundary knowledge and global contexts. in this paper, we propose a novel cross-scale boundary-aware transformer, xbound-former, to simultaneously address the variation and boundary problems of skin lesion segmentation. xbound-former is a purely attention-based network and catches boundary knowledge via three specially designed learners. first, we propose an implicit boundary learner (im-bound) to constrain the network attention on the points with noticeable boundary variation, enhancing the local context modeling while maintaining the global context. second, we propose an explicit boundary learner (ex-bound) to extract the boundary knowledge at multiple scales and convert it into embeddings explicitly. third, based on the learned multi-scale boundary embeddings, we propose a cross-scale boundary learner (x-bound) to simultaneously address the problem of ambiguous and multi-scale boundaries by using learned boundary embedding from one scale to guide the boundary-aware attention on the other scales. we evaluate the model on two skin lesion datasets and one polyp lesion dataset, where our model consistently outperforms other convolution- and transformer-based models, especially on the boundary-wise metrics. all resources could be found in https://github.com/jcwang123/xboundformer.",AB_0245
"pancreatic cancer is the emperor of all cancer maladies, mainly because there are no characteristic symptoms in the early stages, resulting in the absence of effective screening and early diagnosis methods in clinical practice. non-contrast computerized tomography (ct) is widely used in routine check-ups and clinical examinations. therefore, based on the accessibility of non-contrast ct, an automated early diagnosismethod for pancreatic cancer is proposed. among this, we develop a novel causalitydriven graph neural network to solve the challenges of stability and generalization of early diagnosis, that is, the proposed method achieves stable performance for datasets from different hospitals, which highlights its clinical significance. specifically, a multiple-instance-learning framework is designed to extract fine-grained pancreatic tumor features. afterwards, to ensure the integrity and stability of the tumor features, we construct an adaptivemetric graph neural network that effectively encodes prior relationships of spatial proximity and feature similarity for multiple instances, and hence adaptively fuses the tumor features. besides, a causal contrastivemechanism is developed to decouple the causality-driven and non-causal components of the discriminative features, suppress the non-causal ones, and hence improve the model stability and generalization. extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed method achieved the promising early diagnosis performance, and its stability and generalizability were independently verified on amulti-center dataset. thus, the proposed method provides a valuable clinical tool for the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. our source codes will be released at https://github.com/sjtubme-qianlab/ cgnn-pc-early-diagnosis.",AB_0245
"whole-slide image (wsi) classification is fundamental to computational pathology, which is challenging in extra-high resolution, expensive manual annotation, data heterogeneity, etc. multiple instance learning (mil) provides a promising way towards wsi classification, which nevertheless suffers from the memory bottleneck issue inherently, due to the gigapixel high resolution. to avoid this issue, the overwhelming majority of existing approaches have to decouple the feature encoder and the mil aggregator in mil networks, which may largely degrade the performance. towards this end, this paper presents a bayesian collaborative learning (bcl) framework to address the memory bottleneck issue with wsi classification. our basic idea is to introduce an auxiliary patch classifier to interact with the target mil classifier to be learned, so that the feature encoder and the mil aggregator in the mil classifier can be learned collaboratively while preventing the memory bottleneck issue. such a collaborative learning procedure is formulated under a unified bayesian probabilistic framework and a principled expectation-maximization algorithm is developed to infer the optimal model parameters iteratively. as an implementation of the e-step, an effective quality-aware pseudo labeling strategy is also suggested. the proposed bcl is extensively evaluated on three publicly available wsi datasets, i.e., camelyon16, tcga-nsclc and tcga-rcc, achieving an auc of 95.6%, 96.0% and 97.5% respectively, which consistently outperforms all the methods compared. comprehensive analysis and discussion will also be presented for in-depth understanding of the method. to promote future work, our source code is released at: https://github.com/zero-we/bcl.",AB_0245
"with the explosive growth of online information, recommender systems play a key role to alleviate such information overload. due to the important application value of recommender systems, there have always been emerging works in this field. in recommender systems, the main challenge is to learn the effective user/item representations from their interactions and side information (if any). recently, graph neural network (gnn) techniques have been widely utilized in recommender systems since most of the information in recommender systems essentially has graph structure and gnn has superiority in graph representation learning. this article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on gnn-based recommender systems. specifically, we provide a taxonomy of gnn-based recommendation models according to the types of information used and recommendation tasks. moreover, we systematically analyze the challenges of applying gnn on different types of data and discuss how existing works in this field address these challenges. furthermore, we state new perspectives pertaining to the development of this field. we collect the representative papers along with their open-source implementations in https://githuh.coni/wusw14/gnn-in-rs.",AB_0245
"enzyme commission (ec) numbers, which associate a protein sequence with the biochemical reactions it catalyzes, are essential for the accurate understanding of enzyme functions and cellular metabolism. many ab initio computational approaches were proposed to predict ec numbers for given input protein sequences. however, the prediction performance (accuracy, recall, and precision), usability, and efficiency of existing methods decreased seriously when dealing with recently discovered proteins, thus still having much room to be improved. here, we report hdmlf, a hierarchical dual-core multitask learning framework for accurately predicting ec numbers based on novel deep learning techniques. hdmlf is composed of an embedding core and a learning core; the embedding core adopts the latest protein language model for protein sequence embedding, and the learning core conducts the ec number prediction. specifically, hdmlf is designed on the basis of a gated recurrent unit framework to perform ec number prediction in the multi-objective hierarchy, multitasking manner. additionally, we introduced an attention layer to optimize the ec prediction and employed a greedy strategy to integrate and fine-tune the final model. comparative analyses against 4 representative methods demonstrate that hdmlf stably delivers the highest performance, which improves accuracy and f1 score by 60% and 40% over the state of the art, respectively. an additional case study of tyrb predicted to compensate for the loss of aspartate aminotransferase aspc, as reported in a previous experimental study, shows that our model can also be used to uncover the enzyme promiscuity. finally, we established a web platform, namely, ecrecer (https://ecrecer.biodesign.ac.cn), using an entirely could-based serverless architecture and provided an offline bundle to improve usability.",AB_0245
"protein is the most important component in organisms and plays an indispensable role in life activities. in recent years, a large number of intelligent methods have been proposed to predict protein function. these methods obtain different types of protein information, including sequence, structure and interaction network. among them, protein sequences have gained significant attention where methods are investigated to extract the information from different views of features. however, how to fully exploit the views for effective protein sequence analysis remains a challenge. in this regard, we propose a multi-view, multi-scale and multi-attention deep neural model (mmsma) for protein function prediction. first, mmsma extracts multi-view features from protein sequences, including one-hot encoding features, evolutionary information features, deep semantic features and overlapping property features based on physiochemistry. second, a specific multi-scale multi-attention deep network model (msma) is built for each view to realize the deep feature learning and preliminary classification. in msma, both multi-scale local patterns and long-range dependence from protein sequences can be captured. third, a multi-view adaptive decision mechanism is developed to make a comprehensive decision based on the classification results of all the views. to further improve the prediction performance, an extended version of mmsma, mmsmaplus, is proposed to integrate homology-based protein prediction under the framework of multi-view deep neural model. experimental results show that the mmsmaplus has promising performance and is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art methods. the source code can be found at https://github.com/wzy-2020/mmsmaplus.",AB_0245
