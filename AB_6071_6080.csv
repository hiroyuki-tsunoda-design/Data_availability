"motivation: gene regulatory networks (grns) in a cell provide the tight feedback needed to synchronize cell actions. however, genes in a cell also take input from, and provide signals to other neighboring cells. these cell-cell interactions (ccis) and the grns deeply influence each other. many computational methods have been developed for grn inference in cells. more recently, methods were proposed to infer ccis using single cell gene expression data with or without cell spatial location information. however, in reality, the two processes do not exist in isolation and are subject to spatial constraints. despite this rationale, no methods currently exist to infer grns and ccis using the same model. results: we propose clarify, a tool that takes grns as input, uses them and spatially resolved gene expression data to infer ccis, while simultaneously outputting refined cell-specific grns. clarify uses a novel multi-level graph autoencoder, which mimics cellular networks at a higher level and cell-specific grns at a deeper level. we applied clarify to two real spatial transcriptomic datasets, one using seqfish and the other using merfish, and also tested on simulated datasets from scmultisim. we compared the quality of predicted grns and ccis with stateof-the-art baseline methods that inferred either only grns or only ccis. the results show that clarify consistently outperforms the baseline in terms of commonly used evaluation metrics. our results point to the importance of co-inference of ccis and grns and to the use of layered graph neural networks as an inference tool for biological networks. availability and implementation: the source code and data is available at https://github.com/mihirbafna/clarify.",AB_0608
"massive sequencing of microbiomes has led to the discovery of a large number of phage genomes with intermittent stop codon recoding. we have developed a computational tool, mgcod, that identifies geno-mic regions (blocks) with distinct stop codon recoding simultaneously with the prediction of protein-coding regions. when mgcod was used to scan a large volume of human metagenomic contigs hundreds of viral contigs with intermittent stop codon recoding were revealed. many of these contigs originated from gen-omes of known crassphages. further analyses had shown that intermittent recoding was associated with subtle patterns in the organization of protein-coding genes, such as 'single-coding' and 'dual-coding'. the dual-coding genes, clustered into blocks, could be translated by two alternative codes producing nearly identical proteins. it was observed that the dual-coded blocks were enriched with the early-stage phage genes, while the late-stage genes were residing in the single-coded blocks. mgcod can identify types of stop codon recoding in novel genomic sequences in parallel with gene prediction. it is available for download from https://github.com/gatech-genemark/mgcod.

"the remarkable recent advances in protein structure prediction have enabled computational modeling of protein structures with considerably higher accuracy than ever before. while state-of-the-art structure pre-diction methods provide self-assessment confidence scores of their own predictions, an independent and open-access system for protein scoring is still needed that can be applied to a broad range of predictive modeling scenarios. here, we present iqdeep, an integrated and highly customizable web server for pro-tein scoring, freely available at http://fusion.cs.vt.edu/iqdeep. the underlying method of iqdeep employs multiscale deep residual neural networks (resnets) to perform residue-level error classifications, and then probabilistically combines the error classifications for protein scoring. by adjusting the error resolu-tions, our method can reliably estimate the standard-or high-accuracy variants of the global distance test metric for versatile protein scoring. the performance of the method has been extensively tested and compared against the state-of-the-art approaches in multiple rounds of critical assessment of tech-niques for protein structure prediction (casp) experiments including benchmark assessment in casp12 and casp13 as well as blind evaluation in casp14. the iqdeep web server offers a number of conve-nient features, including (i) the choice of individual and batch processing modes; (ii) an interactive and privacy-preserving web interface for automated job submission, tracking, and results retrieval; (iii) web -based quantitative and visual analyses of the results including overall estimated score and its residue -wise breakdown along with agreements between various sequence-and structural-level features; (iv) extensive help information on job submission and results interpretation via web-based tutorial and help tooltips.& copy; 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0608
"molecular modeling and simulation play important roles in biomedical research as they provide molecularlevel insight into the underlying mechanisms of biological functions that are difficult to elucidate only with experiments. charmm-gui (https://charmm-gui.org) is a web-based cyberinfrastructure that is widely used to generate various molecular simulation system and input files and thus facilitates and standardizes the usage of common and advanced simulation techniques. in particular, pdb manipulator provides various chemical modification options as the starting point for most input generation modules in charmmgui. here, we discuss recent additions to pdb manipulator, such as non-standard amino acids/rna substitutions, ubiquitylation and sumoylation, lys/arg post-translational modifications, lipidation, peptide stapling, and improved parameterization options of small molecules. these additional features are expected to make complex pdb modifications easy for biomolecular modeling and simulation. & copy; 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0608

"the multiple sequence alignment (msa) is the entry point of many rna structure modeling tasks, such as prediction of rna secondary structure (rss) and contacts. however, there are few automated programs for generating high quality msas of target rna molecules. we have developed rmsa, a hierarchical pipeline for sensitive search and accurate alignment of rna homologs for a target rna. on a diverse set of 365 non-redundant rna structures, rmsa significantly outperforms an existing msa generation method (rnacmap) by approximately 20% and 5% higher f1-scores for rss and long-range contact prediction, respectively. rmsa is available at https://zhanggroup.org/rmsa/ and https://github.com/pylelab/rmsa.(c) 2022 the authors. published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0608
"we present an updated version of the predicting protein-protein interactions (preppi) webserver which predicts ppis on a proteome-wide scale. preppi combines structural and non-structural evidence within a bayesian framework to compute a likelihood ratio (lr) for essentially every possible pair of proteins in a proteome; the current database is for the human interactome. the structural modeling (sm) component is derived from template-based modeling and its application on a proteome-wide scale is enabled by a unique scoring function used to evaluate a putative complex. the updated version of preppi leverages alphafold structures that are parsed into individual domains. as has been demonstrated in earlier applications, preppi performs extremely well as measured by receiver operating characteristic curves derived from testing on e. coli and human protein-protein interaction (ppi) databases. a preppi database of -1.3 million human ppis can be queried with a webserver application that comprises multiple functionalities for examining query proteins, template complexes, 3d models for predicted complexes, and related features (https://honiglab.c2b2.columbia.edu/preppi). preppi is a state-of-the-art resource that offers an unprecedented structure-informed view of the human interactome.

"indecipherable black boxes are common in machine learning (ml), but applications increasingly require explainable artificial intelligence (xai). the core of xai is to establish transparent and interpretable data-driven algorithms. this work provides concrete tools for xai in situations where prior knowledge must be encoded and untrustworthy inferences flagged. we use the learn to optimize (l2o) methodology wherein each inference solves a data-driven optimization problem. our l2o models are straightforward to implement, directly encode prior knowledge, and yield theoretical guarantees (e.g. satisfaction of constraints). we also propose use of interpretable certificates to verify whether model inferences are trustworthy. numerical examples are provided in the applications of dictionary-based signal recovery, ct imaging, and arbitrage trading of cryptoassets. code and additional documentation can be found at https://xai-l2o.research.typal.academy.",AB_0608
"the folding patterns of interphase genomes in higher eukaryotes, as obtained from dna-proximity-ligation or hi-c experiments, are used to classify loci into structural classes called compartments and subcompartments. these structurally annotated (sub) compartments are known to exhibit specific epigenomic characteristics and cell-type-specific variations. to explore the relationship between genome structure and the epigenome, we present pymegabase (pymb), a maximum-entropy-based neural network model that predicts (sub) compartment annotations of a locus based solely on the local epigenome, such as chip-seq of histone post-translational modifications. pymb builds upon our previous model while improving robustness, capability to handle diverse inputs and user-friendly implementation. we employed pymb to predict subcompartments for over a hundred human cell types available in encode, shedding light on the links between subcompartments, cell identity, and epigenomic signals. the fact that pymb, trained on data for human cells, can accurately predict compartments in mice suggests that the model is learning underlying physicochemical principles transferable across cell types and species. reliable at higher resolutions (up to 5 kbp), pymb is used to investigate compartment-specific gene expression. not only can pymb generate (sub) compartment information without hi-c experiments, but its predictions are also interpretable. analyzing pymb's trained parameters, we explore the importance of various epigenomic marks in each subcompartment prediction. furthermore, the predictions of the model can be used as input for openmichrom software, which has been calibrated to generate three-dimensional structures of the genome. detailed documentation of pymb is available at https://pymegabase.readthedocs.io, including an installation guide using pip or conda, and jupyter/colab notebook tutorials.& copy; 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0608
