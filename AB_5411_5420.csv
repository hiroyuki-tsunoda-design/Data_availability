"global change caused by human activity (e.g., land fragmentation, deforestation, pollution, anthropization of natural landscapes) has several effects on the biomes of the earth, leading to alterations in the functioning of ecological systems. in this context, remote sensing represents an important tool to assess ecosystem changes, as it allows to collect a huge amount of data at different temporal and spatial resolutions concerning various com-partments of the earth system (land, ocean, atmosphere, and cryosphere). this information can be used to es-timate precipitation patterns, global temperatures, snow cover and aerosol concentrations. the aim of this work is to exploit this wide availability of data to display the ecosystem changes using a new visualization method: the helical graphs. the helical graphs represent the change of a variable over time, reporting on the y-axis its moving averages and on the x-axis its rates of change.these new charts were tested on the ndvi index retrieved from google earth engine (https://earthengine.goo gle.com/) to visualize trends on selected biomes of the earth (tropical and boreal forests). the results show that the helical graphs are a useful tool to highlight trends that might not be easily detected in a time series. in conclusion, the helical graphs can have a lot of application in ecology, especially exploiting the wide amount of data available thanks to the remote sensing.",AB_0542
"background: machine learning (ml) has gained significant attention for classifying immune states in adaptive immune receptor repertoires (airrs) to support the advancement of immunodiagnostics and therapeutics. simulated data are crucial for the rigorous benchmarking of airr-ml methods. existing approaches to generating synthetic benchmarking datasets result in the generation of naive repertoires missing the key feature of many shared receptor sequences (selected for common antigens) found in antigenexperienced repertoires. results: we demonstrate that a common approach to generating simulated airr benchmark datasets can introduce biases, which may be exploited for undesired shortcut learning by certain ml methods. to mitigate undesirable access to true signals in simulated airr datasets, we devised a simulation strategy (simairr) that constructs antigen-experienced-like repertoires with a realistic overlap of receptor sequences. simairr can be used for constructing airr-level benchmarks based on a range of assumptions (or experimental data sources) for what constitutes receptor-level immune signals. this includes the possibility of making or not making any prior assumptions regarding the similarity or commonality of immune state-associated sequences that will be used as true signals. we demonstrate the real-world realism of our proposed simulation approach by showing that basic ml strategies perform similarly on simairr-generated and real-world experimental airr datasets. conclusions: this study sheds light on the potential shortcut learning opportunities for ml methods that can arise with the stateof-the-art way of simulating airr datasets. simairr is available as a python package: https://github.com/kanduric/simairr.",AB_0542
"the computer-aided diagnosis (cad) of skin diseases relies heavily on automated skin lesion segmentation, albeit presenting considerable challenges due to lesion diversity in shape, size, color, and texture, as well as potential blurry boundaries with surrounding tissues. traditional convolutional neural networks (cnn) typically underperform in this domain, given their inherent constraints in global context information capture. in the present study, we present a new u-shaped network, dual-encoder u-net (deu-net), which is based on an encoder-decoder architecture. deu-net integrates a dual-encoder branch comprising a convolutional encoder and a transformer encoder, thereby facilitating the concurrent extraction of local features and global contextual information. additionally, in order to enhance the performance of deu-net, we employ an integrated test-time augmentation technique. to ascertain the efficiency and superiority of our proposed methodology, we performed comprehensive experiments across four widely accessible skin lesion datasets, namely isic 2016, isic 2017, isic 2018, and ph2. the dice coefficients achieved on these datasets were 92.90%, 87.16%, 90.81%, and 95.65%, respectively. these results demonstrate superior performance compared to most current state-of-the-art methods. the source code is released at https://github.com/alikm6/deu-net.",AB_0542
"low-level mosaic epimutations within the brca1 gene promoter occur in 5-8% of healthy individuals and are associated with a significantly elevated risk of breast and ovarian cancer. similar events may also affect other tumor suppressor genes, potentially being a significant contributor to cancer burden. while this opens a new area for translational research, detection of low-level mosaic epigenetic events requires highly sensitive and robust methodology for methylation analysis. we here present epialleler, a computational framework for sensitive detection, quantification, and visualization of mosaic epimutations in methylation sequencing data. analyzing simulated and real data sets, we provide in-depth assessments of epialleler performance and show that linkage to epihaplotype data is necessary to detect low-level methylation events. the epialleler is freely available at https://github.com/bbcg/epialleler and https://bioconductor.org/packages/epialleler/ as an open-source r/bioconductor package.",AB_0542
"accurate estimation of the remaining useful life (rul) of lithium-ion batteries is critical for their large-scale deployment as energy storage devices in electric vehicles and stationary storage. a fundamental understanding of the factors affecting rul is crucial for accelerating battery technology development. however, it is very challenging to predict rul accurately because of complex degradation mechanisms occurring within the batteries, as well as dynamic operating conditions in practical applications. moreover, due to insignificant capacity degradation in early stages, early prediction of battery life with early cycle data can be more difficult. in this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning model for early prediction of battery rul. the proposed method can effectively combine handcrafted features with domain knowledge and latent features learned by deep networks to boost the performance of rul early prediction. we also design a non-linear correlation-based method to select effective domain knowledge-based features. moreover, a novel snapshot ensemble learning strategy is proposed to further enhance model generalization ability without increasing any additional training cost. our experimental results show that the proposed method not only outperforms other approaches in the primary test set having a similar distribution as the training set, but also generalizes well to the secondary test set having a clearly different distribution with the training set. the pytorch implementation of our proposed approach is available at https://github.com/batteryrullbattery_rul_early_prediction.",AB_0542
"face manipulation attacks have drawn the attention of biometric researchers because of their vulnerability to face recognition systems (frs). this paper proposes a novel scheme to generate composite face image attacks (cfia) based on facial attributes using generative adversarial networks (gans). given the face images corresponding to two unique data subjects, the proposed cfia method will independently generate the segmented facial attributes, then blend them using transparent masks to generate the cfia samples. we generate 526 unique cfia combinations of facial attributes for each pair of contributory data subjects. extensive experiments are carried out on our newly generated cfia dataset consisting of 1000 unique identities with 2000 bona fide samples and 526000 cfia samples, thus resulting in an overall 528000 face image samples. we present a sequence of experiments to benchmark the attack potential of cfia samples using four different automatic frs. we introduced a new metric named generalized morphing attack potential (g-map) to benchmark the vulnerability of generated attacks on frs effectively. additional experiments are performed on the representative subset of the cfia dataset to benchmark both perceptual quality and human observer response. finally, the cfia detection performance is benchmarked using three different single image based face morphing attack detection (mad) algorithms. the source code of the proposed method together with cfia dataset will be made publicly available: https://github.com/jagmohaniiit/latentcompositioncode",AB_0542
"multimodal sequence learning aims to utilize information from different modalities to enhance overall performance. mainstream works often follow an intermediate-fusion pipeline, which explores both modality-specific and modality-supplementary information for fusion. however, the unaligned and heterogeneously distributed multimodal sequences pose significant challenges to the fusion task: 1) to extract both effective unimodal and crossmodal representations and 2) to overcome the overfitting issue in joint multimodal sequence optimization. in this work, we propose regularized expressive representation distillation (rerd) that aims to seek effective multimodal representations and to enhance the generalization of fusion. first, to improve unimodal representation learning, unimodal representations are assigned to multi-head distillation encoders, where the unimodal representations are iteratively updated through distillation attention layers. second, to alleviate the overfitting issue in joint crossmodal optimization, a multimodal sinkhorn distance regularizer is proposed to reinforce the expressive representation extraction and to reduce the modality gap before fusion adaptively. these representations produce a comprehensive view of the multimodal sequences, which are utilized for downstream fusion tasks. experimental results on several popular benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, compared with widely used baselines for deep multimodal sequence fusion, as shown in https://github.com/redaimao/rerd.",AB_0542
"thelearning process of deep learning methods usually updates the model's parameters in multiple iterations. each iteration can be viewed as the first-order approximation of taylor's series expansion. the remainder, which consists of higher-order terms, is usually ignored in the learning process for simplicity. this learning scheme empowers various multimedia-based applications, such as image retrieval, recommendation system, and video search. generally, multimedia data (e.g. images) are semantics-rich and high-dimensional, hence the remainders of approximations are possibly non-zero. in this work, we consider that the remainder is informative and study how it affects the learning process. to this end, we propose a new learning approach, namely gradient adjustment learning (gal), to leverage the knowledge learned from the past training iterations to adjust vanilla gradients, such that the remainders are minimized and the approximations are improved. the proposed gal is model- and optimizer-agnostic, and is easy to adapt to the standard learning framework. it is evaluated on three tasks, i.e. image classification, object detection, and regression, with state-of-the-art models and optimizers. the experiments show that the proposed gal consistently enhances the evaluated models, whereas the ablation studies validate various aspects of the proposed gal. the code is available at https://github.com/luoyan407/gradient_adjustment.git.",AB_0542
"surface mount technology (smt) is a procedure for mounting electronic components to the surface of printed circuit boards (pcbs). although the smt procedure is more reliable than the conventional through-hole mounting, many errors may occur in smt lines. in this article, we surveyed methods presented for the optical inspection of solder joints on pcbs. the methods are grouped by problem-solving approach: reference-based, machine learning/computer vision, deep learning, and 3-d reconstruction. we compare and discuss these approaches according to their advantages and disadvantages, with a focus on the more recent deep learning and 3-d reconstruction techniques, and list the public datasets for solder joint inspection. since defective samples rarely occur in the smt manufacturing lines, public datasets have few defective samples that are essential for the inspection task. to fill this gap, we publish a public dataset with both normal and different types of smt errors. our dataset can be used as a benchmark to compare different algorithms. the dataset is available at https://github.com/furkanulger/solder-joint-dataset.",AB_0542
"incorporating deep-learning (dl) classification models into unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) can significantly augment search-and-rescue operations and disaster management efforts. in such critical situations, the uav's ability to promptly comprehend the crisis and optimally utilize its limited power and processing resources to narrow down search areas is crucial. therefore, developing an efficient and lightweight method for scene classification is of utmost importance. however, current approaches tend to prioritize accuracy on benchmark datasets at the expense of computational efficiency. to address this shortcoming, we introduce the wider attention efficientnet (watt-effnet), a novel method that achieves higher accuracy with a more lightweight architecture compared to the baseline efficientnet. the watt-effnet leverages width-wise incremental feature modules and attention mechanisms over width-wise features to ensure the network structure remains lightweight. we evaluate our method on a uav-based aerial disaster image classification dataset and demonstrate that it outperforms the baseline by up to 10.6% in terms of classification accuracy and 38.3% in terms of computing efficiency as measured by floating-point operations per second (flops). additionally, we conduct an ablation study to investigate the effect of varying the width of watt-effnet on accuracy and computational efficiency. our code is available at https://github.com/tanmdl/watt-effnet.",AB_0542
