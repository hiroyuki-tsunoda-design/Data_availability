"interleukin-5 (il-5) can act as an enticing therapeutic target due to its pivotal role in several eosinophil-mediated diseases. the aim of this study is to develop a model for predicting il-5 inducing antigenic regions in a protein with high precision. all models in this study have been trained, tested and validated on experimentally validated 1907 il-5 inducing and 7759 non-il-5 inducing peptides obtained from iedb. our primary analysis indicates that il-5 inducing peptides are dominated by certain residues like ile, asn, and tyr. it was also observed that binders of a wide range of hla alleles can induce il-5. initially, alignment-based methods have been developed using similarity and motif search. these alignment-based methods provide high precision but poor coverage. in order to overcome this limitation, we explore alignment-free methods which are mainly machine learning-based models. firstly, models have been developed using binary profiles and extreme gradient boosting-based model achieved a maximum auc of 0.59. secondly, composition-based models have been developed and our dipeptide-based random forest model achieved a maximum auc of 0.74. thirdly, random forest model devel-oped using selected 250 dipeptides and achieved auc 0.75 and mcc 0.29 on validation dataset; best among alignment-free models. in order to improve the performance, we developed an ensemble or hybrid method that combined alignment-based and alignment-free methods. our hybrid method achieved auc 0.94 with mcc 0.60 on a validation/independent dataset. the best hybrid model developed in this study has been incorporated into the user-friendly web server and a standalone package named 'il5pred' (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava /il5pred/).",AB_0520
"supervised deep learning-based methods yield accurate results for medical image segmentation. however, they require large labeled datasets for this, and obtaining them is a laborious task that requires clinical expertise. semi/self-supervised learning-based approaches address this limitation by exploiting unlabeled data along with limited annotated data. recent self-supervised learning methods use contrastive loss to learn good global level representations from unlabeled images and achieve high performance in classification tasks on popular natural image datasets like imagenet. in pixel-level prediction tasks such as segmentation, it is crucial to also learn good local level representations along with global representations to achieve better accuracy. however, the impact of the existing local contrastive loss-based methods remains limited for learning good local representations because similar and dissimilar local regions are defined based on random augmentations and spatial proximity; not based on the semantic label of local regions due to lack of large-scale expert annotations in the semi/self-supervised setting. in this paper, we propose a local contrastive loss to learn good pixel level features useful for segmentation by exploiting semantic label information obtained from pseudo-labels of unlabeled images alongside limited annotated images with ground truth (gt) labels. in particular, we define the proposed contrastive loss to encourage similar representations for the pixels that have the same pseudo-label/gt label while being dissimilar to the representation of pixels with different pseudo-label/gt label in the dataset. we perform pseudo-label based self-training and train the network by jointly optimizing the proposed contrastive loss on both labeled and unlabeled sets and segmentation loss on only the limited labeled set. we evaluated the proposed approach on three public medical datasets of cardiac and prostate anatomies, and obtain high segmentation performance with a limited labeled set of one or two 3d volumes. extensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art semi-supervised and data augmentation methods and concurrent contrastive learning methods demonstrate the substantial improvement achieved by the proposed method. the code is made publicly available at https://github.com/krishnabits001/pseudo_label_contrastive_ training.",AB_0520
"sars-cov-2 has significantly mutated its genome during the past 3 years, leading to the periodic emergence of several variants. some of the variants possess enhanced fitness advantage, transmissibility, and pathogenicity and can also reduce vaccine efficacy. thus, it is important to track the viral evolution to prevent and protect the mankind from sars-cov-2 infection. to this end, an interactive web-gui platform, namely, cove-tracker (sars-cov-2 evolution tracker), is developed to track its pan proteome evolutionary dynamics (https://project.iith.ac.in/cove-tracker/). cove-tracker provides an opportunity for the user to fetch the country-wise and protein-wise amino acid mutations (currently, 44139) of sars-cov-2 and their month-wise distribution. it also provides position-wise evolution observed in the sars-cov-2 proteome. importantly, cove-tracker provides month-and country-wise distributions of 2065 phylogenetic assignment of named global outbreak (pango) lineages and their 177564 variants. it further provides periodic updates on sarscov-2 variant(s) evolution. cove-tracker provides the results in a user-friendly interactive fashion by projecting the results onto the world map (for country-wise distribution) and protein 3d structure (for protein-wise mutation). the application of cove-tracker in tracking the closest cousin(s) of a variant is demonstrated by considering ba.4 and ba.5 pango lineages as test cases. thus, cove-tracker would be useful in the quick surveillance of newly emerging mutations/ variants/lineages to facilitate the understanding of viral evolution, transmission, and disease epidemiology.",AB_0520
"acute myeloid leukemia (aml) can be detected based on morphology, cytochemistry, immunological markers, and cytogenetics. micrornas (mirnas) influence key biological pathways in multiple haematological malig-nancies including aml. in this work, we have analysed the mirnome and the transcriptome of normal and aml samples and have identified the significant set of mirna-target mrna pairs present within aml-peripheral blood and aml-bone marrow samples from both tissue and cell lines. the mirna target genes are further filtered based on their functional significance in aml system. these filtered genes constitute the set of selected mirna target features, which have been finally used for developing machine learning based prediction tool, 'tbamlpred' for preliminary detection of aml. this model implements both unsupervised clustering and supervised classification algorithms that would in-crease the reliability of prediction. our results show that the selected mirna target-based features can separate the control and disease samples linearly. overall, we put forward 'tbamlpred' for a non-invasive mode of preliminary aml diagnosis in future. github link for accessing tbamlpred: https://github.com/zglabdib/tbamlpred",AB_0520
"we have recently been witnessing that our society is starting to heal from the impacts of covid-19. the economic, social and cultural impacts of a pandemic cannot be ignored and we should be properly equipped to deal with similar situations in future. recently, monkeypox has been concerning the international health community with its lethal impacts for a probable pandemic. in such situations, having appropriate protocols and methodologies to deal with the outbreak efficiently is of paramount interest to the world. early diagnosis and treatment stand as the only viable option to tackle such problems. to this end, in this paper, we propose an ensemble learning-based framework to detect the presence of the monkeypox virus from skin lesion images. we first consider three pre-trained base learners, namely inception v3, xception and densenet169 to fine-tune on a target monkeypox dataset. further, we extract probabilities from these deep models to feed into the ensemble framework. to combine the outcomes, we propose a beta function-based normalization scheme of probabilities to learn an efficient aggregation of complementary information obtained from the base learners followed by the sum rule-based ensemble. the framework is extensively evaluated on a publicly available monkeypox skin lesion dataset using a five-fold cross-validation setup to evaluate its effectiveness. the model achieves an average of 93.39%, 88.91%, 96.78% and 92.35% accuracy, precision, recall and f1 scores, respectively. the supporting source codes are presented in https://github.com/bihanbanerjee/monkeypox",AB_0520
"ectopic pregnancy (ep) is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality, where the fertilized embryo grows outside of the uterus. recent experiments on mice have uncovered the importance of genetic factors in the transport of embryos inside the uterus. in the past, efforts have been made to identify possible gene or protein markers in ep in humans through multiple expression studies. although there exist comprehensive gene re-sources for other maternal health disorders, there is no specific resource that compiles the genes associated with ep from such expression studies. here, we address that knowledge gap by creating a computational resource, ectopic pregnancy expression knowledgebase (epek), that involves manual compilation and curation of expression profiles of ep in humans from published articles. in epek, we compiled information on 314 differ-entially expressed genes, 17 metabolites, and 3 snps associated with ep. computational analyses on the gene set from epek showed the implication of cellular signaling processes in ep. we also identified possible exosome markers that could be clinically relevant in the diagnosis of ep. in a nutshell, epek is the first and only dedicated resource on the expression profile of ep in humans. epek is accessible at https://cb.imsc.res.in/epek.",AB_0520
"purpose - the purpose of this paper is to determine the relationship between the access mode of research articles [open access (oa) and toll-access (ta)] and their subsequent citation counts in biological and physical sciences in three impact factor zones (high, medium and low).design/methodology/approach- three subjects each from biological sciences (biochemistry, cell biology and genetics) and physical sciences (astronomy, oceanography and optics) were selected for the study. a comprehensive list of journals (ta and oa) in select subjects of biological and physical sciences was prepared by consulting journal citation report's master journal list (for the compilation of both open access and toll access journal list) and directory of open access journals (for the compilation of open access journal list). for each journal, essential details like content language, format, year of publication, access mode (open access or toll access), etc. were obtained from ulrich's periodical directory. web of science (wos) was used as citations indexing tool in this study. the data set was run on the wos to collect the citation data.findings - the results of the study indicate that open mode of access is not a prerequisite for higher citation boost as in the majority of the cases in this study, ta articles have garnered a greater number of citations as compared to open access articles in different impact factor zones in biological and physical sciences.originality/value - a novel approach has been adopted to understand and compare the research impact of open access (oa) and toll access (ta) journal articles in the field of biological and physical sciences at three impact factor zone levels to reveal the citation metrics encompassing three parameters, i.e. citedness, average citation count and year wise distribution of citations in select subjects of biological and physical sciences.peer review - the peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/[doi]/10. 1108/oir-01-2021-0029",AB_0520
"in recent times, microarray gene expression datasets have gained significant popularity due to their usefulness to identify different types of cancer directly through bio-markers. these datasets possess a high gene-to-sample ratio and high dimensionality, with only a few genes functioning as bio-markers. consequently, a significant amount of data is redundant, and it is essential to filter out important genes carefully. in this paper, we propose the simulated annealing aided genetic algorithm (saga), a meta-heuristic approach to identify informative genes from high-dimensional datasets. saga utilizes a two-way mutation-based simulated annealing (sa) as well as genetic algorithm (ga) to ensure a good trade-off between exploitation and exploration of the search space, respectively. the naive version of ga often gets stuck in a local optimum and depends on the initial population, leading to premature convergence. to address this, we have blended a clustering-based population generation with sa to distribute the initial population of ga over the entire feature space. to further enhance the performance, we reduce the initial search space by a score-based filter approach called the mutually informed correlation coefficient (micc). the proposed method is evaluated on 6 microarray and 6 omics datasets. comparison of saga with contemporary algorithms has shown that saga performs much better than its peers. our code is available at https://github.com/shyammarjit/saga.",AB_0520
"in a topology optimization (to) setting, design-dependent fluidic pressure loads pose several challenges as their direction, magnitude, and location alter with topology evolution. this paper offers a compact 100-line matlab code, topress, for to of structures subjected to fluidic pressure loads using the method of moving asymptotes. the code is intended for pedagogical purposes and aims to ease the beginners' and students' learning toward the to with design-dependent fluidic pressure loads. topress is developed per the approach first reported in kumar et al. (struct multidisc optim 61(4):1637-1655, 2020). the darcy law, in conjunction with the drainage term, is used to model the applied pressure load. the consistent nodal loads are determined from the obtained pressure field. the employed approach facilitates inexpensive computation of the load sensitivities using the adjoint-variable method. compliance minimization subject to volume constraint optimization problems is solved. the success and efficacy of the code are demonstrated by solving benchmark numerical examples involving pressure loads, wherein the importance of load sensitivities is also demonstrated. topress contains six main parts, is described in detail, and is extended to solve different problems. steps to include a projection filter are provided to achieve loadbearing designs close to 0-1. the code is provided in appendix 2 and can also be downloaded along with its extensions from https://github.com/prabhatin/topress.",AB_0520
"background the increasing amount of chemical reaction data makes traditional ways to navigate its corpus less effective, while the demand for novel approaches and instruments is rising. recent data science and machine learning techniques support the development of new ways to extract value from the available reaction data. on the one side, computer-aided synthesis planning tools can predict synthetic routes in a model-driven approach; on the other side, experimental routes can be extracted from the network of organic chemistry, in which reaction data are linked in a network. in this context, the need to combine, compare and analyze synthetic routes generated by different sources arises naturally.results here we present linchemin, a python toolkit that allows chemoinformatics operations on synthetic routes and reaction networks. wrapping some third-party packages for handling graph arithmetic and chemoinformatics and implementing new data models and functionalities, linchemin allows the interconversion between data formats and data models and enables route-level analysis and operations, including route comparison and descriptors calculation. object-oriented design principles inspire the software architecture, and the modules are structured to maximize code reusability and support code testing and refactoring. the code structure should facilitate external contributions, thus encouraging open and collaborative software development.conclusions the current version of linchemin allows users to combine synthetic routes generated from various tools and analyze them, and constitutes an open and extensible framework capable of incorporating contributions from the community and fostering scientific discussion. our roadmap envisages the development of sophisticated metrics for routes evaluation, a multi-parameter scoring system, and the implementation of an entire ecosystem of functionalities operating on synthetic routes. linchemin is freely available at https://github.com/syngenta/linchemin.",AB_0520
