"motivation detecting oscillations in time series remains a challenging problem even after decades of research. in chronobiology, rhythms (for instance in gene expression, eclosion, egg-laying, and feeding) tend to be low amplitude, display large variations amongst replicates, and often exhibit varying peak-to-peak distances (non-stationarity). most currently available rhythm detection methods are not specifically designed to handle such datasets, and are also limited by their use of p-values in detecting oscillations.results we introduce a new method, odegp (oscillation detection using gaussian processes), which combines gaussian process regression and bayesian inference to incorporate measurement errors, non-uniformly sampled data, and a recently developed non-stationary kernel to improve detection of oscillations. by using bayes factors, odegp models both the null (non-rhythmic) and the alternative (rhythmic) hypotheses, thus providing an advantage over p-values. using synthetic datasets, we first demonstrate that odegp almost always outperforms eight commonly used methods in detecting stationary as well as non-stationary symmetric oscillations. next, by analyzing existing qpcr datasets, we demonstrate that our method is more sensitive compared to the existing methods at detecting weak and noisy oscillations. finally, we generate new qpcr data on mouse embryonic stem cells. surprisingly, we discover using odegp that increasing cell-density results in rapid generation of oscillations in the bmal1 gene, thus highlighting our method's ability to discover unexpected and new patterns. in its current implementation, odegp is meant only for analyzing single or a few time-trajectories, not genome-wide datasets.availability and implementation odegp is available at https://github.com/shaonlab/odegp.",AB_0509
"background psychosocial risk factors in the home may impair children's health and development and increase the risk of maltreatment. the safe environment for every kid (seek) model was developed to provide pediatric primary care professionals with a structured way to identify common psychosocial problems. the seek model includes use of the parent screening questionnaire (seek-psq) at routine preventive child health visits, discussion with parents about their responses and, when indicated, referral to relevant services. the seek-psq has not previously been available in swedish. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of an adapted swedish version of the seek-psq (psq-s). methodsthis study is part of a cluster-randomised controlled trial of seek in the swedish child health services. to validate the psq-s, parents (n=852) with children 0-18 months of age were invited to complete a survey including the psq-s as well as evidence-based standardized instruments for the targeted psychosocial risk factors: economic worries, depressive symptoms, parental stress, alcohol misuse and intimate partner violence (ipv). baseline data from 611 (72%) parents were analysed regarding sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv) and negative predictive value (npv) for each risk factor. results as a whole, the psq-s had a sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 52%, ppv of 67% and npv of 87%. for mothers and fathers combined, sensitivity was 80% for economic worries, 89% for depressive symptoms, 78% for parental stress, 47% for intimate partner violence (ipv) and 70% for alcohol misuse. specificity was highest for ipv and alcohol misuse (91%) and lowest for depressive symptoms (64%). npv values were high (81-99%) and ppv values were low to moderate (22-69%) for the targeted problems. sensitivity was higher for mothers compared to fathers for economic worries, depressive symptoms and ipv. this difference was particularly evident for ipv (52% for mothers, 27% for fathers). conclusion the seek-psq-s demonstrated good psychometric properties for identifying economic worries, depressive symptoms, parental stress and alcohol misuse but low sensitivity for ipv. the psq-s as a whole showed high sensitivity and npv, indicating that most parents with or without the targeted psychosocial risk factors were correctly identified.trial registrationisrctn registry, study record 14,429,952 (https://doi.org/10.1186/isrctn14429952) registration date 27/05/2020.",AB_0509
"multiplexed imaging enables the simultaneous spatial profiling of dozens of biological molecules in tissues at single-cell resolution. extracting biologically relevant information, such as the spatial distribution of cell phenotypes from multiplexed tissue imaging data, involves a number of computational tasks, including image segmentation, feature extraction and spatially resolved single-cell analysis. here, we present an end-to-end workflow for multiplexed tissue image processing and analysis that integrates previously developed computational tools to enable these tasks in a user-friendly and customizable fashion. for data quality assessment, we highlight the utility of napari-imc for interactively inspecting raw imaging data and the cytomapper r/bioconductor package for image visualization in r. raw data preprocessing, image segmentation and feature extraction are performed using the steinbock toolkit. we showcase two alternative approaches for segmenting cells on the basis of supervised pixel classification and pretrained deep learning models. the extracted single-cell data are then read, processed and analyzed in r. the protocol describes the use of community-established data containers, facilitating the application of r/bioconductor packages for dimensionality reduction, single-cell visualization and phenotyping. we provide instructions for performing spatially resolved single-cell analysis, including community analysis, cellular neighborhood detection and cell-cell interaction testing using the imcrtools r/bioconductor package. the workflow has been previously applied to imaging mass cytometry data, but can be easily adapted to other highly multiplexed imaging technologies. this protocol can be implemented by researchers with basic bioinformatics training, and the analysis of the provided dataset can be completed within 5-6 h. an extended version is available at https://bodenmillergroup.github.io/imcdataanalysis/. the protocol describes the analysis of data generated by highly multiplexed tissue imaging approaches, such as imaging mass cytometry. the presented workflow includes steps for imaging data visualization, data preprocessing, image segmentation, single-cell feature extraction, reading data into r, spillover correction, quality control, cell phenotyping and spatially resolved single-cell analysis.the software packages used include napari, steinbock, deepcell/mesmer, ilastik, cellprofiler, cytomapper and imcrtools. an integrated workflow for multiplexed tissue image processing and analysis, including interactive inspection of raw data, cell segmentation, feature extraction, single-cell analysis and spatial analysis.",AB_0509
"in this study, we introduce beorn (bubbles during the epoch of reionization numerical simulator), a publicly available python code that generates three-dimensional maps of the 21-cm signal from the cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization. built upon n-body simulation outputs, beorn populates haloes with stars and galaxies based on a flexible source model. it then computes the evolution of ly alpha coupling, temperature, and ionization profiles as a function of source properties, and paints these profiles around each source on to a three-dimensional grid. the code consistently deals with the overlap of ionized bubbles by redistributing photons around the bubble boundaries, thereby ensuring photon conservation. it accounts for the redshifting of photons and the source look-back effect for the temperature and ly alpha coupling profiles that extend far into the intergalactic medium to scales of order 100 cmpc. we provide a detailed description of the code and compare it to results from the literature. after validation, we run three different benchmark models based on a cosmological n-body simulation. all three models agree with current observations from ultravoilet luminosity functions and estimates of the mean ionization fraction. due to different assumptions regarding the small-mass stellar-to-halo relation, the x-ray flux emission, and the ionizing photon escape fraction, the models produce unique signatures ranging from a cold reionization with deep absorption trough to an emission-dominated 21-cm signal, broadly encompassing the current uncertainties at cosmic dawn. the code beorn is publicly available at https://github.com/cosmic-reionization/beorn.",AB_0509
"the lateral organ boundaries domain (lbd) containing genes are a set of plant-specific transcription factors and are crucial for controlling both organ development and defense mechanisms as well as anthocyanin synthesis and nitrogen metabolism. it is imperative to understand how methylation regulates gene expression, through predicting methylation sites of their promoters particularly in major crop species. in this study, we developed a user-friendly prediction server for accurate prediction of 6ma sites by incorporating a robust feature set, viz., binary encoding of mono-nucleotide dna. our model,methsemble-6ma, outperformed other state-of-the-art tools in terms of accuracy (93.12%). furthermore, we investigated the pattern of probable 6ma sites at the upstream promoter regions of the lbd-containing genes in triticum aestivum and its allied species using the developed tool. on average, each selected species had four 6ma sites, and it was found that with speciation and due course of evolution in wheat, the frequency of methylation have reduced, and a few sites remain conserved. this obviously cues gene birth and gene expression alteration through methylation over time in a species and reflects functional conservation throughout evolution. since dna methylation is a vital event in almost all plant developmental processes (e.g., genomic imprinting and gametogenesis) along with other life processes, our findings on epigenetic regulation of lbd-containing genes have dynamic implications in basic and applied research. additionally, methsemble-6ma (http://cabgrid.res.in:5799/) will serve as a useful resource for a plant breeders who are interested to pursue epigenetic-based crop improvement research.",AB_0509
"the aromatic-aromatic interactions database (a2id) is a comprehensive repository dedicated to documenting aromatic-aromatic (-) networks observed in experimentally determined protein structures. the first version of a2id was reported in 2011 [int j biol macromol, 2011, 48, 540]. it has undergone a series of significant updates, leading to its current version, which focuses on the identification and analysis of 3,444,619-networks from proteins. the geometrical parameters such as centroid-centroid distances (r) and interplanar angles (phi) were used to identify and characterize-networks. it was observed that among the 84,500 proteins with at least one aromatic-network, about 92.50 % of the instances are found to be either 2(77.34 %) or 3(15.23 %) networks. the analysis of interacting amino acid pairs in 2networks indicated a dominance of phe residues followed by tyr. the updated version of a2id incorporates analysis of-networks based on scop2 and ecod classifiers, in addition to the existing scop, cath, and ec classifications. this expanded scope allows researchers to explore the characteristics and functional implications of-networks in protein structures from multiple perspectives. the current version of a2id along with its extensive dataset and detailed geometric information is publicly accessible using https://acds.neist.res.in/a2idv2.",AB_0509
"network meta-analysis compares multiple interventions and estimates the relative treatment effects between all interventions, combining both direct and indirect evidence. recently, a framework was developed to assess the risk of bias due to missing evidence in network meta-analysis (rob-men) which is part of the more comprehensive framework to evaluate the confidence in the evidence for network meta-analysis (cinema). to produce an overall risk of bias judgement for each network estimate, rob-men: performs an assessment of the bias due to missing evidence in each possible pairwise comparison; combines the assessment with the contribution from the direct pairwise comparisons; considers the potential for small-study effects. to facilitate and semi-automate this process, rob-men has been implemented in a user-friendly web-application (https://cinema.ispm.unibe.ch/rob-men). here we provide a tutorial detailing the functionality and use of the application consisting of data upload, analysis configuration, output visualisation, and production of the tool's output tables for recording the risk of bias assessment. we also illustrate an example application using the demo dataset available for download on the application's homepage. the rob-men web-application is open-source and freely available (https://github.com/esm-ispm-unibe-ch/rob-men).",AB_0509
"robot-assisted therapy and mirror therapy are both effective in promoting upper limb function after stroke and combining these two interventions might yield greater therapeutic effects. we aimed to examine whether using mirror therapy as a priming strategy would augment therapeutic effects of robot-assisted therapy. thirty-seven chronic stroke survivors (24 male/13 female; age = 49.8 +/- 13.7 years) were randomized to receive mirror therapy or sham mirror therapy prior to robot-assisted therapy. all participants received 18 intervention sessions (60 min/session, 3 sessions/week). outcome measures were evaluated at baseline and after the 18-session intervention. motor function was assessed using fugl-meyer assessment and wolf motor function test. daily function was assessed using nottingham extended activities of daily living scale. self-efficacy was assessed using stroke self-efficacy questionnaires and daily living self-efficacy scale. data was analyzed using mixed model analysis of variance. both groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements in measures of motor function and daily function, but no significant between-group differences were found. participants who received mirror therapy prior to robot-assisted therapy showed greater improvements in measures of self-efficacy, compared with those who received sham mirror therapy. our findings suggest that sequentially combined mirror therapy with robot-assisted therapy could be advantageous for enhancing self-efficacy post-stroke.trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct03917511. registered on 17/04/2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ nct03917511.",AB_0509
