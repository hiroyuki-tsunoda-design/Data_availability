"the mpox virus (mpxv) is mutating at an exceptional rate for a dna virus and its global spread is concerning, making genomic surveillance a necessity. with mpoxradar, we provide an interactive dashboard to track virus variants on mutation level worldwide. mpoxradar allows users to select among different genomes as reference for comparison. the occurrence of mutation profiles based on the selected reference is indicated on an interactive world map that shows the respective geographic sampling site in customizable time ranges to easily follow the frequency or trend of defined mutations. furthermore, the user can filter for specific mutations, genes, countries, genome types, and sequencing protocols and download the filtered data directly from mpoxradar. on the server, we automatically download all mpxv genomes and metadata from the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) on a daily basis, align them to the different reference genomes, generate mutation profiles, which are stored and linked to the available metainformation in a database. this makes mpoxradar a practical tool for the genomic survaillance of mpxv, supporting users with limited computational resources. mpoxradar is open-source and freely accessible at https://mpoxradar.net.",AB_0494
"one of the main purposes of cryoem single particle analysis is to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of a macromolecule thanks to the acquisition of many particle images representing different poses of the sample. by estimating the orientation of each projected particle, it is possible to recover the underlying 3d volume by multiple 3d reconstruction methods, usually working either in fourier or in real space. however, the reconstruction from the projected images works under the assumption that all particles in the dataset correspond to the same conformation of the macromolecule. although this requi-site holds for some macromolecules, it is not true for flexible specimens, leading to motion-induced arte-facts in the reconstructed cryoem maps. in this work, we introduce a new algebraic reconstruction technique called zart, which is able to include continuous flexibility information during the reconstruc-tion process to improve local resolution and reduce motion blurring. the conformational changes are mod-elled through zernike3d polynomials. our implementation allows for a multiresolution description of the macromolecule adapting itself to the local resolution of the reconstructed map. in addition, zart has also proven to be a useful algorithm in cases where flexibility is not so dominant, as it improves the overall aspect of the reconstructed maps by improving their local and global resolution.(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://crea-tivecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0494
"the development of alphafold for protein structure prediction has opened a new era in structural biology. this is even more the case for alphafold-multimer for the prediction of protein complexes. the interpretation of these predictions has become more important than ever, but it is difficult for the non-specialist. while an evaluation of the prediction quality is pro-vided for monomeric protein predictions by the alphafold protein structure database, such a tool is missing for predicted complex structures. here, we present the pae viewer webserver(http://www. subtiwiki.uni-goettingen.de/v4/paeviewerdemo), an online tool for the integrated visualization of predicted protein complexes using a 3d structure dis-play combined with an interactive representation of the predicted aligned error (pae). this metric allows an estimation of the quality of the prediction. impor-tantly, our webserver also allows the integration of experimental cross-linking data which helps to inter-pret the reliability of the structure predictions. with the pae viewer, the user obtains a unique online tool which for the first time allows the intuitive evaluation of the pae for protein complex structure predictions with integrated crosslinks.",AB_0494
"background: the objective of this study was to investigate cardiac abnormalities in intensive care unit (icu) survivors of critical illness and to determine whether temporary acute kidney injury (aki) is associated with more pronounced findings on cardiovascular magnetic resonance. methods and results: there were 2175 patients treated in the icu (from 2015 until 2021) due to critical illness who were screened for study eligibility. post-icu patients without known cardiac disease were prospectively recruited from march 2021 to may 2022. participants underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance including assessment of cardiac function, myocardial edema, late gadolinium enhancement, and mapping including extracellular volume fraction. student t test, mann-whitney u test, and chi(2) tests were used. there were 48 icu survivors (46 +/- 15 years of age, 28 men, 29 with aki and continuous kidney replacement therapy, and 19 without aki) and 20 healthy controls who were included. icu survivors had elevated markers of myocardial fibrosis (t1: 995 +/- 31 ms versus 957 +/- 21 ms, p<0.001; extracellular volume fraction: 24.9 +/- 2.5% versus 22.8 +/- 1.2%, p<0.001; late gadolinium enhancement: 1% [0%-3%] versus 0% [0%-0%], p<0.001), more frequent focal late gadolinium enhancement lesions (21% versus 0%, p= 0.03), and an impaired left ventricular function (eg, ejection fraction: 57 +/- 6% versus 60 +/- 5%, p=0.03; systolic longitudinal strain: 20.3 +/- 3.7% versus 23.1 +/- 3.5%, p= 0.004) compared with healthy controls. icu survivors with aki had higher myocardial t1 (1002 +/- 33 ms versus 983 +/- 21 ms; p=0.046) and extracellular volume fraction values (25.6 +/- 2.6% versus 23.9 +/- 1.9%; p=0.02) compared with participants without aki. conclusions: icu survivors of critical illness without previously diagnosed cardiac disease had distinct abnormalities on cardiovascular magnetic resonance including signs of myocardial fibrosis and systolic dysfunction. findings were more abnormal in participants who experienced aki with necessity of continuous kidney replacement therapy during their icu stay. registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct 05034588.",AB_0494
"visually exploring in a real-world 4d spatiotemporal space freely in vr has been a long-term quest. the task is especially appealing when only a few or even single rgb cameras are used for capturing the dynamic scene. to this end, we present an efficient framework capable of fast reconstruction, compact modeling, and streamable rendering. first, we propose to decompose the 4d spatiotemporal space according to temporal characteristics. points in the 4d space are associated with probabilities of belonging to three categories: static, deforming, and new areas. each area is represented and regularized by a separate neural field. second, we propose a hybrid representations based feature streaming scheme for efficiently modeling the neural fields. our approach, coined nerfplayer, is evaluated on dynamic scenes captured by single hand-held cameras and multi-camera arrays, achieving comparable or superior rendering performance in terms of quality and speed comparable to recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving reconstruction in 10 seconds per frame and interactive rendering. project website: https://bit.ly/nerfplayer.",AB_0494
"in this work, we consider the problem of estimating the 3d position of multiple humans in a scene as well as their body shape and articulation from a single rgb video recorded with a static camera. in contrast to expensive marker-based or multi-view systems, our lightweight setup is ideal for private users as it enables an affordable 3d motion capture that is easy to install and does not require expert knowledge. to deal with this challenging setting, we leverage recent advances in computer vision using large-scale pre-trained models for a variety of modalities, including 2d body joints, joint angles, normalized disparity maps, and human segmentation masks. thus, we introduce the first non-linear optimization-based approach that jointly solves for the 3d position of each human, their articulated pose, their individual shapes as well as the scale of the scene. in particular, we estimate the scene depth and person scale from normalized disparity predictions using the 2d body joints and joint angles. given the per-frame scene depth, we reconstruct a point-cloud of the static scene in 3d space. finally, given the per-frame 3d estimates of the humans and scene point-cloud, we perform a space-time coherent optimization over the video to ensure temporal, spatial and physical plausibility. we evaluate our method on established multi-person 3d human pose benchmarks where we consistently outperform previous methods and we qualitatively demonstrate that our method is robust to in-the-wild conditions including challenging scenes with people of different sizes. code: https://github.com/dluvizon/scene-aware-3d-multi-human",AB_0494
"mechanistic dynamic models have become an essential tool for understanding biomolecular networks and other biological systems. biochemical stochasticity can be extremely important in some situations, e.g., at the single-cell level where there is a low copy number of the species involved. in these scenarios, deterministic models are not suitable to characterize the dynamics, so stochastic dynamic models should be considered. here, we address the challenging problem of parameter estimation in stochastic dynamic models. despite recent advances, this area is considerably less mature than its deterministic counterpart. we present a novel strategy based on two components: (i) global optimization via a hybrid stochastic-deterministic approach, and (ii) stochastic simulation techniques tailored to the sparsity of the available experimental data. regarding the latter, for cases of dense population data we make use of a novel approach using a partial integro-differential equation (pide) model solved using a semilagrangian method. in order to further speed up the simulations, we also present efficient parallel implementations for multi-core cpus and also for graphical processing units (gpus). importantly, whereas sde and fokker planck approximations of the chemical master equation (cme) apply when the reactant populations are sufficiently large, the pide approximation to the cme is valid for very low copy numbers, and therefore they enable us to tackle parameter estimation for systems with large intrinsic molecular noise, (highly stochastic regimes far from the thermodynamic limit). we test our strategy with four challenging problems: a lotka-volterra system, a polarization system in s. cerevisiae, a genetic toggle switch, and a genetic circadian oscillator. our method could successfully solve these problems in very reasonable computation times (often a few minutes for the first two problems) using standard low-cost hardware, showing very significant speedups with respect to recent alternative methods. the code used to obtain the results reported here is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5195408.",AB_0494
"recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in end-to-end learned video compression. most previous works explore temporal redundancy by detecting and compressing a motion map to warp the reference frame towards the target frame. yet, it failed to adequately take advantage of the historical priors in the sequential reference frames. in this paper, we propose an advanced learned video compression (alvc) approach with the in-loop frame prediction module, which is able to effectively predict the target frame from the previously compressed frames, without consuming any bit-rate. the predicted frame can serve as a better reference than the previously compressed frame, and therefore it benefits the compression performance. the proposed in-loop prediction module is a part of the end-to-end video compression and is jointly optimized in the whole framework. we propose the recurrent and the bi-directional in-loop prediction modules for compressing p-frames and b-frames, respectively. the experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of our alvc approach in learned video compression. we also outperform the default hierarchical b mode of x265 in terms of psnr and beat the slowest mode of the ssim-tuned x265 on ms-ssim. the project page: https://github.com/renyang-home/alvc.",AB_0494
"the discovery of differentially methylated (dm) regions is an important research field in biology, as it can help to anticipate the risk of suffering from specific diseases. nevertheless, the high computational cost of the bioinformatic tools developed for this purpose prevents their application to large-scale datasets. hence, much faster tools are required to further progress in this research field. in this work we present parradmeth, a parallel tool that applies beta-binomial regression for the identification of these dm regions. it is based on the state-of-the-art sequential tool radmeth, which proved superior biological accuracy compared to counterparts in previous experimental evaluations. parradmeth provides the same dm regions as radmeth but at significantly reduced runtime thanks to exploiting the compute capabilities of common multicore cpu clusters. for example, our tool is up to 189 times faster for real data experiments on a cluster with 16 nodes, each one containing two eight-core processors. the source code of parradmeth, as well as a reference manual, are available at https://github.com/udc-gac/parradmeth.",AB_0494
"pro-simat is a simulation tool for analysing protein interaction networks, their dynamic change and pathway engineering. it provides go enrichment, kegg pathway analyses, and network visualisation from an integrated database of more than 8 million protein-protein interactions across 32 model organisms and the human proteome. we integrated dynamical network simulation using the jimena framework, which quickly and efficiently simulates boolean genetic regulatory networks. it enables simulation outputs with in-depth analysis of the type, strength, duration and pathway of the protein interactions on the website. furthermore, the user can efficiently edit and analyse the effect of network modifications and engineering experiments. in case studies, applications of pro-simat are demonstrated: (i) understanding mutually exclusive differentiation pathways in bacillus subtilis, (ii) making vaccinia virus oncolytic by switching on its viral replication mainly in cancer cells and triggering cancer cell apoptosis and (iii) optogenetic control of nucleotide processing protein networks to operate dna storage. multilevel communication between components is critical for efficient network switching, as demonstrated by a general census on prokaryotic and eukaryotic networks and comparing design with synthetic networks using pro-simat. the tool is available at https://prosimat.heinzelab.de/ as a web-based query server.
