"motivation: the importance and rate of development of genome-scale metabolic models have been growing for the last few years, increasing the demand for software solutions that automate several steps of this process. however, since triage's release, software development for the automatic integration of transport reactions into models has stalled. results: here, we present the transport systems tracker (transyt). unlike other transport systems annotation software, transyt does not rely on manual curation to expand its internal database, which is derived from highly curated records retrieved from the transporters classification database and complemented with information from other data sources. transyt compiles information regarding transporter families and proteins, and derives reactions into its internal database, making it available for rapid annotation of complete genomes. all transport reactions have gpr associations and can be exported with identifiers from four different metabolite databases. transyt is currently available as a plugin for merlin v4.0 and an app for kbase. availability and implementation: transyt web service: https://transyt.bio.di.uminho.pt/; github for the tool: https://github.com/biosystemsum/ transyt; github with examples and instructions to run transyt: https://github.com/ecunha1996/transyt_paper.",AB_0532
"motivation: the advent of t-cell receptor (tcr) sequencing experiments allowed for a significant increase in the amount of peptide:tcr binding data available and a number of machine-learning models appeared in recent years. high-quality prediction models for a fixed epitope sequence are feasible, provided enough known binding tcr sequences are available. however, their performance drops significantly for previously unseen peptides. results: we prepare the dataset of known peptide:tcr binders and augment it with negative decoys created using healthy donors' t-cell repertoires. we employ deep learning methods commonly applied in natural language processing to train part a peptide:tcr binding model with a degree of cross-peptide generalization (0.69 auroc). we demonstrate that bertrand outperforms the published methods when evaluated on peptide sequences not used during model training. availability and implementation: the datasets and the code for model training are available at https://github.com/sfglab/bertrand.",AB_0532
"polyglutamine (polyq) diseases are neurodegenerative disorders caused by abnormally expanded cytosine, adenine, guanine (cag) triplet repeat sequences in the coding region of otherwise unrelated genes. until now, nine different polyq diseases have been described: huntington's disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and six types of spinocerebellar ataxias-1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 17. the pathogenic expansion translates into an aberrant tract of glutamines in the encoded proteins, compromising several cellular functions and biological processes. there is currently no cure available for the progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by the ensuing cytotoxic alterations. although each disease is considered rare, polyq diseases constitute the largest group of monogenic neurodegenerative disorders. information about these disorders is scattered among several books, articles and general databases, hindering exploration by students and researchers, but also by patients and their families. therefore, we aimed to develop a free online database to fill this gap, by centralizing relevant available information. the polyq database is a platform that focuses on all nine polyq diseases and offers information about topics that are pertinent for scientists, clinicians and the general public, including epidemiology, the characteristics of the causative genes and the codified proteins, the pathophysiology of the diseases and the main clinical manifestations. the database is available at https://polyq.pt/, and it is the first of its kind, focusing exclusively on this group of rare diseases. the database was conceived to be continuously updated and allow incorporation and dissemination of the latest information on polyq diseases.",AB_0532
"a recent examination of type specimens and unidentified indian cuckoo wasps deposited at the natural history museum (london) and at the oxford university museum of natural history led to the discovery of: two new indian species, chrysis parviocula sp. n. (amneris species group) and elampus bicolor sp. n.; a new synonymy, chrysis quaerita nurse, 1902 syn. n. of chrysis dissimilis dahlbom, 1854; an unnecessary replacement name, hedychridium mocsaryi rosa, 2021 for hedychridium virescens (mocsary, 1914); and a misidentification of chrysis obscura smith, 1860 which is now excluded from the indian fauna. chrysis perfecta cameron, 1897 is transferred to the viridissima group. new distributional records are given for chrysis arkadyi rosa et al. 2021, chrysis bayadera du buysson, 1896, chrysis musa semenov-tian-shanskij, 1954 and praestochrysis palawanensis (mocsary, 1899). eighteen types of indian and oriental species are illustrated for the first time. types of six oriental and australian species described by cameron, smith, and gray are illustrated and their status and depositories discussed. a lectotype is designated for chrysis festina smith, 1874. type material of stilbum princeps (gray, 1832) is rediscovered 190 years after its description.http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:fe496b54-40bb-4049-ba71-058bee5553ae",AB_0532
"outlier detection is crucial for improving the performance of machine learning algorithms and is particularly vital in data sets possessing a small number of points. while the existing outlier detection methods deliver good results on a certain data set, the results are rather down on some data sets. besides all these aspects, there is also a need for an algorithm that quickly processes high-dimensional data sets. to satisfy these requirements, we propose an unsupervised local outlier detection method that can draw the neighborhood boundaries of the data points via chebyshev inequality. the proposed method sets the boundaries of the points through the socalled deviation parameter that correlates to the standard deviation of the data distribution and then detects outliers by quantifying their neighborhood densities. the experimental results on real-world and synthetic data sets show the efficacy of the proposed method in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods. the source code of the proposed algorithm and the data sets are at https://github.com/fatihaydin1/bldod.",AB_0532
"in the metaverse, digital avatar plays an important role in representing human beings for various interaction with virtual objects and environments, which puts a high demand on effective pose estimation. though camera-based solutions yield remarkable performance, they encounter privacy issues and degraded performance caused by varying illumination, especially in the smart home. in this article, we propose a wifi-based internet of things-enabled human pose estimation scheme for metaverse avatar simulation, namely, metafi++. specifically, wpformer is designed with a shared convolutional module and a transformer block to map the channel state information of wifi signals to human pose landmarks, effectively exploring spatial information of human pose through self-attention. it is enforced to learn the annotations from the accurate computer vision model, thus achieving cross-modal supervision. due to the ubiquitous existence of wifi and robustness to various illumination conditions, wifi-based human poses are suitable to instruct the movement of digital avatars in the metaverse, promoting avatar applications in smart homes. the experiments are conducted in the real world, and the results show that the metafi++ achieves very high performance with a pck@50 of 97.30%. our codes are available in https://github.com/pridy999/metafi_pose_estimation.",AB_0532

"in this paper, we present a new feature selection algorithm for supervised problems. we build our algorithm upon recently proposed infinite feature selection (inf-fs) method where features are ranked based on path integrals and the centrality concept on a feature adjacency graph. the proposed algorithm firstly clusters the feature space into a predefined number of subspaces. then ranks the features in each subspace using inf-fs method. finally merges the resultant subranks using a combined measure of information theory and clusters size. we extensively evaluate our algorithm on six benchmark datasets, and show that our method outperforms inf-fs in terms of the accuracy, running time, and memory consumption. the codes are available at https://github.com/sadegh28/cinf-fs.",AB_0532
"motivation: aligning reads to a variation graph is a standard task in pangenomics, with downstream applications such as improving variant calling. while the vg toolkit [garrison et al. (variation graph toolkit improves read mapping by representing genetic variation in the reference. nat biotechnol 2018;36:875-9)] is a popular aligner of short reads, graphaligner [rautiainen and marschall (graphaligner: rapid and versatile sequence-to-graph alignment. genome biol 2020;21:253-28)] is the state-of-the-art aligner of erroneous long reads. graphaligner works by finding candidate read occurrences based on individually extending the best seeds of the read in the variation graph. however, a more principled approach recognized in the community is to co-linearly chain multiple seeds. results: we present a new algorithm to co-linearly chain a set of seeds in a string labeled acyclic graph, together with the first efficient implementation of such a co-linear chaining algorithm into a new aligner of erroneous long reads to acyclic variation graphs, graphchainer. we run experiments aligning real and simulated pacbio clr reads with average error rates 15% and 5%. compared to graphaligner, graphchainer aligns 12-17% more reads, and 21-28% more total read length, on real pacbio clr reads from human chromosomes 1, 22, and the whole human pangenome. on both simulated and real data, graphchainer aligns between 95% and 99% of all reads, and of total read length. we also show that minigraph [li et al. (the design and construction of reference pangenome graphs with minigraph. genome biol 2020;21:265-19.)] and minichain [chandra and jain (sequence to graph alignment using gap-sensitive co-linear chaining. in: proceedings of the 27th annual international conference on research in computational molecular biology (recomb 2023). springer, 2023, 58-73.)] obtain an accuracy of <60% on this setting. availability and implementation: graphchainer is freely available at https://github.com/algbio/graphchainer. the datasets and evaluation pipeline can be reached from the previous address.",AB_0532
"psgen is a new general purpose fortran program which has been written to facilitate the monte carlo phase space integration of the smatrix element of any 2 -> n scattering process, with n = 2,..., 9, provided by the user. the program is written in fortran 90/95. it uses a new very fast algorithm that automatically generates calls to fortran subroutines containing different phase space parameterizations of the considered class of processes. the parameterizations take into account mappings of poles due to the feynman propagators of unstable heavy particles decaying into 2 or 3 on shell final state particles according to predefined patterns, possible single or double t-channel poles and peaks due to one on shell photon or gluon radiation. the individual subroutines are organized in a single multichannel kinematics subroutine which can be easily called while computing the phase space integral of the smatrix element as a function of generated particle four momenta, in either the leading or higher orders of the perturbation series. the particle four momenta can be used in a quadruple precision version, if necessary. program summary program title: psgen cpc library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/y7nprysy8g.1 developer's repository link: https://www.kk.us.edu.pl/psgen.html licensing provisions: gplv3 programming language: fortran 90/95 nature of problem: automatic generation of fortran routines which allow for the multichannel monte carlo integration of user's provided smatrix element as a function of generated particle four momenta of any 2 -> n, with n = 2,..., 9, scattering process. the smatrix can be defined in either the leading or higher orders. solution method: a new very fast algorithm written in fortran 90/95 generates calls to different handwritten subroutines containing phase space parameterizations which, among others, take into account poles due to the feynman propagators of unstable heavy particles decaying into 2 or 3 on shell final state particles according to predefined patterns, possible single or double t-channel poles and peaks due to one on shell photon or gluon radiation. the generated routines are moved to a directory, where they are combined in a single properly normalized multichannel phase space parameterization. the corresponding kinematics subroutine is self-consistent and can be readily combined with any program which calculates the smatrix element in either the leading or higher orders of the perturbation series. the particle four momenta can be generated in a quadruple precision version, if necessary. the automatically generated subroutine containing calls to different kinematics subroutines can be easily supplemented with calls to user's own made kinematics subroutines.
