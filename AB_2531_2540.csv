"cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of premature death in humans and remain a global public health challenge. while age, sex, family history, and false nutrition make a contribution, our understanding of compounds acting as cardiovascular disruptors is far from complete. here, we aim to identify cardiovascular disruptors via a reduced transcriptome atlas (rta) approach, which integrates large-scale transcriptome data sets of zebrafish and compiles a specific gene panel related to cardiovascular diseases. among 767 gene expression profiles covering 81 environmental compounds, 11 priority compounds are identified with the greatest effects on the cardiovascular system at the transcriptional level. among them, metals (agno3, ag nanoparticles, arsenic) and pesticides/biocides (linuron, methylparaben, triclosan, and trimethylchlorotin) are identified with the most significant effects. distinct transcriptional signatures are further identified by the percentage values, indicating that different physiological endpoints exist among prioritized compounds. in addition, cardiovascular dysregulations are experimentally confirmed for the prioritized compounds via alterations of cardiovascular physiology and lipid profiles of zebrafish. the accuracy rate of experimental verification reaches up to 62.9%. the web-based rta analysis tool, cardionet, for rapid cardiovascular disruptor discovery was further provided at http://www.envh.sjtu.edu.cn/cardionet.jsp. our integrative approach yields an efficient platform to discover novel cardiovascular-disrupting chemicals in the environment.",AB_0254
"fusing hyperspectral images (hsis) and multispectral images (msis) is an economic and feasible way to obtain images with both high spectral resolution and spatial resolution. due to the limited receptive field of convolution kernels, fusion methods based on convolutional neural networks (cnns) fail to take advantage of the global relationship in a feature map. in this paper, to exploit the powerful capability of transformer to extract global information from the whole feature map for fusion, we propose a novel multiscale spatial- spectral transformer network (msst-net). the proposed network is a two-branch network that integrates the self-attention mechanism of the transformer to extract spectral features from hsi and spatial features from msi, respectively. before feature extraction, cross-modality concatenations are performed to achieve cross -modality information interaction between the two branches. then, we propose a spectral transformer (spet) to extract spectral features and introduce multiscale band/patch embeddings to obtain multiscale features through spets and spatial transformers (spats). to further improve the network's performance and generalization, we proposed a self-supervised pre-training strategy, in which a masked bands autoencoder (mbae) and a masked patches autoencoder (mpae) are specially designed for self-supervised pre-training of the spets and spats. extensive experiments on simulated and real datasets illustrate that the proposed network can achieve better performance when compared to other state-of-the-art fusion methods. the code of msst-net will be available at http://www.jiasen.tech/papers/ for the sake of reproducibility.",AB_0254
"the segmentation of pepper leaves from pepper images is of great significance for the accurate control of pepper leaf diseases. to address the issue, we propose a bidirectional attention fusion network combing the convolution neural network (cnn) and swin transformer, called baf-net, to segment the pepper leaf image. specially, baf-net first uses a multi-scale fusion feature (msff) branch to extract the long-range dependencies by constructing the cascaded swin transformer-based and cnn-based block, which is based on the u-shape architecture. then, it uses a full-scale feature fusion (fsff) branch to enhance the boundary information and attain the detailed information. finally, an adaptive bidirectional attention module is designed to bridge the relation of the msff and fsff features. the results on four pepper leaf datasets demonstrated that our model obtains f1 scores of 96.75%, 91.10%, 97.34% and 94.42%, and iou of 95.68%, 86.76%, 96.12% and 91.44%, respectively. compared to the state-of-the-art models, the proposed model achieves better segmentation performance. the code will be available at the website: https://github.com/fangchj2002/ baf-net.",AB_0254
"in clinics, a radiology report is crucial for guiding a patient's treatment. however, writing radiology reports is a heavy burden for radiologists. to this end, we present an automatic, multi-modal approach for report generation from a chest x-ray. our approach, motivated by the observation that the descriptions in radiology reports are highly correlated with specific information of the x-ray images, features two distinct modules: (i) learned knowledge base: to absorb the knowledge embedded in the radiology reports, we build a knowledge base that can automatically distill and restore medical knowledge from textual embedding without manual labor; (ii) multi-modal alignment: to promote the semantic alignment among reports, disease labels, and images, we explicitly utilize textual embedding to guide the learning of the visual feature space. we evaluate the performance of the proposed model using metrics from both natural language generation and clinic efficacy on the public iu-xray and mimic-cxr datasets. our ablation study shows that each module contributes to improving the quality of generated reports. furthermore, the assistance of both modules, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods over almost all the metrics. code is available at https://github.com/lx-doctorai1/m2kt.",AB_0254
"as the most aggressive tumor, tnm staging does not accurately identify patients with pancreatic cancer who are sensitive to therapy. this study aimed to identify associated risk factors and develop a nomogram to predict survival in pancreatic cancer surgery patients and to select the most appropriate comprehensive treatment regimen. first, the survival difference between radiotherapy and no radiotherapy was calculated based on propensity score matching (psm). cox regression was conducted to select the predictors of overall survival (os). the model was constructed using seven variables: histologic type, grade, t stage, n stage, stage, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. all patients were classified into high-or low-risk groups based on the nomogram. the nomogram model for os was established and showed good calibration and acceptable discrimination (c-index 0.721). receiver operating characteristic curve (roc) and dca curves showed that nomograms had better predictive performance than tnm stage. patients were divided into low-risk and high-risk groups according to nomogram scores. radiotherapy is recommended for high-risk patients but not for low-risk patients. we have established a well-performing nomogram to effectively predict the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients underlying surgery. the web version of the nomogram https:// rocke ric.shiny apps.io/ dynno mapp/ may contribute to treatment optimization in clinical practice.",AB_0254
"exosomes cargo tumour-characterized biomolecules secreted from cancer cells and play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, thus providing their potential for non-invasive cancer monitoring. since cancer cell-derived exosomes are often mixed with those from healthy cells in liquid biopsy of tumour patients, accurately measuring the purity of tumour cell-derived exosomes is not only critical for the early detection but also essential for unbiased identification of diagnosis biomarkers. here, we propose exosomepurity', a tumour purity deconvolution model to estimate tumour purity in serum exosomes of cancer patients based on microribonucleic acid (mirna)-seq data. we first identify the differently expressed mirnas as signature to distinguish cancer cell-from healthy cell-derived exosomes. then, the deconvolution model was developed to estimate the proportions of cancer exosomes and normal exosomes in serum. the purity predicted by the model shows high correlation with actual purity in simulated data and actual data. moreover, the model is robust under the different levels of noise background. the tumour purity was also used to correct differential expressed gene analysis. exosomepurity empowers the research community to study non-invasive early diagnosis and to track cancer progression in cancers more efficiently. it is implemented in r and is freely available from github (https://github.com/wanghylab/exosomepurity).",AB_0254
"the multispectral (ms) and the panchromatic (pan) images represent complementary and synergistic spatial spectral information, how to make optimal use of the advantages of them has become a hot research topic. this paper proposes a selectable transformer and gist cnn network (stgc-net). it designs a subspace similar recombination module (ssr-module) based on non-negative matrix factorization (nmf) and the self-attention mechanism for feature decomposition. this can alleviate the redundant information of multi-modal data and extract their own singular and common features. considering that the ms and the pan images exhibit different advantageous properties, a selectable self-attention spectral feature extraction module (s3fe-module) and a multi-stream gist spatial feature extraction module (mgsfe-module) are proposed for the different singular features. the former can refine the transformer's input and simultaneously characterize the sequence information between channels for the ms image. the latter introduces the positional relationship between local features while extracting spatial features for the pan image, thereby improving the accuracy of scene classification. experimental results indicate that the proposed method performs better than the other methods. the relevant code of this paper is provided at: https://github.com/ru-willow/st-gc-net.",AB_0254
"objective. manual detection of obstructive sleep apnea (osa) is a challenging task for many reasons such as time-consuming and subjective. this study aimed to develop a deep learning model for automatically detecting abnormal sleep respiratory episodes in patients with osa and to explore the performance differences between different sleep centers and different kind of sleep monitoring devices. methods. the proposed model which comprised branch convolution, separable convolution, and self-attention mechanisms, took minute-to-minute raw electroencephalography (eeg) and oral-nasal airflow signals as its input. results. the results of five-fold cross-validation in 50 clinical polysomnography recordings evidenced that the average accuracy was 0.877, with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.837, and 0.873, respectively. the proposed method achieved almost perfect agreement with manual scoring method according to the apnea-hypopnea index. in addition, experiments revealed that the combination of eeg and oral-nasal airflow signals could improve the accuracy of approximately 10% relative to oral-nasal airflow signals. furthermore, a significant difference (p < 0.05) in performance be-tween different sleep centers and different sleep-monitoring devices was also observed. conclusion and signif-icance. the proposed model achieved a comparably high performance in three different sleep centers, indicating its feasibility and robustness. this study suggested the reliable and simple alternative to clinical osa screening. the model and data can be found at https://github.com/lifanfan-dlut/osa-detection.",AB_0254
"doublets formed during single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) severely affect downstream studies, such as differentially expressed gene analysis and cell trajectory inference, and limit the cellular throughput of scrna-seq. several doublet detection algorithms are currently available, but their generalization performance could be further improved due to the lack of effective feature-embedding strategies with suitable model architectures. therefore, socube, a novel deep learning algorithm, was developed to precisely detect doublets in various types of scrna-seq data. socube (i) proposed a novel 3d composite feature-embedding strategy that embedded latent gene information and (ii) constructed a multikernel, multichannel cnn-ensembled architecture in conjunction with the feature-embedding strategy. with its excellent performance on benchmark evaluation and several downstream tasks, it is expected to be a powerful algorithm to detect and remove doublets in scrna-seq data. socube is freely provided as an end-to-end tool on the python official package site pypi (https://pypi.org/project/socube/) and open-source on github (https://github.com/idrblab/socube/).",AB_0254
"chemical mutagenicity is a serious issue that needs to be addressed in early drug discovery. over a long period of time, medicinal chemists have manually summarized a series of empirical rules for the optimization of chemical mutagenicity. however, given the rising amount of data, it is getting more difficult for medicinal chemists to identify more comprehensive chemical rules behind the biochemical data. herein, we integrated a large ames mutagenicity data set with 8576 compounds to derive mutagenicity transformation rules for reversing ames mutagenicity via matched molecular pairs analysis. a well-trained consensus model with a reasonable applicability domain was constructed, which showed favorable performance in the external validation set with an accuracy of 0.815. the model was used to assess the generalizability and validity of these mutagenicity transformation rules. the results demonstrated that these rules were of great value and could provide inspiration for the structural modifications of compounds with potential mutagenic effects. we also found that the local chemical environment of the attachment points of rules was critical for successful transformation. to facilitate the use of these mutagenicity transformation rules, we integrated them into admetopt2 (http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/admetsar2/admetopt2/), a free web server for optimization of chemical admet properties. the above-mentioned approach would be extended to the optimization of other toxicity endpoints.",AB_0254
