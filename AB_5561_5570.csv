"objectivestimulation of the peripheral visual field has been previously reported as beneficial for cognitive performance in adhd. this study assesses the safety and efficacy of a novel intervention involving peripheral visual stimuli in managing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd).methodsone hundred and eight adults, 18-40 years old, with adhd, were enrolled in a two-month open-label study. the intervention (i.e., neuro-glasses) consisted of standard eyeglasses with personalized peripheral visual stimuli embedded on the lenses. participants were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study with self-report measures of adhd symptoms (the adult adhd self-report scale; asrs), and executive functions (the behavior rating inventory of executive function adult version; brief-a). a computerized test of continuous performance (the conners' continuous performance test-3; cpt-3) was tested at baseline with standard eyeglasses and at the end of study using neuro-glasses. the clinical global impression-improvement scale (cgi-i) was assessed at the intervention endpoint. safety was monitored by documentation of adverse events.resultsthe efficacy analysis included 97 participants. significant improvements were demonstrated in self-reported measures of inattentive symptoms (asrs inattentive index; p = 0.037) and metacognitive functions concerning self-management and performance monitoring (brief-a; p = 0.029). a continuous-performance test (cpt-3) indicated significant improvement in detectability (d'; p = 0.027) and reduced commission errors (p = 0.004), suggesting that the neuro-glasses have positive effects on response inhibition. sixty-two percent of the participants met the response criteria assessed by a clinician (cgi-i). no major adverse events were reported.conclusionneuro-glasses may offer a safe and effective approach to managing adult adhd. results encourage future controlled efficacy studies to confirm current findings in adults and possibly children with adhd.clinical trial registration: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier nct05777785.conclusionneuro-glasses may offer a safe and effective approach to managing adult adhd. results encourage future controlled efficacy studies to confirm current findings in adults and possibly children with adhd.clinical trial registration: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier nct05777785.",AB_0557
"backgroundearly detection and localization of myocardial infarction (mi) can reduce the severity of cardiac damage through timely treatment interventions. in recent years, deep learning techniques have shown promise for detecting mi in echocardiographic images. existing attempts typically formulate this task as classification and rely on a single segmentation model to estimate myocardial segment displacements. however, there has been no examination of how segmentation accuracy affects mi classification performance or the potential benefits of using ensemble learning approaches. our study investigates this relationship and introduces a robust method that combines features from multiple segmentation models to improve mi classification performance by leveraging ensemble learning.materials and methodsour method combines myocardial segment displacement features from multiple segmentation models, which are then input into a typical classifier to estimate the risk of mi. we validated the proposed approach on two datasets: the public hmc-qu dataset (109 echocardiograms) for training and validation, and an e-hospital dataset (60 echocardiograms) from a local clinical site in vietnam for independent testing. model performance was evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.resultsthe proposed approach demonstrated excellent performance in detecting mi. it achieved an f1 score of 0.942, corresponding to an accuracy of 91.4%, a sensitivity of 94.1%, and a specificity of 88.3%. the results showed that the proposed approach outperformed the state-of-the-art feature-based method, which had a precision of 85.2%, a specificity of 70.1%, a sensitivity of 85.9%, an accuracy of 85.5%, and an accuracy of 80.2% on the hmc-qu dataset. on the external validation set, the proposed model still performed well, with an f1 score of 0.8, an accuracy of 76.7%, a sensitivity of 77.8%, and a specificity of 75.0%.conclusionsour study demonstrated the ability to accurately predict mi in echocardiograms by combining information from several segmentation models. further research is necessary to determine its potential use in clinical settings as a tool to assist cardiologists and technicians with objective assessments and reduce dependence on operator subjectivity. our research codes are available on github at https://github.com/vinuni-vishc/mi-detection-echo.",AB_0557
"background public health officials are responding to an outbreak of fungal meningitis among patients who received procedures under epidural anesthesia at 2 clinics (river side surgical center and clinica k-3) in matamoros, mexico, during 1 january to 13 may 2023. this report describes outbreak epidemiology and outlines interim diagnostic and treatment recommendations.methods interim recommendations for diagnosis and management were developed by the mycoses study group research education and consortium (msgerc) based on the clinical experience of clinicians caring for patients during the current outbreak or during previous outbreaks of healthcare-associated fungal meningitis in durango, mexico, and the united states.results as of 7 july 2023, the situation has evolved into a multistate and multinational fungal meningitis outbreak. a total of 185 residents in 22 us states and jurisdictions have been identified who might be at risk of fungal meningitis because they received epidural anesthesia at the clinics of interest in 2023. among these patients, 11 suspected, 10 probable, and 10 confirmed us cases have been diagnosed, with severe vascular complications and 8 deaths occurring. fusarium solani species complex has been identified as the causative agent, with antifungal susceptibility testing of a single isolate demonstrating poor in vitro activity for most available antifungals. currently, triple therapy with intravenous voriconazole, liposomal amphotericin b, and fosmanogepix is recommended.conclusions efforts to understand the source of this outbreak and optimal treatment approaches are ongoing, but infectious diseases physicians should be aware of available treatment recommendations. new information will be available on the centers for disease control and prevention's (cdc's) website. public health officials are investigating a multistate fungal meningitis outbreak affecting us residents who received epidural anesthesia at 2 clinics in matamoros, mexico, from 1 january to 13 may 2023. we summarize current epidemiology, clinical characteristics, interim treatment recommendations, and ongoing challenges. graphical abstract this graphical abstract is also available at tidbit: https://tidbitapp.io/tidbits/update-on-outbreak-of-fungal-meningitis-among-u-s-residents-who-received-epidural-anesthesia-at-two-clinics-in-matamoros-mexico-4ac506e4-c163-4f4a-b2f7-c96223f2a045",AB_0557
"motivation: optical genome mapping (ogm) is a technique that extracts partial genomic information from optically imaged and linearized dna fragments containing fluorescently labeled short sequence patterns. this information can be used for various genomic analyses and applications, such as the detection of structural variations and copy-number variations, epigenomic profiling, and microbial species identification. currently, the choice of labeled patterns is based on the available biochemical methods and is not necessarily optimized for the application. results: in this work, we develop a model of ogm based on information theory, which enables the design of optimal labeling patterns for specific applications and target organism genomes. we validated the model through experimental ogm on human dna and simulations on bacterial dna. our model predicts up to 10-fold improved accuracy by optimal choice of labeling patterns, which may guide future development of ogm biochemical labeling methods and significantly improve its accuracy and yield for applications such as epigenomic profiling and cultivation-free pathogen identification in clinical samples. availability and implementation: https://github.com/yevgenin/patterncode",AB_0557
"the rapid growth of sequencing technology and its increasing popularity in biology-related research over the years has made whole genome re-sequencing (wgrs) data become widely available. a large amount of wgrs data can unlock the knowledge gap between genomics and phenomics through gaining an understanding of the genomic variations that can lead to phenotype changes. these genomic variations are usually comprised of allele and structural changes in dna, and these changes can affect the regulatory mechanisms causing changes in gene expression and altering the phenotypes of organisms. in this research work, we created the genvarx toolset, that is backed by transcription factor binding sequence data in promoter regions, the copy number variations data, snps and indels data, and phenotypes data which can potentially provide insights about phenotypic differences and solve compelling questions in plant research. analytics-wise, we have developed strategies to better utilize the wgrs data and mine the data using efficient data processing scripts, libraries, tools, and frameworks to create the interactive and visualization-enhanced genvarx toolset that encompasses both promoter regions and copy number variation analysis components. the main capabilities of the genvarx toolset are to provide easy-to-use interfaces for users to perform queries, visualize data, and interact with the data. based on different input windows on the user interface, users can provide inputs corresponding to each field and submit the information as a query. the data returned on the results page is usually displayed in a tabular fashion. in addition, interactive figures are also included in the toolset to facilitate the visualization of statistical results or tool outputs. currently, the genvarx toolset supports soybean, rice, and arabidopsis. the researchers can access the soybean genvarx toolset from soykb via https://soykb.org/soybeangenvarx/, rice genvarx toolset, and arabidopsis genvarx toolset from kbcommons web portal with links https://kbcommons.org/system/tools/genvarx/osativa and https://kbcommons.org/system/tools/genvarx/athaliana, respectively.",AB_0557
"convolutional neural networks (cnns) have been the most popular image classification tool for a long time. inspired by the greater success of the transformer structure in natural language processing, the vision transformer (vit) was recently proposed as a more efficient image classification tool based on the attention mechanism. several newer models, such as pooling-based vision transformer (pit), convolutional vision transformer (cvt), crossformer, crossvit, nest, maxvit and separable vision transformer (sepvit), have since been developed to improve upon the accuracy and generalization ability of vit. this study aims to perform a comprehensive comparison between the performances of these eight models. they are employed for image classification on the breakhis and idc datasets for the purpose of digital breast cancer histopathology. after training on breakhis they are fine tuned on idc in order to test their generalization ability. their performance is also compared to the existing state-of-the-art. maxvit is found to be the best transformer based classifier, achieving a test accuracy of 91.57% on breakhis, 91.8% on idc, and 92.12% when pre-trained on breakhis and then fine tuned on idc. however, none of the chosen models exhibit a significantly improved performance in comparison to existing works. thus, the common characteristics of the best performing models are highlighted, and structural suggestions for further improvement in their accuracy and generalization ability are made. finally, our findings are summarized, and the future scope is laid out. source codes are available at https://github.com/itsparmesan/vit-comparative-study.",AB_0557
"background: despite constantly improving genome sequencing methods, error-free eukaryotic genome assembly has not yet been achieved. among other kinds of problems of eukaryotic genome assembly are so-called haplotypic duplications, which may manifest themselves as cases of alleles being mistakenly assembled as paralogues. haplotypic duplications are dangerous because they create illusions of gene family expansions and, thus, may lead scientists to incorrect conclusions about genome evolution and functioning. results: here, i present mabs, a suite of tools that serve as parameter optimizers of the popular genome assemblers hifiasm and flye. by optimizing the parameters of hifiasm and flye, mabs tries to create genome assemblies with the genes assembled as accurately as possible. tests on 6 eukaryotic genomes showed that in 6 out of 6 cases, mabs created assemblies with more accurately assembled genes than those generated by hifiasm and flye when they were run with default parameters. when assemblies of mabs, hifiasm and flye were postprocessed by a popular tool for haplotypic duplication removal, purge_dups, genes were better assembled by mabs in 5 out of 6 cases. conclusions: mabs is useful for making high-quality genome assemblies. it is available at https://github.com/shelkmike/mabs",AB_0557
"background: laparoscopic resection for colon cancer has not been associated with improvements in oncological outcomes in comparison to open resection. robotic resections are associated with increased lymph node yield and radicality of mesenteric resection in patients with right-sided tumors. it is unclear whether lymph node yield is higher in robotic resections in other parts of the colon and whether higher lymph node yield is associated with improved survival. objective: to compare survival rates between robotic, laparoscopic, and open resections in a large cohort of patients with nonmetastatic colon cancer. design: this is a retrospective observational study. setting: a single comprehensive cancer center. patients: patients who underwent resection of nonmetastatic primary colon cancer between january 2006 and december 2018. main outcome measures: univariable and multivariable models were used to identify predictors of disease-free and overall survival. lymph node yield and perioperative outcomes were compared between operative approaches. results: there were 2398 patients who met the inclusion criteria: 699 (29%) underwent open, 824 (34%) underwent laparoscopic, and 875 (36%) underwent robotic resection. the median follow-up was 3.8 years (45.4 months). robotic surgery was associated with higher lymph node yield and radicality of mesenteric resection. on multivariable analysis, the surgical approach was not associated with a difference in disease-free or overall survival. minimally invasive colectomy was associated with fewer complications and shorter length of stay in comparison to open surgery. in a direct comparison between the 2 minimally invasive approaches, robotic colectomy was associated with fewer complications, shorter length of stay, and lower conversion rate than laparoscopy. limitations: this was a single-center retrospective study. conclusions: our data indicate that the 3 surgical approaches are similarly effective in treating primary resectable colon cancer and that differences in outcomes are observed primarily in the early postoperative period. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c115.",AB_0557
"the current challenges of structural biophysics include determining the structure of large self-assembled com-plexes, resolving the structure of ensembles of complex structures and their mass fraction, and unraveling the dynamic pathways and mechanisms leading to the formation of complex structures from their subunits. modern synchrotron solution x-ray scattering data enable simultaneous high-spatial and high-temporal structural data required to address the current challenges of structural biophysics. these data are complementary to crystal-lography, nmr, and cryo-tem data. however, the analysis of solution scattering data is challenging; hence many different analysis tools, listed in the sas portal (http://smallangle.org/), were developed. in this review, we start by briefly summarizing classical x-ray scattering analyses providing insight into fundamental structural and interaction parameters. we then describe recent developments, integrating simulations, theory, and advanced x-ray scattering modeling, providing unique insights into the structure, energetics, and dynamics of self-assembled complexes. the structural information is essential for understanding the underlying physical chemistry principles leading to self-assembled supramolecular architectures and computational structural refinement.",AB_0557
"we introduce the huenet a novel deep learning framework for a differentiable construction of intensity (1d) and joint (2d) histograms and present its applicability to paired and unpaired image-to-image translation problems. the key idea is an innovative technique for augmenting a generative neural network by histogram layers appended to the image generator. these histogram layers allow us to define two new histogram-based loss functions for constraining the structural appearance of the synthesized output image and its color distribution. specifically, the color similarity loss is defined by the earth mover's distance between the intensity histograms of the network output and a color reference image. the structural similarity loss is determined by the mutual information between the output and a content reference image based on their joint histogram. although the huenet can be applied to a variety of image-to-image translation problems, we chose to demonstrate its strength on the tasks of color transfer, exemplar-based image colorization, and edges ? photo, where the colors of the output image are predefined. the code is available at https://github.com/mor-avi-aharon-bgu/huenet.git.",AB_0557
