"motivation: the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria makes the discovery of new antibiotics an urgent issue, but finding new molecules with the desired antibacterial activity is an extremely difficult task. to address this challenge, we established a framework, mdags (molecular design via attribute-guided search), to optimize and generate potent antibiotic molecules. results: by designing the antibacterial activity latent space and guiding the optimization of functional compounds based on this space, the model mdags can generate novel compounds with desirable antibacterial activity without the need for extensive expensive and time-consuming evaluations. compared with existing antibiotics, candidate antibacterial compounds generated by mdags always possessed significantly better antibacterial activity and ensured high similarity. furthermore, although without explicit constraints on similarity to known antibiotics, these candidate antibacterial compounds all exhibited the highest structural similarity to antibiotics of expected function in the drugbank database query. overall, our approach provides a viable solution to the problem of bacterial drug resistance. availability and implementation: code of the model and datasets can be downloaded from github (https://github. com/liangyu-xidian/mdags).",AB_0261
"motivation: protein-protein interaction (ppi) networks and transcriptional regulatory networks are critical in regulating cells and their signaling. a thorough understanding of ppis can provide more insights into cellular physiology at normal and disease states. although numerous methods have been proposed to predict ppis, it is still challenging for interaction prediction between unknown proteins. in this study, a novel neural network named aftgan was constructed to predict multi-type ppis. regarding feature input, esm-1b embedding containing much biological information for proteins was added as a protein sequence feature besides amino acid co-occurrence similarity and one-hot coding. an ensemble network was also constructed based on a transformer encoder containing an aft module (performing the weight operation on vital protein sequence feature information) and graph attention network (extracting the relational features of protein pairs) for the part of the network framework. results: the experimental results showed that the micro-f1 of the aftgan based on three partitioning schemes (bfs, dfs and the random mode) on the shs27k and shs148k datasets was 0.685, 0.711 and 0.867, as well as 0.745, 0.819 and 0.920, respectively, all higher than that of other popular methods. in addition, the experimental comparisons confirmed the performance superiority of the proposed model for predicting ppis of unknown proteins on the string dataset. availability and implementation: the source code is publicly available at https://github.com/1075793472/aftgan.",AB_0261
"object: motor imagery (mi) is a mental process widely utilized as the experimental paradigm for brain-computer interfaces (bcis) across a broad range of basic science and clinical studies. however, decoding intentions from mi remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of brain patterns relative to the small sample size available for machine learning. approach: this paper proposes an end-to-end filter-bank multiscale convolutional neural network (fbmsnet) for mi classification. a filter bank is first employed to derive a multiview spectral representation of the eeg data. mixed depthwise convolution is then applied to extract temporal features at multiple scales, followed by spatial filtering to mitigate volume conduction. finally, with the joint supervision of cross-entropy and center loss, fbmsnet obtains features that maximize interclass dispersion and intraclass compactness. main results: we compare fbmsnet with several state-of-the-art eeg decoding methods on two mi datasets: the bci competition iv 2a dataset and the openbmi dataset. fbmsnet significantly outperforms the benchmark methods by achieving 79.17% and 70.05% for four-class and two-class hold-out classification accuracy, respectively. significance: these results demonstrate the efficacy of fbmsnet in improving eeg decoding performance toward more robust bci applications. the fbmsnet source code is available at https://github.com/want2vanish/fbmsnet.",AB_0261
"image-based kinship verification is an important task in computer vision and has many applications in practice, such as missing children search and family album construction, among others. due to the differences in age, gender, expression and appearance, there usually exists a large discrepancy between the facial images of parent and child. this makes kinship verification a challenging task. in this article, we propose a distance and direction based deep discriminant metric learning ((dml)-m-4) approach for kinship verification. the basic idea of d4ml is to make full use of the discriminant information contained in the facial images of parent and child such that the network can learn more a discriminating distance metric. specifically, d4ml learns the metric by utilizing the discriminant information from two perspectives: distance-based perspective and direction-based perspective. from the distance-based perspective, the designed loss function is used to minimize the distance between images having kinship and maximize the distance between images without kinship. in practice, the gender difference and large age gap may significantly increase the distance between facial images of parent and child. therefore, learning the metric only from a distance-based perspective is insufficient. considering that two vectors with a large distance may appear with high similarity in direction, d4ml also employs the direction-based loss function in the training process. both kinds of loss function work together to improve the discriminability of the learned metric. experimental results on four small size publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. source code of our approach can be found at https://github.com/lclhenu/d4ml.",AB_0261
"glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that results in permanent vision loss, and the vertical cup to disc ratio (vcdr) in colour fundus images is essential in glaucoma screening and assessment. previous fully supervised convolution neural networks segment the optic disc (od) and optic cup (oc) from color fundus images and then calculate the vcdr offline. however, they rely on a large set of labeled masks for training, which is expensive and time-consuming to acquire. to address this, we propose a weakly and semi-supervised graph-based network that investigates geometric associations and domain knowledge between segmentation probability maps (pm), modified signed distance function representations (msdf), and boundary region of interest characteristics (b-roi) in three aspects. firstly, we propose a novel dual adaptive graph convolutional network (dagcn) to reason the long-range features of the pm and the msdf w.r.t. the regional uniformity. secondly, we propose a dual consistency regularization-based semi-supervised learning paradigm. the regional consistency between the pm and the msdf, and the marginal consistency between the derived b-roi from each of them boost the proposed model's performance due to the inherent geometric associations. thirdly, we exploit the task-specific domain knowledge via the oval shapes of od & oc, where a differentiable vcdr estimating layer is proposed. furthermore, without additional annotations, the supervision on vcdr serves as weakly-supervisions for segmentation tasks. experiments on six large-scale datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance on od & oc segmentation and vcdr estimation. the implementation code has been made available.https://github.com/smallmax00/dual_adaptive_graph_reasoning",AB_0261
"glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) is the most common type of brain tumors with high recurrence and mortality rates. after chemotherapy treatment, gbm patients still show a high rate of differentiating pseudoprogression (psp), which is often confused as true tumor progression (ttp) due to high phenotypical similarities. thus, it is crucial to construct an automated diagnosis model for differentiating between these two types of glioma progression. however, attaining this goal is impeded by the limited data availability and the high demand for interpretability in clinical settings. in this work, we propose an interpretable structure-constrained graph neural network (isgnn) with enhanced features to automatically discriminate between psp and ttp. this network employs a metric-based meta-learning strategy to aggregate class-specific graph nodes, focus on meta-tasks associated with various small graphs, thus improving the classification performance on small-scale datasets. specifically, a node feature enhancement module is proposed to account for the relative importance of node features and enhance their distinguishability through inductive learning. a graph generation constraint module enables learning reasonable graph structures to improve the efficiency of information diffusion while avoiding propagation errors. furthermore, model interpretability can be naturally enhanced based on the learned node features and graph structures that are closely related to the classification results. comprehensive experimental evaluation of our method demonstrated excellent interpretable results in the diagnosis of glioma progression. in general, our work provides a novel systematic gnn approach for dealing with data scarcity and enhancing decision interpretability. our source codes will be released at https://github.com/sjtubme-qianlab/gbm-gnn.",AB_0261
"in this work, we focus on the challenging task, neuro-disease classification, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri). in population graph-based disease analysis, graph convolutional neural networks (gcns) have achieved remarkable success. however, these achievements are inseparable from abundant labeled data and sensitive to spurious signals. to improve fmri representation learning and classification under a label-efficient setting, we propose a novel and theory-driven self-supervised learning (ssl) framework on gcns, namely graph cca for temporal self-supervised learning on fmri analysis (gate). concretely, it is demanding to design a suitable and effective ssl strategy to extract formation and robust features for fmri. to this end, we investigate several new graph augmentation strategies from fmri dynamic functional connectives (fc) for ssl training. further, we leverage canonical-correlation analysis (cca) on different temporal embeddings and present the theoretical implications. consequently, this yields a novel two-step gcn learning procedure comprised of (i) ssl on an unlabeled fmri population graph and (ii) fine-tuning on a small labeled fmri dataset for a classification task. our method is tested on two independent fmri datasets, demonstrating superior performance on autism and dementia diagnosis. our code is available at https://github.com/larryuestc/gate.",AB_0261
"for significant memory concern (smc) and mild cognitive impairment (mci), their classification performance is limited by confounding features, diverse imaging protocols, and limited sample size. to address the above limitations, we introduce a dual-modality fused brain connectivity network combining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) and diffusion tensor imaging (dti), and propose three mechanisms in the current graph convolutional network (gcn) to improve classifier performance. first, we introduce a dti-strength penalty term for constructing functional connectivity networks. stronger structural connectivity and bigger structural strength diversity between groups provide a higher opportunity for retaining connectivity information. second, a multi-center attention graph with each node representing a subject is proposed to consider the influence of data source, gender, acquisition equipment, and disease status of those training samples in gcn. the attention mechanism captures their different impacts on edge weights. third, we propose a multi-channel mechanism to improve filter performance, assigning different filters to features based on feature statistics. applying those nodes with low-quality features to perform convolution would also deteriorate filter performance. therefore, we further propose a pooling mechanism, which introduces the disease status information of those training samples to evaluate the quality of nodes. finally, we obtain the final classification results by inputting the multi-center attention graph into the multi-channel pooling gcn. the proposed method is tested on three datasets (i.e., an adni 2 dataset, an adni 3 dataset, and an in-house dataset). experimental results indicate that the proposed method is effective and superior to other related algorithms, with a mean classification accuracy of 93.05% in our binary classification tasks. our code is available at: https://github.com/xuegang-s.",AB_0261
"cerebrovascular segmentation from time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (tof-mra) is a critical step in computer-aided diagnosis. in recent years, deep learning models have proved its powerful feature extraction for cerebrovascular segmentation. however, they require many labeled datasets to implement effective driving, which are expensive and professional. in this paper, we propose a generative consistency for semi-supervised (gcs) model. considering the rich information contained in the feature map, the gcs model utilizes the generation results to constrain the segmentation model. the generated data comes from labeled data, unlabeled data, and unlabeled data after perturbation, respectively. the gcs model also calculates the consistency of the perturbed data to improve the feature mining ability. subsequently, we propose a new model as the backbone of the gsc model. it transfers tof-mra into graph space and establishes correlation using transformer. we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model on tof-mra representations, and tested the gcs model with state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods using the proposed model as backbone. the experiments prove the important role of the gcs model in cerebrovascular segmentation. code is available at https://github.com/montaellis/ssl-for-medical-segmentation.",AB_0261
"hyperspectral image super-resolution (hsi sr) is dramatically impacted by high spectral dimensionality, insufficient spatial resolution, and limited availability of training samples. current approaches mainly rely on complex data-driven models to address some of these challenges, and the characteristics of hsi are not fully considered in the model design. in this paper, we propose an efficient unfolding network with disentangled spatial-spectral representation (eunet) for hsi sr by combining domain knowledge (i.e., spectral correlation, degradation model, and structure prior) with deep learning. specifically, the optimization process of the superresolution prior-driven maximum a posterior (map) framework is unfolded into an interpretable multi-stage network, which inherits the advantages of deep learning-based image super-resolution (e.g., feature extraction in low-resolution space) and explicitly imposes the degradation model constraint. to well incorporate the structure prior of hsi, spatial and spectral feature extraction is disentangled by a variant of depthwise separable convolution, and spectral correlation is embedded by a lightweight spectral attention mechanism, so that the difficulty and computational complexity of feature learning are greatly reduced. experiments on benchmark datasets with different degradation models demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed eunet over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of evaluation metrics and computational complexity. the source code is available at https://github.com/denghong-liu/eunet.",AB_0261
