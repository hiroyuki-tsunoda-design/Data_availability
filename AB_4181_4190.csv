"backgroundhigh-throughput experiments provide deep insight into the molecular biology of different species, but more tools need to be developed to handle this type of data. at the transcriptomics level, quantitative polymerase chain reaction technology (qpcr) can be affordably adapted to produce high-throughput results through a single-cell approach. in addition to comparative expression profiles between groups, single-cell approaches allow us to evaluate and propose new dependency relationships among markers. however, this alternative has not been explored before for large-scale qpcr-based experiments.resultsherein, we present deltaxpress (delta xpress), a web app for analyzing data from single-cell qpcr experiments using a combination of html and r programming languages in a friendly environment. this application uses cycle threshold (ct) values and categorical information for each sample as input, allowing the best pair of housekeeping genes to be chosen to normalize the expression of target genes. delta xpress emulates a bulk analysis by observing differentially expressed genes, but in addition, it allows the discovery of pairwise genes differentially correlated when comparing two experimental conditions. researchers can download normalized data or use subsequent modules to map differentially correlated genes, perform conventional comparisons between experimental groups, obtain additional information about their genes (gene glossary), and generate ready-to-publication images (600 dots per inch).conclusions delta xpress web app is freely available to non-commercial users at https://alexismurillo.shinyapps.io/dxpress/ and can be used for different experiments in all technologies involving qpcr with at least one housekeeping region.",AB_0419
"the nature of dark matter is still unknown and an experimental program to look for dark matter particles in our galaxy should extend its sensitivity to light particles in the gev mass range and exploit the directional information of the dm particle motion (vahsen et al. in cygnus: feasibility of a nuclear recoil observatory with directional sensitivity to dark matter and neutrinos, arxiv:2008.12587, 2020). the cygno project is studying a gaseous time projection chamber operated at atmospheric pressure with a gas electron multiplier (sauli in nucl instrum meth a 386:531, )01172-2, 1997) amplification and with an optical readout as a promising technology for light dark matter and directional searches. in this paper we describe the operation of a 50 l prototype named lime (long imaging module) in an overground location at laboratori nazionali di frascati (lnf) of infn. this prototype employs the technology under study for the 1 cubic meter cygno demonstrator to be installed at the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso (lngs) (amaro et al. in instruments 2022, 6(1), https://www.mdpi.com/2410-390x/6/1/6, 2022). we report the characterization of lime with photon sources in the energy range from few kev to several tens of kev to understand the performance of the energy reconstruction of the emitted electron. we achieved a low energy threshold of few kev and an energy resolution over the whole energy range of 10-20%, while operating the detector for several weeks continuously with very high operational efficiency. the energy spectrum of the reconstructed electrons is then reported and will be the basis to identify radio-contaminants of the lime materials to be removed for future cygno detectors.",AB_0419

"objectiveatherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory process induced by the influx and entrapment of excess lipoproteins into the intima media of arteries. previously, our lab demonstrated that systemic ptp1b inhibition protects against atherosclerosis in preclinical ldlr-/- models. similarly, it was shown that myeloid-specific ptp1b ablation decreases plaque formation and ameliorates dyslipidaemia in the apoe-/- model of atherosclerosis. we hypothesized that the relevant improvements in dyslipidaemia following modification of ptp1b activation may either result from changes in hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis and/or increased uptake and degradation by liver-resident macrophages. we examined this in animal models and patients with coronary artery disease.methodsin this study, we determined the cholesterol-lowering effect of myeloid-ptp1b deletion in mice fed a high-fat high-cholesterol diet and examined effects on total cholesterol levels and lipoprotein profiles. we also determined the effects of ptp1b inhibition to oxldl-c challenge on foam cell formation and cholesterol efflux in human monocytes/macrophages.resultswe present evidence that myeloid-ptp1b deficiency significantly increases the affinity of kupffer cells for apob containing lipoproteins, in an il10-dependent manner. we also demonstrate that ptp1b inhibitor, msi-1436, treatment decreased foam cell formation in thp1-derived macrophages and increased macrophage cholesterol efflux to hdl in an ampk-dependent manner. we present evidence of three novel and distinct mechanisms regulated by ptp1b: an increase in cholesterol efflux from foam cells, decreased uptake of lipoproteins into intra-lesion macrophages in vitro and a decrease of circulating ldl-c and vldl-c in vivo.conclusionsoverall, these results suggest that myeloid-ptp1b inhibition has atheroprotective effects through improved cholesterol handling in atherosclerotic lesions, as well as increased reverse cholesterol transport.trial registration research registry, researchregistry 3235. registered 07 november 2017, https://www.researchregistry.com/browse-the-registry#home/registrationdetails/5a01d0fce7e1904e93e0aac5/.conclusionsoverall, these results suggest that myeloid-ptp1b inhibition has atheroprotective effects through improved cholesterol handling in atherosclerotic lesions, as well as increased reverse cholesterol transport.trial registration research registry, researchregistry 3235. registered 07 november 2017, https://www.researchregistry.com/browse-the-registry#home/registrationdetails/5a01d0fce7e1904e93e0aac5/.",AB_0419
"motivation: the nuclear pore complex (npc) is the only passageway for macromolecules between nucleus and cytoplasm, and an important reference standard in microscopy: it is massive and stereotypically arranged. the average architecture of npc proteins has been resolved with pseudoatomic precision, however observed npc heterogeneities evidence a high degree of divergence from this average. single-molecule localization microscopy (smlm) images npcs at protein-level resolution, whereupon image analysis software studies npc variability. however, the true picture of this variability is unknown. in quantitative image analysis experiments, it is thus difficult to distinguish intrinsically high smlm noise from variability of the underlying structure. results: we introduce cir4mics ('ceramics', configurable, irregular rings for microscopy simulations), a pipeline that synthesizes ground truth datasets of structurally variable npcs based on architectural models of the true npc. users can select one or more n- or c-terminally tagged npc proteins, and simulate a wide range of geometric variations. we also represent the npc as a spring-model such that arbitrary deforming forces, of user-defined magnitudes, simulate irregularly shaped variations. further, we provide annotated reference datasets of simulated human npcs, which facilitate a side-by-side comparison with real data. to demonstrate, we synthetically replicate a geometric analysis of real npc radii and reveal that a range of simulated variability parameters can lead to observed results. our simulator is therefore valuable to test the capabilities of image analysis methods, as well as to inform experimentalists about the requirements of hypothesis-driven imaging studies. availability and implementation: code: https://github.com/uhlmanngroup/cir4mics. simulated data: biostudies s-bsst1058.",AB_0419
"lipid analysis gained significant importance due to the enormous range of lipid functions, e.g., energy storage, signaling, or structural components. whole lipidomes can be quantitatively studied in-depth thanks to recent analytical advancements. however, the systematic comparison of thousands of distinct lipidomes remains challenging. we introduce lipidspace, a standalone tool for analyzing lipidomes by assessing their structural and quantitative differences. a graph-based comparison of lipid structures is the basis for calculating structural space models and subsequently computing lipidome similarities. when adding study variables such as body weight or health condition, lipidspace can determine lipid subsets across all lipidomes that describe these study variables well by utilizing machine-learning approaches. the user-friendly gui offers four built-in tutorials and interactive visual interfaces with pdf export. many supported data formats allow an efficient (re)analysis of data sets from different sources. an integrated interactive workflow guides the user through the quality control steps. we used this suite to reanalyze and combine already published data sets (e.g., one with about 2500 samples and 576 lipids in one run) and made additional discoveries to the published conclusions with the potential to fill gaps in the current lipid biology understanding. lipidspace is available for windows or linux (https://lifs-tools.org).",AB_0419
"ageing is accompanied by a multitude of changes in cognitive abilities, which in turn affect learning. learning collaboratively may benefit older adults by negating some of these age-related changes. however, studies on collaborative learning in older age differ in their methodology and findings. this systematic review provides an overview of the current research on collaborative learning in older age, exploring what factors influence collaborative learning in this age group. the titles and abstracts of imported 6629 works were screened, as well as four works added manually, which resulted in 29 studies. these studies were conducted across five countries (canada, united states, united kingdom, switzerland and belgium) between 1993 and 2023. most studies were quantitative with a non-randomized (n = 16) design. of the 29 studies, almost all studied collaboration in pairs (n = 28). the results suggest that the benefits of collaborating in older age may depend on the type of learning material, that familiarity between partners does not affect learning, and that age differences appear to decrease or disappear when older adults are provided with adequate time or trials. in addition, this systematic review identifies several gaps in the literature that future research should investigate further. this study was preregistered prior to its commencement on 21 january 2022. the accepted stage 1 manuscript, unchanged from the point of in-principle acceptance, may be viewed at https://osf.io/tj4w7/. the data and materials of this study can be found at https://osf.io/8xvqf/.",AB_0419
"the cases of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) are increasing rapidly around the world. due to the multifactorial causes of ibd, there is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of ibd. as such, the usage of high-throughput techniques to profile genetic mutations, microbiome environments, transcriptome and proteome (e.g. lipidome) is increasing to understand the molecular changes associated with ibd, including two major etiologies of ibd: crohn disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc). in the case of transcriptome data, rna sequencing (rna-seq) technique is used frequently. however, only protein-coding genes are analyzed, leaving behind all other rnas, including non-coding rnas (ncrnas) to be unexplored. among these ncrnas, long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) may hold keys to understand the pathogenesis of ibd as lncrnas are expressed in a cell/tissue-specific manner and dysregulated in a disease, such as ibd. however, it is rare that rna-seq data are analyzed for lncrnas. to fill this gap in knowledge, we re-analyzed rna-seq data of cd and uc patients compared with the healthy donors to dissect the expression profiles of lncrna genes. as inflammation plays key roles in the pathogenesis of ibd, we conducted loss-of-function experiments to provide functional data of ibd-specific lncrna, lung cancer associated transcript 1 (lucat1), in an in vitro model of macrophage polarization. to further facilitate the lncrna research in ibd, we built a web database, ibdb (https://ibd-db.shinyapps.io/ibdb/), to provide a one-stop-shop for expression profiling of protein-coding and lncrna genes in ibd patients compared with healthy donors.",AB_0419
