"aims/hypothesis repeated exposures to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in people with diabetes progressively impairs the counterregulatory response (crr) that restores normoglycaemia. this defect is characterised by reduced secretion of glucagon and other counterregulatory hormones. evidence indicates that glucose-responsive neurons located in the hypothalamus orchestrate the crr. here, we aimed to identify the changes in hypothalamic gene and protein expression that underlie impaired crr in a mouse model of defective crr.methods high-fat-diet fed and low-dose streptozocin-treated c57bl/6n mice were exposed to one (acute hypoglycaemia [ah]) or multiple (recurrent hypoglycaemia [rh]) insulin-induced hypoglycaemic episodes and plasma glucagon levels were measured. single-nuclei rna-seq (snrna-seq) data were obtained from the hypothalamus and cortex of mice exposed to ah and rh. proteomic data were obtained from hypothalamic synaptosomal fractions.results the final insulin injection resulted in similar plasma glucose levels in the rh group and ah groups, but glucagon secretion was significantly lower in the rh group (ah: 94.5 +/- 9.2 ng/l [n=33]; rh: 59.0 +/- 4.8 ng/l [n=37]; p<0.001). analysis of snrna-seq data revealed similar proportions of hypothalamic cell subpopulations in the ah- and rh-exposed mice. changes in transcriptional profiles were found in all cell types analysed. in neurons from rh-exposed mice, we observed a significant decrease in expression of avp, pmch and pcsk1n, and the most overexpressed gene was kcnq1ot1, as compared with ah-exposed mice. gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes (degs) indicated a coordinated decrease in many oxidative phosphorylation genes and reduced expression of vacuolar h+- and na+/k+-atpases; these observations were in large part confirmed in the proteomic analysis of synaptosomal fractions. compared with ah-exposed mice, oligodendrocytes from rh-exposed mice had major changes in gene expression that suggested reduced myelin formation. in astrocytes from rh-exposed mice, degs indicated reduced capacity for neurotransmitters scavenging in tripartite synapses as compared with astrocytes from ah-exposed mice. in addition, in neurons and astrocytes, multiple changes in gene expression suggested increased amyloid beta (a beta) production and stability. the snrna-seq analysis of the cortex showed that the adaptation to rh involved different biological processes from those seen in the hypothalamus.conclusions/interpretation the present study provides a model of defective counterregulation in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes. it shows that repeated hypoglycaemic episodes induce multiple defects affecting all hypothalamic cell types and their interactions, indicative of impaired neuronal network signalling and dysegulated hypoglycaemia sensing, and displaying features of neurodegenerative diseases. it also shows that repeated hypoglycaemia leads to specific molecular adaptation in the hypothalamus when compared with the cortex.data availabilitythe transcriptomic dataset is available via the geo (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), using the accession no. gse226277. the proteomic dataset is available via the proteomexchange data repository (http://www.proteomexchange.org), using the accession no. pxd040183.",AB_0417
"federated learning enables collaboration in medicine, where data is scattered across multiple centers without the need to aggregate the data in a central cloud. while, in general, machine learning models can be applied to a wide range of data types, graph neural networks (gnns) are particularly developed for graphs, which are very common in the biomedical domain. for instance, a patient can be represented by a protein-protein interaction (ppi) network where the nodes contain the patient-specific omics features. here, we present our ensemble-gnn software package, which can be used to deploy federated, ensemble-based gnns in python. ensemble-gnn allows to quickly build predictive models utilizing ppi networks consisting of various node features such as gene expression and/or dna methylation. we exemplary show the results from a public dataset of 981 patients and 8469 genes from the cancer genome atlas (tcga). availability and implementation: the source code is available at https://github.com/pievos101/ensemble-gnn, and the data at zenodo (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.8305122).",AB_0417

"backgroundthoracotomy is considered one of the most painful surgical procedures and can cause debilitating chronic post-surgical pain lasting months or years postoperatively. aggressive management of acute pain resulting from thoracotomy may reduce the likelihood of developing chronic pain. this trial compares the two most commonly used modes of acute analgesia provision at the time of thoracotomy (thoracic epidural blockade (teb) and paravertebral blockade (pvb)) in terms of their clinical and cost-effectiveness in preventing chronic post-thoracotomy pain.methodstopic 2 is a multi-centre, open-label, parallel group, superiority, randomised controlled trial, with an internal pilot investigating the use of teb and pvb in 1026 adult (>= 18 years old) patients undergoing thoracotomy in up to 20 thoracic centres throughout the uk. patients (n = 1026) will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either teb or pvb. during the first year, the trial will include an integrated quintet (qualitative research integrated into trials) recruitment intervention (qri) with the aim of optimising recruitment and informed consent. the primary outcome is the incidence of chronic post-surgical pain at 6 months post-randomisation defined as 'worst chest pain over the last week' equating to a visual analogue score greater than or equal to 40 mm indicating at least a moderate level of pain. secondary outcomes include acute pain, complications of regional analgesia and surgery, health-related quality of life, mortality and a health economic analysis.discussionboth teb and pvb have been demonstrated to be effective in the prevention of acute pain following thoracotomy and nationally practice is divided. identification of which mode of analgesia is both clinically and cost-effective in preventing chronic post-thoracotomy pain could ameliorate the debilitating effects of chronic pain, improving health-related quality of life, facilitating return to work and caring responsibilities and resulting in a cost saving to the nhs.trial registrationnct03677856 [clinicaltrials.gov] registered september 19, 2018. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03677856. first patient recruited 8 january 2019.",AB_0417

"traditional convolutional neural network (cnn) methods rely on dense tensors, which makes them suboptimal for spatially sparse data. in this paper, we propose a cnn model based on sparse tensors for efficient processing of high- resolution shapes represented as binary voxel occupancy grids. in contrast to a dense cnn that takes the entire voxel grid as input, a sparse cnn processes only on the non-empty voxels, thus reducing the memory and computation overhead caused by the sparse input data. we evaluate our method on two clinically relevant skull reconstruction tasks: (1) given a defective skull, reconstruct the complete skull (i.e., skull shape completion), and (2) given a coarse skull, reconstruct a high-resolution skull with fine geometric details (shape super-resolution). our method outperforms its dense cnn-based counterparts in the skull reconstruction task quantitatively and qualitatively, while requiring substantially less memory for training and inference. we observed that, on the 3d skull data, the overall memory consumption of the sparse cnn grows approximately linearly during inference with respect to the image resolutions. during training, the memory usage remains clearly below increases in image resolution-an x8 increase in voxel number leads to less than x4 increase in memory requirements. our study demonstrates the effectiveness of using a sparse cnn for skull reconstruction tasks, and our findings can be applied to other spatially sparse problems. we prove this by additional experimental results on other sparse medical datasets, like the aorta and the heart. project page at https://github.com/jianningli/sparsecnn.",AB_0417
"computational methods relying on protein structure strongly depend on the structure selected for investigation. typical sources of protein structures include experimental structures available at the protein data bank (pdb) and high-quality in silico model structures, such as those available at the alphafold protein structure database. either option has significant advantages and drawbacks, and exploring the wealth of available structures to identify the most suitable ones for specific applications can be a daunting task. we provide an open-source software package, pdbminer, with the purpose of making structure identification and selection easier, faster, and less error prone. pdbminer searches the alphafold database and the pdb for available structures of interest and provides an up-to-date, quality-ranked table of structures applicable for further use. pdbminer provides an overview of the available protein structures to one or more input proteins, parallelizing the runs if multiple cores are specified. the output table reports the coverage of the protein structures aligned to the uniprot sequence, overcoming numbering differences in pdb structures and providing information regarding model quality, protein complexes, ligands, and nucleic acid chain binding. the pdbminer2coverage and pdbminer2network tools assist in visualizing the results. pdbminer can be applied to overcome the tedious task of choosing a pdb structure without losing the wealth of additional information available in the pdb. here, we showcase the main functionalities of the package on the p53 tumor suppressor protein. the package is available at http://github.com/elelab/pdbminer.",AB_0417
"backgroundthe hallmark symptom of heart failure (hf) is severe exercise intolerance. fortunately, accumulated evidence suggests that exercise programs improve physical performance, enhance autonomy in daily activities and quality of life, and reduce cardiovascular and other hospitalizations. recently, experimental studies have explored the application of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, especially transcranial direct current stimulation (tdcs), aiming to improve physical performance due to its ability to modulate brain functioning. the primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the effects of anodal tdcs associated with aerobic exercise on the functional capacity of patients with hf with reduced ejection fraction (hfref). secondary objectives are to compare the effects of tdcs associated with aerobic exercise vs. sham-tdcs associated with aerobic exercise on cardiopulmonary exercise capacity; inflammatory cytokines; and quality of life.methodsthis is a two-arm, prospectively registered, randomized trial with concealed allocation, double-blind, and intention-to-treat analysis. forty-four patients with hfref will be recruited. the experimental group will undertake 25-30 min aerobic exercise training associated with tdcs, for 4 weeks. the control group will undergo the same aerobic exercise training, but with sham-tdcs. the primary outcome will be functional performance by the 6-min walk test. secondary outcomes will include cardiopulmonary exercise capacity, inflammatory cytokines, and quality of life. outcomes will be collected by a researcher blinded to group allocation at baseline (t0) and after 4 weeks of intervention (t1).discussionalthough previous studies have investigated the combined effect of tdcs on t3 area and physical performance and have suggested that tdcs could have reduced ratings of perceived exertion by affecting the activity of the insular cortex, and therefore increase exercise tolerance, this study is the first to evaluate the effects of the addition of anodal tdcs to aerobic exercise training for improving physical and functional performance, decreasing the perceived exertion, altering the quantification of inflammatory cytokines, and improving the subclinical values of the cardiopulmonary test in patients with hfref, which could result in an important advance in cardiac rehabilitation for patients with chronic hf.trial registrationbrazilian registry of clinical trials (rebec) rbr-10w787j6. registered on 25 april 2023. https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/pesquisador",AB_0417
"the challenge of re-identifying vehicles in urban city surveillance systems and major traffic arteries such as highways and roads is an important area of research. the advent of large-scale benchmarks such as veri-776 and vehicle-id has propelled efforts to enhance search operations from large databases for re-identification. however, several unresolved challenges associated with vehicle re-identification in unconstrained environments remain to be explored. in order to foster research in this field, we have compiled a new multi-perspective dataset, pakvehicle-reid, captured by real-world surveillance cameras in urban cities of the developing country of pakistan. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first such dataset collected under unconstrained conditions in a developing asian region. the dataset comprises 80,000 images of 20,000 unique vehicles. additionally, a deep learning-based technique for extracting multi-dimensional robust features for vehicle re-identification using convolutional neural networks has been proposed. the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method on the pakvehicle-reid dataset as well as on two other existing datasets, veri-776 and vehicleid. the code and link to the dataset can be obtained from the following github repository: https://github.com/vision-at-seecs/pakvehiclereid.",AB_0417
