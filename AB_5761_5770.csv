"humans and animals are regularly exposed to compoundsthat mayhave adverse effects on health. the toxicity forecaster (toxcast)program was developed to use high throughput screening assays to quicklyscreen chemicals by measuring their effects on many biological endpoints. many of these assays test for effects on cellular receptorsand transcription factors (tfs), under the assumption that a toxicantmay perturb normal signaling pathways in the cell. we hypothesizedthat we could reconstruct the intermediate proteins in these pathwaysthat may be directly or indirectly affected by the toxicant, potentiallyrevealing important physiological processes not yet tested for manychemicals. we integrate data from toxcast with a human protein interactometo build toxicant signaling networks that contain physical and signalingprotein interactions that may be affected as a result of toxicantexposure. to build these networks, we developed the edgelinker algorithm,which efficiently finds short paths in the interactome that connectthe receptors to tfs for each toxicant. we performed multiple evaluationsand found evidence suggesting that these signaling networks capturebiologically relevant effects of toxicants. to aid in disseminationand interpretation, interactive visualizations of these networks areavailable at http://graphspace.org.",AB_0577
"calling tandem repeat (tr) variants from dna sequences is of both theoretical and practical significance. some bioinformatics tools have been developed for detecting or genotyping trs. however, little study has been done to genotyping tr alleles from long-read sequencing data, and the accuracy of genotyping tr alleles from next-generation sequencing data still needs to be improved. herein, a novel algorithm is described to retrieve tr regions from sequence alignment, and a software program trcaller has been developed and integrated into a web portal to call tr alleles from both short- and long-read sequences, both whole genome and targeted sequences generated from multiple sequencing platforms. all tr alleles are genotyped as haplotypes and the robust alleles will be reported, even multiple alleles in a dna mixture. trcaller could provide substantially higher accuracy (>99% in 289 human individuals) in detecting tr alleles with magnitudes faster (e.g., similar to 2 s for 300x human sequence data) than the mainstream software tools. the web portal preselected 119 tr loci from forensics, genealogy, and disease related tr loci. trcaller is validated to be scalable in various applications, such as dna forensics and disease diagnosis, which can be expanded into other fields like breeding programs. availability: trcaller is available at https://www.trcaller.com/signin.aspx.",AB_0577
"with the rapid growth of iot multimedia devices, more and more content is being delivered in multimedia forms which generally requires more effort and resources from users to create and could be challenging to streamline. in this article, we propose text2animation (t2a), a framework that helps to generate complex multimedia content, and animation, from the simple textual script input. by leveraging recent advances in computational cinematography and video understanding, the purposed workflow further reduces associated knowledge requirements dramatically for cinematography. by jointly incorporating the fidelity and aesthetic models, t2a jointly considers the comprehensiveness of the visual presentation of the input script and the compliance of generated video with given cinematography specifications. the virtual camera placement in a 3-d environment is mapped into an optimization problem that can be resolved by using dynamic programming to achieve the lowest computational complexity. experimental results show that t2a can reduce the manual animation production process by around 74%, and the new optimization framework can improve the perceptual quality of the output video by up to 35%. more video footage can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmtjbmwl3gs.",AB_0577
"the quasi-harmonic approximation (qha) is a powerful method that uses the volume dependence of non-interacting phonons to compute the free energy of materials at high pressures (p) and temperatures (t ). however, anharmonicity, electronic excitations in metals, or both, introduce an intrinsic t-dependence on phonon frequencies, rendering the qha inadequate. here we present a python code, pgm, to compute the free energy and thermodynamic property within the phonon gas model (pgm) that uses t-dependent phonon quasiparticle frequencies. in this case, the vibrational contribution to the helmholtz free energy is obtained by integrating the vibrational entropy, which can be readily calculated for a system of phonon quasiparticles. other thermodynamic properties are then obtained from standard thermodynamic relations. we demonstrate the successful applications of pgm to two cases of geophysical significance: cubic casio3-perovskite (ccapv), a strongly anharmonic insulator and the third most abundant phase of the earth's lower mantle, and nias-type (b8) feo, a partially covalent-metallic system. this is the oxide endmember of a recently discovered iron-rich feno alloy phase likely to exist in the earth's inner core. program summary program title: pgm cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /8rfw6syvzp .1 developer's repository link: https://github .com /mineralscloud /pgm licensing provisions: gnu general public license 3 programming language: python3 nature of problem: the classic quasi-harmonic approximation (qha) method to compute the vibrational free energy does not apply to physical systems when phonon frequencies have an intrinsic and non-negligible temperature (t ) dependence. examples are anharmonic systems or metals with abundant electronic thermal excitations. both cases introduce an intrinsic t-dependence on phonon frequencies. solution method: the method implemented in pgm is based on the phonon gas model where the entropy is well defined for t-dependent phonon quasiparticle. the free energy is calculated by integrating the entropy, making it suitable for anharmonic systems or systems with extensive thermal electronic excitations affecting phonon frequencies. the static free energy, the vibrational density of states (vdos), and the entropy are first computed on sparse t- and p-grids. the entropy is then suitably interpolated on denser user-specified grids for integration. additional comments, including restrictions and unusual features: the package allows it to be run directly in the command line. it can also be incorporated into other programs. we implemented just-in-time (jit) compiling and parallel computing techniques [1] in pgm python code to speed up the numerical calculation. & copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0577
"relativealchemical binding free energy calculations are routinelyused in drug discovery projects to optimize the affinity of smallmolecules for their drug targets. alchemical methods can also be usedto estimate the impact of amino acid mutations on protein:proteinbinding affinities, but these calculations can involve sampling challengesdue to the complex networks of protein and water interactions frequentlypresent in protein:protein interfaces. we investigate these challengesby extending a graphics processing unit (gpu)-accelerated open-sourcerelative free energy calculation package (perses) to predict the impactof amino acid mutations on protein:protein binding. using the well-characterizedmodel system barnase:barstar, we describe analyses for identifyingand characterizing sampling problems in protein:protein relative freeenergy calculations. we find that mutations with sampling problemsoften involve charge-changes, and inadequate sampling can be attributedto slow degrees of freedom that are mutation-specific. we also explorethe accuracy and efficiency of current state-of-the-art approaches alchemicalreplica exchange and alchemical replica exchange with solute tempering forovercoming relevant sampling problems. by employing sufficiently longsimulations, we achieve accurate predictions (rmse 1.61, 95% ci: [1.12,2.11] kcal/mol), with 86% of estimates within 1 kcal/mol of the experimentallydetermined relative binding free energies and 100% of predictionscorrectly classifying the sign of the changes in binding free energies.ultimately, we provide a model workflow for applying protein mutationfree energy calculations to protein:protein complexes, and importantly,catalog the sampling challenges associated with these types of alchemicaltransformations. our free open-source package (perses) is based onopenmm and is available at https://github.com/choderalab/perses.",AB_0577
"non-floodplain wetlands - those located outside the floodplains - have emerged as integral components to watershed resilience, contributing hydrologic and biogeochemical functions affecting watershedscale flooding extent, drought magnitude, and water-quality maintenance. however, the absence of a global dataset of non-floodplain wetlands limits their necessary incorporation into water quality and quantity management decisions and affects wetland-focused wildlife habitat conservation outcomes. we addressed this critical need by developing a publicly available global nfw (non-floodplain wetland) dataset, comprised of a global river-floodplain map at 90m resolution coupled with a global ensemble wetland map incorporating multiple wetland-focused data layers. the floodplain, wetland, and non-floodplain wetland spatial data developed here were successfully validated within 21 large and heterogenous basins across the conterminous united states. we identified nearly 33 million potential non-floodplain wetlands with an estimated global extent of over 16 x 106 km(2). non-floodplain wetland pixels comprised 53% of globally identified wetland pixels, meaning the majority of the globe's wetlands likely occur external to river floodplains and coastal habitats. the identified global nfws were typically small (median 0.039 km(2)), with a global median size ranging from 0.018-0.138 km(2). this novel geospatial global nfw static dataset advances wetland conservation and resource-management goals while providing a foundation for global non-floodplain wetland functional assessments, facilitating non-floodplain wetland inclusion in hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological model development. the data are freely available through the united states environmental protection agency's environmental dataset gateway (https://gaftp.epa.gov/epadatacommons/ord/global_nonfloodplain_wetlands/, last access: 24 may 2023) and through  (lane et al., 2023a).",AB_0577
"background: some patients prescribed opioid analgesic (oa) medications for pain experience serious side effects, including dependence, sedation, and overdose. as most patients are at low risk for oa-related harms, risk reduction interventions requiring multiple counseling sessions are impractical on a large scale. objective: this study evaluates whether an intervention based on reinforcement learning (rl), a field of artificial intelligence, learned through experience to personalize interactions with patients with pain discharged from the emergency department (ed) and decreased self-reported oa misuse behaviors while conserving counselors' time. methods: we used data representing 2439 weekly interactions between a digital health intervention (prescription opioid wellness and engagement research in the ed [powered]) and 228 patients with pain discharged from 2 eds who reported recent opioid misuse. during each patient's 12 weeks of intervention, powered used rl to select from 3 treatment options: a brief motivational message delivered via an interactive voice response (ivr) call, a longer motivational ivr call, or a live call from a counselor. the algorithm selected session types for each patient each week, with the goal of minimizing oa risk, defined in terms of a dynamic score reflecting patient reports during ivr monitoring calls. when a live counseling call was predicted to have a similar impact on future risk as an ivr message, the algorithm favored ivr to conserve counselor time. we used logit models to estimate changes in the relative frequency of each session type as powered gained experience. poisson regression was used to examine the changes in self-reported oa risk scores over calendar time, controlling for the ordinal session number (1st to 12th). results: participants on average were 40 (sd 12.7) years of age; 66.7% (152/228) were women and 51.3% (117/228) were unemployed. most participants (175/228, 76.8%) reported chronic pain, and 46.2% (104/225) had moderate to severe depressive symptoms. as powered gained experience through interactions over a period of 142 weeks, it delivered fewer live counseling sessions than brief ivr sessions (p=.006) and extended ivr sessions (p<.001). live counseling sessions were selected 33.5% of the time in the first 5 weeks of interactions (95% ci 27.4%-39.7%) but only for 16.4% of sessions (95% ci 12.7%-20%) after 125 weeks. controlling for each patient's changes during the course of treatment, this adaptation of treatment-type allocation led to progressively greater improvements in self-reported oa risk scores (p<.001) over calendar time, as measured by the number of weeks since enrollment began. improvement in risk behaviors over time was especially pronounced among patients with the highest risk at baseline (p=.02). conclusions: the rl-supported program learned which treatment modalities worked best to improve self-reported oa risk behaviors while conserving counselors' time. rl-supported interventions represent a scalable solution for patients with pain receiving oa prescriptions. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02990377; https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct02990377",AB_0577
"deepfakes, or synthetic audiovisual media developed with the intent to deceive, are growing increasingly prevalent. existing methods, employed independently as images/patches or jointly as tubelets, have, up to this point, typically focused on spatial or spatiotemporal inconsistencies. however, the evolving nature of deepfakes demands a holistic approach. inspection of a given multimedia sample with the intent to validate its authenticity, without adding significant computational overhead has, to date, not been fully explored in the literature. in addition, no work has been done on the impact of different inconsistency dimensions in a single framework. this paper tackles the deepfake detection problem holistically. holisticdfd, a novel, transformerbased, deepfake detection method which is both lightweight and compact, intelligently combines embeddings from the spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal dimensions to separate deepfakes from bonafide videos. the proposed framework achieves 0.926 auc on the dfdc dataset using just 3% of the parameters used by state-of-the-art detectors. an evaluation against other datasets shows the efficacy of the proposed framework, and an ablation study shows that the performance of the system gradually improves as embeddings with different data representations are combined. an implementation of the proposed framework is available at: https://github.com/smileslab/ deepfake-detection/.",AB_0577
"zapdos is an open-source finite element plasma fluid solver based on the moose multiphysics framework. this paper outlines zapdos verification, benchmarking, and validation efforts for 1d and 2d rf capacitively-coupled plasma discharge models for mid-range pressures (0.1 - 1 torr). the verification process involved using the method of manufactured solutions to assess zapdos spatial and temporal error convergence. l2 errors ranged from 10-2 to 10-4, while the convergence's slope were in agreement with the predicted slopes for the tested variable and time integration orders. the benchmarking process involved comparisons to previously results from the validated finite element code, lsodi [1-3]. these works included 1d and 2d simulations for a range of plasma parameters (densities, temperatures, voltage, etc.). for the 1d cases, zapdos and lsodi results were in very good agreement. in the 2d cases, variable behaviors matched, with slight discrepancies in peak values. the validation process involved comparisons to experimental works including electron density measurements by microwave interferometry [4] and metastable density measurements by planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging [5]. results shown reasonable agreement at higher pressure, with results starting to diverge at low pressures. probable causes for this diverges are the limitation of the fluid assumption for plasmas at low pressure, or the need for more robust boundary conditions. overall, zapdos shown reasonable results for the verification, benchmarking, and validation efforts, and zapdos can be downloaded at https:// github .com /shannon -lab /zapdos. program summary program title: zapdos cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /j76jr9m66p .1 developer's repository link: https://github .com /shannon -lab /zapdos licensing provisions: lgpl-2.1 programming language: c++, python supplementary material: shannon -lab .github .io /zapdos nature of problem: for the plasma computational community, multiphysics packages are needed for the highly couple physics seen in plasma problems (e.g. chemistry, fluid flow, heat transfer, electromagnetic, etc.). one limiting factor for these types of computational research is the high cost to purchase the licenses needed for established multiphysics packages, such as comsol. an additional problem that can arise is the limited ability to add new physics to these existing frameworks, in such a way that new physics can be easily coupled to current models. for any new software that wants to tackle these problems, the question of verification and validation for these codes needs to be addressed. solution method: zapdos is an open-source finite element plasma fluid solver based on the moose multiphysics framework. moose (multiphysics object oriented simulation environment) solves highly nonlinear, tightly coupled sets of partial differential equations (pdes) and houses multiple physics applications that can be easily coupled together. zapdos, along with the moose ecosystem, is all free, open-source, and completing customizable with no black box components. zapdos has gone through verification and validation for applications common in the plasma computational community. additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: zapdos, along with moose and other moose applications, require an unix based operating system. & copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0577
"background: eating disorders (ed) affect up to 5% of youth and are associated with reward system alterations and compulsive behaviors. naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, is used to treat ed behaviors such as binge eating and/or purging. the presumed mechanism of action is blockade of reward activation; however, not all patients respond, and the optimal dose is unknown. developing a tool to detect objective drug response in the brain will facilitate drug development and therapeutic optimization. this pilot study evaluated neuroimaging as a pharmacodynamic biomarker of opioid antagonism in adolescents with ed. methods: youth aged 13-21 with binge/purge ed completed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) pre- and post-oral naltrexone. fmri detected blood oxygenation-level dependent (bold) signal at rest and during two reward probes (monetary incentive delay, mid, and passive food view, pfv) in predefined regions of interest associated with reward and inhibitory control. effect sizes for delta%bold (post-naltrexone vs. baseline) were estimated using linear mixed effects modeling. results: in 12 youth (16-21years, 92% female), bold signal changes were detected following naltrexone in the nucleus accumbens during pfv (delta%bold -0.08 +/- 0.03; cohen's d -1.06, p=0.048) and anterior cingulate cortex during mid (delta%bold 0.06 +/- 0.03; cohen's d 1.25, p=0.086). conclusion: fmri detected acute reward pathway modulation in this small sample of adolescents with binge/purge ed. if validated in future, larger trials, task-based delta%bold detected by fmri may serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker of opioid antagonism to facilitate the development of novel therapeutics targeting the reward pathway, enable quantitative pharmacology trials, and inform drug dosing. clinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04935931, nct#04935931.",AB_0577
