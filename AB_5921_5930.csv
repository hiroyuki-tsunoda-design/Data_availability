"the corona virus pandemic has introduced limitations which were previously not a cause for concern. chief among them are wearing face masks in public and constraints on the physical distance between people as an effective measure to reduce the virus spread. visual surveillance systems, which are common in urban environments and initially commissioned for security surveillance, can be re-purposed to help limit the spread of covid-19 and prevent future pandemics. in this work, we propose a novel integration technique for real-time pose estimation and multiple human tracking in a pedestrian setting, primarily for social distancing, using cctv camera footage. our technique promises a sizeable increase in processing speed and improved detection in very low-resolution scenarios. using existing surveillance systems, pedestrian pose estimation, tracking and localization for social distancing (petl4sd) is proposed for measuring social distancing, which combines the output of multiple neural networks aided with fundamental 2d/3d vision techniques. we leverage state-of-the-art object and pose estimation algorithms, combining their strengths, for increase in speed and improvement in detections. these detections are then tracked using a bespoke version of the fastmot algorithm. temporal and analogous estimation techniques are used to deal with occlusions when estimating posture. projective geometry along with the aforementioned posture tracking is then used to localize the pedestrians. inter-personal distances are calculated and locally inspected to detect possible violations of the social distancing rules. furthermore, a smart violations detector is employed which estimates if people are together based on their current actions and eliminates false social distancing violations within groups. finally, distances are intuitively visualized with the right perspective. all implementation is in real time and is performed on python. experimental results are provided to validate our proposed method quantitatively and qualitatively on public domain datasets using only a single cctv camera feed as input. our results show our technique to outperform the baseline in speed and accuracy in low-resolution scenarios. the code of this work will be made publicly available on github at https://github.com/bilalze/petl4sd.",AB_0593
"background: the standard of care for surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis is restorative proctocolectomy with ileal j-pouch. leaks from the tip of the j-pouch are a known complication, but there is a paucity of literature regarding this type of leak. objective: we aimed to describe the diagnosis, management, and long-term clinical outcomes of leaks from the tip of the j-pouch at our institution. design: this was a retrospective study of a prospectively maintained pouch registry. setting: this study was conducted at a quaternary ibd referral center. patients: patients included those with ileal j-pouches diagnosed with leaks from the tip of the j-pouch. main outcome measures: the main measures of outcomes were pouch salvage rate, type of salvage procedures, and long-term kaplan-meier pouch survival. results: we identified 74 patients with leaks from the tip of the j-pouch. pain (68.9%) and pelvic abscess (40.9%) were the most common presentations, whereas 10.8% of patients presented with an acute abdomen. the leak was diagnosed by imaging and/or endoscopy in 74.3% of patients but only discovered during surgical exploration in 25.6% of patients. some 63.5% of patients were diagnosed only after loop ileostomy closure, whereas 32.4% of patients were diagnosed before ileostomy closure. the most common methods used for diagnosis were pouchoscopy (31.1%) and gastrograffin enema (28.4%). a definitive nonoperative approach was attempted in 48.6% of patients but was successful in only 10.8% of patients overall. surgical repair was attempted in 89.2% of patients, whereas 4.5% of patients had pouch excision. salvage operations (n = 63) included sutured or stapled repair of the tip of the j (65%), pouch excision with neo-pouch (25.4%), and pouch disconnection, repair, and reanastomosis (9.5%). ultimately, 10 patients (13.5%) required pouch excision, yielding an overall 5-year pouch survival rate of 86.3%. limitations: this was a retrospective review; referral bias may limit the generalizability. conclusions: leaks from the tip of the j-pouch have variable clinical presentations and require a high index of suspicion. pouch salvage surgery is required in the majority of patients and is associated with a high pouch salvage rate. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c50.",AB_0593
"interpretation of genomics data is critically reliant on the application of a wide range of visualization tools. a large number of visualization techniques for genomics data and different analysis tasks pose a significant challenge for analysts: which visualization technique is most likely to help them generate insights into their data? since genomics analysts typically have limited training in data visualization, their choices are often based on trial and error or guided by technical details, such as data formats that a specific tool can load. this approach prevents them from making effective visualization choices for the many combinations of data types and analysis questions they encounter in their work. visualization recommendation systems assist non-experts in creating data visualization by recommending appropriate visualizations based on the data and task characteristics. however, existing visualization recommendation systems are not designed to handle domain-specific problems. to address these challenges, we designed genorec, a novel visualization recommendation system for genomics. genorec enables genomics analysts to select effective visualizations based on a description of their data and analysis tasks. here, we present the recommendation model that uses a knowledge-based method for choosing appropriate visualizations and a web application that enables analysts to input their requirements, explore recommended visualizations, and export them for their usage. furthermore, we present the results of two user studies demonstrating that genorec recommends visualizations that are both accepted by domain experts and suited to address the given genomics analysis problem. all supplemental materials are available at https://osf.io/y73pt/.",AB_0593
"background: preoperative chemoradiation is indicated for clinical stage ii and iii rectal cancers; however, the accuracy of clinical staging with preoperative imaging is imperfect. objective: the study aimed to better characterize the incidence and management of clinical and pathologic stage discordances in patients who did not receive preoperative chemoradiation. design: this was a retrospective cohort analysis. settings: the source of data was the national cancer database from 2006 to 2015. patients: we identified patients who underwent resection with curative intent for clinical stage i rectal adenocarcinoma without preoperative chemotherapy or radiation. main outcome measures: we evaluated the characteristics of upstaged patients-those with t3/t4 tumors found on pathology (pathologic stage ii) and/or with positive regional nodes in the resection specimen (pathologic stage iii) compared with those patients who were not upstaged (pathologic stage i). we then used a mixed-effects multivariable survival model to compare overall survival between these groups. results: among 7818 clinical stage i rectal cancer patients who did not receive preoperative therapy, tumor upstaging occurred in 819 (10.6%) and nodal upstaging occurred in 1612 (20.8%). upstaged patients were more likely than those not upstaged to have higher grade tumors and positive margins. survival was worse in upstaged patients (hazard ratio [hr], 1.64; 95% ci, 1.4-1.9) but improved among those upstaged patients who received either chemotherapy (hr, 0.71; 95% ci, 0.6-0.9) or chemoradiation (hr, 0.62; 95% ci, 0.5-0.7). limitations: in addition to the inherent limitations of a retrospective cohort study, the national cancer database does not record functional outcomes, local recurrence, or disease-specific survival, so we are restricted to the evaluation of overall survival as an oncologic outcome. conclusions: inaccurate preoperative staging remains a common clinical challenge in the management of rectal cancer. survival among upstaged patients is improved among those who receive recommended postoperative chemotherapy and/or chemoradiation, yet many patients do not receive guideline-concordant care. see video abstract at https://links.lww.com/dcr/b999.",AB_0593
"graph neural networks (gnns) have proved to be an effective representation learning framework for graph-structured data, and have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many practical predictive tasks, such as node classification, link prediction and graph classification. among the variants of gnns, graph attention networks (gats) learn to assign dense attention coefficients over all neighbors of a node for feature aggregation, and improve the performance of many graph learning tasks. however, real-world graphs are often very large and noisy, and gats are prone to overfitting if not regularized properly. even worse, the local aggregation mechanism of gats may fail on disassortative graphs, where nodes within local neighborhood provide more noise than useful information for feature aggregation. in this paper, we propose sparse graph attention networks (sgats) that learn sparse attention coefficients under an $l_0$l0-norm regularization, and the learned sparse attentions are then used for all gnn layers, resulting in an edge-sparsified graph. by doing so, we can identify noisy/task-irrelevant edges, and thus perform feature aggregation on most informative neighbors. extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world (assortative and disassortative) graph learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of sgats. in particular, sgats can remove about 50-80 percent edges from large assortative graphs, such as ppi and reddit, while retaining similar classification accuracies. on disassortative graphs, sgats prune majority of noisy edges and outperform gats in classification accuracies by significant margins. furthermore, the removed edges can be interpreted intuitively and quantitatively. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first graph learning algorithm that shows significant redundancies in graphs and edge-sparsified graphs can achieve similar (on assortative graphs) or sometimes higher (on disassortative graphs) predictive performances than original graphs. our code is available at https://github.com/yangyeeee/sgat.",AB_0593
"background: surgical treatment of recurrent rectovaginal fistulas is notoriously difficult. placement of the gracilis muscle between the vagina and anus is an advanced technique used to close persistent fistulas. we have utilized this procedure for recalcitrant fistulas and hypothesized that a gracilis interposition would offer a good treatment option for patients with refractory rectovaginal fistulas, regardless of underlying etiology. objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate healing rates of gracilis interposition in patients with refractory rectovaginal fistulas. design: following institutional review board approval, a retrospective review of all adult female patients with a diagnosis of rectovaginal fistula between january 2009 and august 2020 was performed; those who underwent gracilis interposition for definitive fistula closure were included for analysis. settings: the study was conducted at a colorectal surgery department at a tertiary center in the united states. patients: all patients were adult females with a diagnosis of a rectovaginal fistula who underwent gracilis interposition for definitive closure. main outcome measures: patient demographics, etiology of rectovaginal fistula, previous surgical intervention, presence of intestinal diversion, operative details, 30-day morbidity, recurrence of fistula, and time to recurrence. fistula closure was defined as lack of clinical symptoms following stoma closure, negative fistula detection on gastrograffin enema, and absence of an internal opening at examination under anesthesia. results: twenty-two patients were included who had a median age of 43 years (range, 19-64 years) and median body mass index of 31kg/m(2) (range, 22-51). median time between prior attempted surgical repair and gracilis surgery was 7 months (range, 3-17). the number of previously attempted repairs were 1-2 (n = 8), 3-4 (n = 9), and > 4 (n = 5). the most recent attempted surgical repair was rectal advancement flap (n = 7), transperineal +/- martius flap (n = 4), episioproctotomy (n = 3), transvaginal repair (n = 2), and other (n = 6). all patients had fecal diversion at the time of gracilis surgery. thirty-day postoperative surgical site infection at the graft/donor site was 32% (n = 7). at a median follow-up of 22 months (range 2-62), fistula closure was 59% (n = 13). gracilis interposition was successful in all inflammatory bowel disease patients. limitations: the study was limited by its retrospective nature. conclusions: gracilis interposition is an effective operative technique for reoperative rectovaginal fistula closure. patients should be counseled regarding the possibility of graft/donor site infection. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b763.",AB_0593
"background: right hemicolectomy is recommended for appendiceal adenocarcinoma but may not be needed for early stage disease. objective: this study aimed to determine whether appendectomy offers adequate oncologic outcomes for t1 appendiceal adenocarcinoma from a national cohort of patients. design: patients with t1 appendiceal adenocarcinoma (mucinous and nonmucinous histology) treated with either a right hemicolectomy or appendectomy between 2004 and 2016 were retrieved. multivariate cox regression analysis was used to identify predictors of overall survival. setting: the study was conducted using a national cancer database. patients: a total of 320 patients (median age, 62 y; 47% women) were identified: 69 (22%) underwent an appendectomy and 251 (78%) underwent a right hemicolectomy. main outcome measure: overall survival was measured. results: nonmucinous adenocarcinoma was identified in 194 (61%), whereas 126 (39%) had mucinous adenocarcinoma. of the overall cohort, 43% had well-differentiated histology, 39% had moderately differentiated disease, and 4% had poorly differentiated tumors. the rate of lymph node metastasis was lower in well-differentiated tumors (3%) compared with moderately (10%) or poorly differentiated tumors (25%). on univariate survival analysis, right hemicolectomy was associated with improved 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival in patients with moderately/poorly differentiated disease (p < 0.001) but not for well-differentiated disease (p = 1.000). after adjustment, right hemicolectomy was associated with overall survival improvement for moderately/poorly differentiated t1 adenocarcinoma (hr = 0.26 [95% ci, 0.08-0.82]; p = 0.02) but not for well-differentiated disease. limitations: this study was limited by its retrospective nature. conclusions: the current analysis from the national cancer database demonstrates that appendectomy is associated with equivalent survival to right hemicolectomy for well-differentiated t1 adenocarcinoma, whereas for moderately and poorly differentiated disease, right hemicolectomy is oncologically superior to appendectomy. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b689.",AB_0593
"motivation developing biochemical models in systems biology is a complex, knowledge-intensive activity. some modelers (especially novices) benefit from model development tools with a graphical user interface. however, as with the development of complex software, text-based representations of models provide many benefits for advanced model development. at present, the tools for text-based model development are limited, typically just a textual editor that provides features such as copy, paste, find, and replace. since these tools are not model aware, they do not provide features for: (i) model building such as autocompletion of species names; (ii) model analysis such as hover messages that provide information about chemical species; and (iii) model translation to convert between model representations. we refer to these as bat features.results we present vscode-antimony, a tool for building, analyzing, and translating models written in the antimony modeling language, a human readable representation of systems biology markup language (sbml) models. vscode-antimony is a source editor, a tool with language-aware features. for example, there is autocompletion of variable names to assist with model building, hover messages that aid in model analysis, and translation between xml and antimony representations of sbml models. these features result from making vscode-antimony model-aware by incorporating several sophisticated capabilities: analysis of the antimony grammar (e.g. to identify model symbols and their types); a query system for accessing knowledge sources for chemical species and reactions; and automatic conversion between different model representations (e.g. between antimony and sbml).availability and implementation vscode-antimony is available as an open source extension in the vscode marketplace https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=stevem.vscode-antimony. source code can be found at https://github.com/sys-bio/vscode-antimony.",AB_0593
"importance pregnancy induces unique physiologic changes to the immune response and hormonal changes leading to plausible differences in the risk of developing post-acute sequelae of sars-cov-2 (pasc), or long covid. exposure to sars-cov-2 during pregnancy may also have long-term ramifications for exposed offspring, and it is critical to evaluate the health outcomes of exposed children. the national institutes of health (nih) researching covid to enhance recovery (recover) multi-site observational study of pasc aims to evaluate the long-term sequelae of sars-cov-2 infection in various populations. recover-pregnancy was designed specifically to address long-term outcomes in maternal-child dyads.methods recover-pregnancy cohort is a combined prospective and retrospective cohort that proposes to enroll 2,300 individuals with a pregnancy during the covid-19 pandemic and their offspring exposed and unexposed in utero, including single and multiple gestations. enrollment will occur both in person at 27 sites through the eunice kennedy shriver national institutes of health maternal-fetal medicine units network and remotely through national recruitment by the study team at the university of california san francisco (ucsf). adults with and without sars-cov-2 infection during pregnancy are eligible for enrollment in the pregnancy cohort and will follow the protocol for recover-adult including validated screening tools, laboratory analyses and symptom questionnaires followed by more in-depth phenotyping of pasc on a subset of the overall cohort. offspring exposed and unexposed in utero to sars-cov-2 maternal infection will undergo screening tests for neurodevelopment and other health outcomes at 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 months of age. blood specimens will be collected at 24 months of age for sars-cov-2 antibody testing, storage and anticipated later analyses proposed by recover and other investigators.discussion recover-pregnancy will address whether having sars-cov-2 during pregnancy modifies the risk factors, prevalence, and phenotype of pasc. the pregnancy cohort will also establish whether there are increased risks of adverse long-term outcomes among children exposed in utero.clinical trials.gov identifier clinical trial registration: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. unique identifier: nct05172011.",AB_0593
