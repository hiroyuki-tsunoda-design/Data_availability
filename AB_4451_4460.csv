"the patent literature is a potentially valuable source of bioactivity data. in this article we describe a process to prioritise 3.7 million life science relevant patents obtained from the surechembl database (https://www.surechembl.org/), according to how likely they were to contain bioactivity data for potent small molecules on less-studied targets, based on the classification developed by the illuminating the druggable genome (idg) project. the overall goal was to select a smaller number of patents that could be manually curated and incorporated into the chembl database. using relatively simple annotation and filtering pipelines, we have been able to identify a substantial number of patents containing quantitative bioactivity data for understudied targets that had not previously been reported in the peer-reviewed medicinal chemistry literature. we quantify the added value of such methods in terms of the numbers of targets that are so identified, and provide some specific illustrative examples. our work underlines the potential value in searching the patent corpus in addition to the more traditional peer-reviewed literature. the small molecules found in these patents, together with their measured activity against the targets, are now accessible via the chembl database.",AB_0446
"the unet model consists of fully convolutional network (fcn) layers arranged as contracting encoder and upsampling decoder maps. nested arrangements of these encoder and decoder maps give rise to extensions of the unet model, such as unete and unet++. other refinements include constraining the outputs of the convolutional layers to discriminate between segment labels when trained end to end, a property called deep supervision. this reduces feature diversity in these nested unet models despite their large parameter space. furthermore, for texture segmentation, pixel correlations at multiple scales contribute to the classification task; hence, explicit deep supervision of shallower layers is likely to enhance performance. in this paper, we propose ads_unet, a stage-wise additive training algorithm that incorporates resource-efficient deep supervision in shallower layers and takes performance-weighted combinations of the sub-unets to create the segmentation model. we provide empirical evidence on three histopathology datasets to support the claim that the proposed ads_unet reduces correlations between constituent features and improves performance while being more resource efficient. we demonstrate that ads_unet outperforms state-of-the-art transformer -based models by 1.08 and 0.6 points on crag and bcss datasets, and yet requires only 37% of gpu consumption and 34% of training time as that required by transformers. the source code is available at: https://github.com/ynulonger/ads_unet.",AB_0446
"the intfold server based at the university of reading has been a leading method over the past decade in providing free access to accurate prediction of protein structures and functions. in a post-alphafold2 world, accurate models of tertiary structures are widely available for even more protein targets, so there has been a refocus in the prediction community towards the accurate modelling of protein-ligand interactions as well as modelling quaternary structure assemblies. in this paper, we describe the latest improvements to intfold, which maintains its competitive structure prediction performance by including the latest deep learning methods while also integrating accurate model quality estimates and 3d models of protein-ligand interactions. further-more, we also introduce our two new server methods: multifold for accurately modelling both tertiary and quaternary structures, with performance which has been independently verified to outperform the standard alphafold2 methods, and modfolddock, which provides world-leading quality estimates for quaternary structure models. the intfold7, multi-fold and modfolddock servers are available at: https://www.reading.ac.uk/bioinf/.",AB_0446
"background the first onset of common mental health disorders, such as mood and anxiety disorders, mostly lies in adolescence or young adulthood. hence, effective and scalable prevention programs for this age group are urgently needed. interventions focusing on repetitive negative thinking (rnt) appear especially promising as rnt is an important transdiagnostic process involved in the development of depression and anxiety disorders. first clinical trials indeed show positive effects of preventative interventions targeting rnt on adult as well as adolescent mental health. self-help interventions that can be delivered via a mobile phone app may have the advantage of being highly scalable, thus facilitating prevention on a large scale. this trial aims to investigate whether an app-based rnt-focused intervention can reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms in young people at risk for mental health disorders. methods the trial will be conducted in a sample (planned n = 351) of individuals aged 16-22 years with elevated levels of rnt but no current depression or anxiety disorder. in a randomized controlled between-subjects design, two versions of the app-based self-help intervention will be compared to a waiting list control condition. the full rntfocused intervention encompasses a variety of rnt-reducing strategies, whereas the concreteness training intervention focuses on only one of these strategies, i.e., concrete thinking. the primary outcome (depressive symptoms) and secondary outcomes (anxiety symptoms and rnt) will be measured at pre-intervention, post-intervention (6 weeks after pre-intervention), and follow-up (18 weeks after pre-intervention). discussion this trial aims to find out whether targeting rnt via an app is an effective and feasible way of preventing depression and anxiety disorders in adolescents. since app-based interventions are highly scalable, this trial might contribute to tackling challenges related to the increasing rates of mental health disorders among young people. trial registration https://www.drks.de, drks00027384. registered on 21 february 2022-prospectively registered.",AB_0446
"objective: most young autistic children display emotional and behavioral problems (ebps). there is evidence that behavioral parenting interventions (bpis) reduce these. the covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns can be seen as a natural experiment to test the longer-term effect of bpis under conditions of increased uncertainty. method: opportunistic follow-up (n = 49) of a pilot randomized controlled trial (rct) cohort (n = 62 autistic children aged 6-11 years; originally randomized to a 12-week group bpi [predictive parenting; n = 31] or an attention control [psychoeducation; n = 31]) was conducted during covid-19-related lockdowns. measures of parent-reported child irritability and parenting stress were collected at 3 time points (baseline: mean age = 6.7 years; primary endpoint: mean age = 7.1 years, similar to 5 months after randomization; and covid-19 follow-up: mean age = 8.8 years, similar to 2 years after randomization). we tested the magnitude of intervention effects using point estimates of differences in child irritability and parenting stress between arms at primary endpoint and covid-19 follow-up, covarying for baseline scores. we used area under the curve (auc) analyses to obtain overall estimates of the average intervention effect across all 3 timepoints. semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with a subsample of parents (n = 18). results: a small but significant intervention effect was found from baseline to covid-19 follow-up in favor of predictive parenting on parent -reported child irritability (d = -0.33, 95% ci = -0.65, -0.01) and parenting stress (d = -0.31, 95% ci = -0.59, -0.03). no overall mean intervention effect for these measures as estimated by the auc analyses (which takes into account the nonsignificant effect at primary endpoint) was found. interview feedback on the both interventions was positive, and parents reported using strategies from predictive parenting during covid-19-related restrictions. conclusion: this opportunistic follow-up study at a time of stress indicates the need for careful consideration of how and when to measure the effects of bpis in autistic child populations. future trials should consider both the most appropriate endpoint and in what context effects may be more likely to be seen.clinical trial registration information: autism spectrum treatment and resilience (astar); https://www.isrctn.com; 91411078.",AB_0446
"high-throughput screening (hts), as one of the key techniques in drug discovery, is frequently used to identify promising drug candidates in a largely automated and cost-effective way. one of the necessary conditions for successful hts campaigns is a large and diverse compound library, enabling hundreds of thousands of activity measurements per project. such collections of data hold great promise for computational and experimental drug discovery efforts, especially when leveraged in combination with modern deep learning techniques, and can potentially lead to improved drug activity predictions and cheaper and more effective experimental design. however, existing collections of machine-learning-ready public datasets do not exploit the multiple data modalities present in real-world hts projects. thus, the largest fraction of experimental measurements, corresponding to hundreds of thousands of noisy activity values from primary screening, are effectively ignored in the majority of machine learning models of hts data. to address these limitations, we introduce multifidelity pubchem bioassay (mf-pcba), a curated collection of 60 datasets that includes two data modalities for each dataset, corresponding to primary and confirmatory screening, an aspect that we call multifidelity. multifidelity data accurately reflect real-world hts conventions and present a new, challenging task for machine learning: the integration of low- and high-fidelity measurements through molecular representation learning, taking into account the orders-of-magnitude difference in size between the primary and confirmatory screens. here we detail the steps taken to assemble mf-pcba in terms of data acquisition from pubchem and the filtering steps required to curate the raw data. we also provide an evaluation of a recent deep-learning-based method for multifidelity integration across the introduced datasets, demonstrating the benefit of leveraging all hts modalities, and a discussion in terms of the roughness of the molecular activity landscape. in total, mf-pcba contains over 16.6 million unique molecule-protein interactions. the datasets can be easily assembled by using the source code available at https://github.com/davidbuterez/ mf-pcba.",AB_0446

"hadronic light-by-light scattering is one of the virtual processes that causes the gyromagnetic factor g of the muon to deviate from the value of two predicted by dirac's theory. this process makes one of the largest contributions to the uncertainty of the standard model prediction for the muon (g - 2). lattice qcd allows for a first-principles approach to computing this non-perturbative effect. in order to avoid power-law finite-size artifacts generated by virtual photons in lattice simulations, we follow a coordinate-space approach involving a weighted integral over the vertices of the qcd four-point function of the electromagnetic current carried by the quarks. here we present in detail the semi-analytical calculation of the qed part of the amplitude, employing position-space perturbation theory in continuous, infinite four-dimensional euclidean space. we also provide some useful information about a computer code for the numerical implementation of our approach that has been made public at https://github.com/rjhudspith/kqed.",AB_0446
"most cell type-specific genes are regulated by the interaction of enhancers with their promoters. the identification of enhancers is not trivial as enhancers are diverse in their characteristics and dynamic in their interaction partners. we present esearch3d, a newmethod that exploits network theory approaches to identify active enhancers. our work is based on the fact that enhancers act as a source of regulatory information to increase the rate of transcription of their target genes and that the flow of this information is mediated by the folding of chromatin in the three-dimensional (3d) nuclear space between the enhancer and the target gene promoter. esearch3d reverse engineers this flow of information to calculate the likelihood of enhancer activity in intergenic regions by propagating the transcription levels of genes across 3d genome networks. regions predicted to have high enhancer activity are shown to be enriched in annotations indicative of enhancer activity. these include: enhancer-associated histone marks, bidirectional cage-seq, starr-seq, p300, rna polymerase ii and expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls). esearch3d leverages the relationship between chromatin architecture and transcription, allowing the prediction of active enhancers and an understanding of the complex underpinnings of regulatory networks. the method is available at: https://github.com/infomics/esearch3d and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7737123.",AB_0446
"introductionin the uk, the national cancer plan (2000) requires every cancer patient's care to be reviewed by a multidisciplinary team (mdt). since the introduction of these guidelines, mdts have faced escalating demands with increasing numbers and complexity of cases. the covid-19 pandemic has presented mdts with the challenge of running mdt meetings virtually rather than face-to-face. this study aims to explore how the change from face-to-face to virtual mdt meetings during the covid-19 pandemic may have impacted the effectiveness of decision-making in cancer mdt meetings and to make recommendations to improve future cancer mdt working based on the findings. methods and analysis a mixed-methods study with three parallel phases: 1. semistructured remote qualitative interviews with <= 40 cancer mdt members. 2. a national cross-sectional online survey of cancer mdt members in england, using a validated questionnaire with both multiple-choice and free-text questions. 3. live observations of >= 6 virtual/hybrid cancer mdt meetings at four nhs trusts. participants will be recruited from cancer alliances in england. data collection tools have been developed in consultation with stakeholders, based on a conceptual framework devised from decision-making models and mdt guidelines. quantitative data will be summarised descriptively, and chi(2) tests run to explore associations. qualitative data will be analysed using applied thematic analysis. using a convergent design, mixed-methods data will be triangulated guided by the conceptual framework.the study has been approved by nhs research ethics committee (london-hampstead) (22/hra/0177). the results will be shared through peer-reviewed journals and academic conferences. a report summarising key findings will be used to develop a resource pack for mdts to translate learnings from this study into improved effectiveness of virtual mdt meetings. the study has been registered on the open science framework (https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/d2nhw).",AB_0446
