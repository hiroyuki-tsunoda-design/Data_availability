"backgroundmultidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial (mrgnb) infections represent a major public health threat. cancer patients and, among them, hematological patients are most vulnerable to these infections. gut colonization by mrgnb is a common phenomenon occurring during hospitalization and chemotherapy exposure. in the neutropenic phase that occurs after chemotherapy, mrgnb translocation occurs increasing patient's mortality. fluoroquinolone prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin efficacy is now being questioned due to the increase of incidence in mrgnb.methodsa phase iii randomized, controlled, clinical trial, open-label parallel-group with a 1:1 ratio, aimed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of oral fosfomycin versus oral ciprofloxacin for febrile neutropenia prevention in patients with acute leukemia (al) or hematopoietic cell transplant (hsc) receptors. weekly surveillance cultures are planned to detect gut colonization. changes in fecal microbiome at the beginning and end of prophylaxis will also be analyzed.discussionthis trial will provide evidence of the efficacy of an alternative drug to ciprofloxacin for febrile neutropenia prevention in high-risk hematological patients. the battery of planned microbiological studies will allow us to evaluate prospectively the microbiological safety of both pharmacological strategies in terms of the selection of mrgnb occurring in each arm. in addition, valuable information on the way in which each drug changes the fecal microbiome of the patients throughout the treatment will be generated.trial registrationclinical trials nct05311254, registered on 5 april 2022, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct05311254?term=fovocip&cntry=es&draw=2&rank=1. protocol version: 3.0, dated 20 may 2022.",AB_0480
"motivation: coincidence of convergent amino acid substitutions (caas) with phenotypic convergences allow pinpointing genes and even individual mutations that are likely to be associated with trait variation within their phylogenetic context. such findings can provide useful insights into the genetic architecture of complex phenotypes. results: here we introduce caastools, a set of bioinformatics tools to identify and validate caas in orthologous protein alignments for predefined groups of species representing the phenotypic values targeted by the user. availability and implementation: caastools source code is available at http://github.com/linudz/caastools, along with documentation and examples.",AB_0480
"impaired cardiovascular autonomic control following space flight or immobilization may limit the ability to cope with additional hemodynamic stimuli. head-down tilt bedrest is an established terrestrial analog for space flight and offers the opportunity to test potential countermeasures for autonomic cardiovascular deconditioning. previous studies revealed a possible benefit of daily artificial gravity on cardiovascular autonomic control following head-down tilt bedrest, but there is a need for efficiency in a long-term study before an artificial gravity facility would be brought to space. we hypothesized that artificial gravity through short-arm centrifugation attenuates functional adaptions of autonomic function during head-down tilt bed rest. 24 healthy persons (8 women, 33.4 +/- 9.3 years, 24.3 +/- 2.1 kg/m(2)) participated in the 60-day head-down tilt bed rest (agbresa) study. they were assigned to three groups, 30 min/day continuous, or 6(5 min intermittent short-arm centrifugation, or a control group. we assessed autonomic cardiovascular control in the supine position and in 5 minutes 80 degrees head-up tilt position before and immediately after bed rest. we computed heart rate variability (hrv) in the time (rmssd) and frequency domain, blood pressure variability, and baroreflex sensitivity (brs). rr interval corrected rmssd was reduced supine (p = 0.0358) and during hut (p = 0.0161). heart rate variability in the high-frequency band (hf-rri; p = 0.0004) and brs (p < 0.0001) decreased, whereas blood pressure variability in the low-frequency band (lf-sbp, p = 0.0008) increased following bedrest in all groups. we did not detect significant interactions between bedrest and interventions. we conclude that up to daily 30 min of artificial gravity on a short-arm centrifuge with 1gz at the center of mass do not suffice to prevent changes in autonomic cardiovascular control following 60-day of 6 degrees head-down tilt bed rest. clinical trial registration: https://drks.de/search/en/trial/drks00015677, identifier, drks00015677.",AB_0480
"biological databases are essential resources for life science research, but finding and selecting the most relevant and up-to-date databases can be challenging due to the large number and diversity of available databases. the nucleic acids research (nar) journal publishes annual database issues that provide a comprehensive list of databases in the molecular biology domain. however, the information provided by nar is limited and sometimes does not reflect the current status and quality of the databases. in this article, we present a web-based platform for the annotation and analysis of nar-published databases. the platform allows users to manually curate and enrich the nar entries with additional information such as availability, downloadability, source code links, cross-references, and duplicates. statistics and visualizations on various aspects of the database landscape, such as recency, status, category, and curation history are also provided. currently, it contains a total of 2,246 database entries of which 2,025 are unique with the majority updated within the last five years. around 75% of all databases are still available and more than half provide a download option. cross references to database commons are available for 1,889 entries. the platform is freely available online at https://nardbstatus.kalis-amts.de and aims to help researchers in database selection and decision-making. it also provides insights into the current state and challenges of a subset of all databases in the life sciences.",AB_0480
"the european union data collection framework (dcf) states that scientific data-driven assessments are essential to achieve sustainable fisheries. to respond to the dcf call, this study introduces the information systems developed and used by institut catala de recerca per a la governanca del mar (icatmar), the catalan institute of research for the governance of the seas. the information systems include data from a biological monitoring, curation, processing, analysis, publication and web visualization for bottom trawl fisheries. over the 4 years of collected data (2019-2022), the sampling program developed a dataset of over 1.1 million sampled individuals accounting for 24.6 tons of catch. the sampling data are ingested into a database through a data input website ensuring data management control and quality. the standardized metrics are automatically calculated and the data are published in the web visualizer, combined with fishing landings and vessel monitoring system (vms) records. as the combination of remote sensing data with fisheries monitoring offers new approaches for ecosystem assessment, the collected fisheries data are also visualized in combination with georeferenced seabed habitats from the european marine observation and data network (emodnet), climate and sea conditions from copernicus monitoring environment marine service (cmems) on the web browser. three public web-based products have been developed in the visualizer: geolocated bottom trawl samplings, biomass distribution per port or season and length-frequency charts per species. these information systems aim to fulfil the gaps in the scientific community, administration and civil society to access high-quality data for fisheries management, following the findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (fair) principles, enabling scientific knowledge transfer.database url https://icatmar.github.io/visap/(www.icatmar.cat)",AB_0480
"we rethink the traditional reinforcement learning approach, which is based on optimizing over feedback policies, and propose a new framework that optimizes over feedforward inputs instead. this not only mitigates the risk of destabilizing the system during training but also reduces the bulk of the learning to a supervised learning task. as a result, efficient and well-understood supervised learning techniques can be applied and are tuned using a validation data set. the labels are generated with a variant of iterative learning control, which also includes prior knowledge about the underlying dynamics. our framework is applied for intercepting and returning ping-pong balls that are played to a four-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm in real-world experiments. the robot arm is driven by pneumatic artificial muscles, which makes the control and learning tasks challenging. we highlight the potential of our framework by comparing it to a reinforcement learning approach that optimizes over feedback policies. we find that our framework achieves a higher success rate for the returns (100% vs. 96%, on 107 consecutive trials, see https://youtu.be/kr9joweh7py) while requiring only about one tenth of the samples during training. we also find that our approach is able to deal with a variant of different incoming trajectories.",AB_0480
"we present a statistical model, gernermed++, for german medical natural language processing trained for named entity recognition (ner) as an open, publicly available model. we demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multiple techniques in order to achieve strong results in entity recognition performance by the means of transfer-learning on pre-trained deep language models (lm), word-alignment and neural machine translation, outperforming a pre-existing baseline model on several datasets. due to the sparse situation of open, public medical entity recognition models for german texts, this work offers benefits to the german research community on medical nlp as a baseline model. the work serves as a refined successor to our first gernermed model. similar to our previous work, our trained model is publicly available to other researchers. the sample code and the statistical model is available at: https://github.com/frankkramer-lab/gernermed-pp.",AB_0480
"high-throughput sequencing methods have increased the accessibility of plastid genomes, which are crucial for clarifying phylogenetic relationships. current large sequencing efforts require software tools for routine display of their distinctive quadripartite structure, which is denoted by four junction sites. by concentrating on these junctions and their close vicinity, irscope has emerged as the standard tool for detection of this structure and creating simplified comparative graphical maps of plastid genomes. here, we provide an augmented version (irplus) that encompasses a novel set of functions such as integrated error detection, flexible color schemes, and an upgraded method to detect inverted repeats in genomic sequences. spanning across the plant tree of life, irplus allows the quick visualization of various sets of plastid genomes and features, next to smooth interoperability with other widely used annotation file formats and platforms. the irplus can be accessed at https://irscope.shinyapps.io/irplus/, and source codes are freely available at https://github.com/amiryousefilab/irplus.",AB_0480
"in recent years, cheminformatics has experienced significant advancements through the development of new open-source software tools based on various cheminformatics programming toolkits. however, adopting these toolkits presents challenges, including proper installation, setup, deployment, and compatibility management. in this work, we present the cheminformatics microservice. this open-source solution provides a unified interface for accessing commonly used functionalities of multiple cheminformatics toolkits, namely rdkit, chemistry development kit (cdk), and open babel. in addition, more advanced functionalities like structure generation and optical chemical structure recognition (ocsr) are made available through the cheminformatics microservice based on pre-existing tools. the software service also enables developers to extend the functionalities easily and to seamlessly integrate them with existing workflows and applications. it is built on fastapi and containerized using docker, making it highly scalable. an instance of the microservice is publicly available at https://api.naturalproducts.net. the source code is publicly accessible on github, accompanied by comprehensive documentation, version control, and continuous integration and deployment workflows. all resources can be found at the following link: https://github.com/steinbeck-lab/cheminformatics-microservice.",AB_0480
