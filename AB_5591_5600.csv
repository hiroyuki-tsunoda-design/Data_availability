"integrative analysis of multi-omic datasets has proven to be extremely valuable in cancer research and precision medicine. however, obtaining multi-modal data from the same samples is often difficult. integrating multiple datasets of different omics remains a challenge, with only a few available algorithms developed to solve it. here, we present intend (integration of transcriptomic and epige-nomic data), a novel algorithm for integrating gene expression and dna methylation datasets covering disjoint sets of samples. to enable integration, intend learns a predictive model between the two omics by training on multi-omic data measured on the same set of samples. in comprehensive testing on 11 tcga (the cancer genome atlas) cancer datasets spanning 4329 patients, intend achieves significantly superior results compared with four state-of-the-art integration algorithms. we also demonstrate intend's ability to uncover connections between dna methylation and the regulation of gene expression in the joint analysis of two lung adenocarcinoma single-omic datasets from different sources. intend's data-driven approach makes it a valuable multi-omic data integration tool. the code for intend is available at https://github.com/shamir-lab/intend",AB_0560
"background: : almonds are nutrient rich, providing a healthier alternative to many snacks. studies report health benefits with regular almond con-sumption without adverse weight gain. however, most interventions have been relatively short or have included additional dietary advice.objectives: taking a pragmatic approach, we compared consumption of almonds compared with biscuits on body weight and other health outcomes in a population of regular snackers of discretionary foods, hypothesizing the almonds will displace some of the less-healthful snacks in their current diets.methods: we randomly assigned 136 nonobese habitual discretionary snackers to receive almonds or biscuits daily for 1 y. these isocaloric snacks provided either 10% of participants' total energy (te) requirements or 1030 kj (equivalent to 42.5 g almonds), whichever was greater. anthropometry, blood biomarkers, diet, appetite, sleep, and physical activity were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 mo, and body composition and rmr at baseline and 12 mo.results: the difference in changes for body weight from baseline to 12 mo was not statistically significant (geometric means: 67.1 and 69.5 kg for almonds and 66.3 and 66.3 kg for biscuits, p = 0.275). there were no statistically significant differences in changes for body composition or other nondietary outcomes (all p & ge; 0.112). absolute intakes of protein; total, polyunsaturated, and monosaturated fat; fiber; vitamin e; calcium; copper; magnesium; phosphorous; and zinc, and % te from total monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fat statistically significantly increased from baseline (all p < 0.033), whereas % te from carbohydrate and sugar statistically significantly (both p < 0.014) decreased from baseline, in the almond compared with the biscuit group.conclusions: almonds can be incorporated into the diets of habitual snackers to improve diet quality, without evidence for changes in body weight, compared with a popular discretionary snack food. this trial was registered at the australian new zealand clinical trials registry (https://www.an zctr.org.au/trial/registration/trialreview.aspx?id=375610 & isreview=true), registration number actrn12618001758291.",AB_0560
"background: total mesorectal excision is the standard surgical procedure for rectal cancer treatment. several studies have shown a close correlation between the prognosis of patients with rectal cancer and the completeness of the mesorectal specimen. objective: to assess the correlation between macroscopic assessment of mesorectal excision and long-term oncological outcomes. design: retrospective analysis of an institutional review board-approved database. settings: tertiary referral center. patients: patients with rectal cancer who were operated on between march 2016 and october 2019 were classified into 3 groups based on the mesorectal specimen quality: complete, near complete, and incomplete. only patients with a follow-up of <= 2 years and without signs of preoperative distant disease were included. main outcome measures: relationship between total mesorectal excision and local and distant recurrence rates in patients with rectal cancer. results: a total of 124 patients (35.5% females) were included in the analysis, with a mean age of 58.1 (sd 12) years and a mean bmi of 26.4 (sd 4.59) kg/m(2). neoadjuvant chemoradiation was administered to 71% of patients, whereas 13.7% received total neoadjuvant therapy. restorative procedures were performed in 107 patients (86.3%), whereas 17 patients (13.7%) underwent abdominoperineal resection. the majority of mesorectal excision specimens (87.09%) were complete or near complete. local recurrence rates were 6.3% (1/16) in the incomplete and 7.4% (8/108) in the complete/near complete group (p = 0.86). metachronous distant metastases occurred in 6 patients (37.5%) in the incomplete group and in 24 patients (22.2%) in the complete/near complete group (p = 0.18). thus, specimen quality did not appear to impact disease-free survival. limitations: retrospective, single-center study with relatively short follow-up. conclusions: in the era of a multidisciplinary approach and extensive use of neoadjuvant therapy, macroscopic completeness of total mesorectal excision may not be as valuable a prognosticator as in the past. larger studies with longer follow-ups are needed to clarify these preliminary findings. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c129",AB_0560
"multiple sequence alignments (msas) are the workhorse of molecular evolution and structural biology research. from msas, the amino acids that are tolerated at each site during protein evolution can be inferred. however, little is known regarding the repertoire of tolerated amino acids in proteins when only a few or no sequence homologs are available, such as orphan and de novo designed proteins. here we present evorator2, a deep-learning algorithm trained on over 15,000 protein structures that can predict which amino acids are tolerated at any given site, based exclusively on protein structural information mined from atomic coordinate files. we show that evorator2 obtained satisfying results for the prediction of position-weighted scoring matrices (pssm). we further show that evorator2 obtained near state-of-the-art performance on proteins with high quality structures in predicting the effect of mutations in deep mutation scanning (dms) experiments and that for certain dms targets, evorator2 outperformed state-of-the-art methods. we also show that by combining evorator20s predictions with those obtained by a state-of-the-art deep-learning method that accounts for the information in the msa, the prediction of the effect of mutation in dms experiments was improved in terms of both accuracy and stability. evorator2 is designed to predict which amino-acid substitutions are tolerated in such proteins without many homologous sequences, including orphan or de novo designed proteins. we implemented our approach in the evorator web server (https://evorator.tau.ac.il).(c) 2023 published by elsevier ltd.",AB_0560
"ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) captures a snapshot of ribosomes' locations at the entire transcriptome of a cell at sub-codon resolution providing insights into gene expression and enabling the discovery of novel translated regions. ribogalaxy (https://ribogalaxy.genomicsdatascience.ie/), a galaxy-based platform for processing ribo-seq data is a riboseq.org (https://riboseq.org/) resource. riboseq.org is an online gateway to a set of integrated tools for the processing and analysis of ribo-seq data. in this ribogalaxy update we introduce changes to both the tools available on ribogalaxy and to how the resource is man-aged on the backend. for example, in order to improve interoperability between riboseq.org resources, we added tools that link ribogalaxy outputs with trips-viz and gwips-viz browsers for downstream anal-ysis and visualisation. ribogalaxy's backend now utilises ansible configuration management which enhances its stability and jobs are executed within singularity containers and are managed by slurm, strengthening reproducibility and performance respectively. & copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0560
"mp-citdse is a package of programs which solves the time-dependent schrodinger equation for hydrogenic and helium-like atomic systems interacting with an ultra-short laser pulse (of attosecond or femtosecond duration). the output of the computations - with some minimal processing - may be used to calculate excited populations, single and double ionisation yields, kinetic, angular and radial electron distributions, and harmonic yields. for the helium atom, a full account of the inter-electronic correlation effects is included via a configuration interaction approach; for the time propagation of the wavefunction a spectral basis expansion on the eigenstates of the field-free hamiltonian is used; for this reason post -processing of the expansion coefficients just after the pulse lead to simple formulas for quantities of experimental interest. program summary program title: mp-citdse cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /gv4zxmfdx3 .1 developer's repository link: https://github .com /aforembs /mp-citdse licensing provisions: gplv3 programming language: c++ nature of problem: the ultra-fast high-intensity laser pulses of modern experimental sources require an ab-initio theoretical treatment, as the characteristics of such pulses are generally incompatible with the established lowest-order perturbation theory (lopt) approximation. such a treatment can be quite cumbersome to not only implement, but also describe in a clear, intuitive manner. its inherent complexity ensures that even in its simplest form, an ab-initio tdse solver can easily consist of several thousand lines of code. as with any project of such scope a significant amount of effort is required to keep the code up to date, running on several platforms, compilers and operating systems. as such, while the numerical problem tackled by mp-citdse is that of the simulation of hydrogenic and helium-like atom-laser interactions on a single node computer/workstation; its main challenges are longevity and expandability. by doing away with unnecessary abstractions within the code, using a modern standard of a widely used and performant language (c++ 17) and hosting the source code on a publicly available github repository we hope that the programs provided herein prove themselves useful to many current and future amo physicists. solution method: the atomic systems are considered confined in a spherical box of finite size. in the one-electron case (hydrogen) the eigenstates are calculated in a spherical coordinate system by the direct diagonalisation of the field-free hamiltonian matrix representation on a b-splines piecewise polynomial basis expansion of the radial part of the eigenfunctions; for the two-electron case (helium) the numerically calculated one-electron eigenstates are angularly coupled to form a zero-order (uncorrelated) two-electron numerical basis; then the latter basis is further coupled via a configuration-interaction approach to eventually calculate the helium's two-electron eigenstates. following these steps, for both systems (hydrogen and helium) the computation proceeds by expanding the time-dependent wavefunction on the corresponding field-free eigenstate basis; thus, we end up to a system of first-order ordinary differential equations (odes) in time for the expansion (time-dependent) coefficients; the dynamical parameters for the odes time propagation, namely the eigenenergies and dipole matrix elements are calculated only once prior to the odes propagation [2]. the structure of the propagating matrix is block tridiagonal. additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: this paper serves as the definitive reference for the mp-citdse code. in this version we solve the odes using a runge-kutta-felnberg (rkf) algorithm. also we have restricted the code to treat hydrogen and helium but with very little effort (non-relativistic) hydrogenic and helium-like atomic systems can also be simulated. the programs are supplied with two methods of compilation, via make and cmake to ensure greater portability.",AB_0560
"motivation: imaging spatial transcriptomics techniques characterize gene expression in cells in their native context by imaging barcoded probes for mrna with single molecule resolution. however, the need to acquire many rounds of high-magnification imaging data limits the throughput and impact of existing methods. results: we describe the joint sparse method for imaging transcriptomics, an algorithm for decoding lower magnification imaging spatial transcriptomics data than that used in standard experimental workflows. joint sparse method for imaging transcriptomics incorporates code-book knowledge and sparsity assumptions into an optimization problem, which is less reliant on well separated optical signals than current pipelines. using experimental data obtained by performing multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization on tissue from mouse brain, we demonstrate that joint sparse method for imaging transcriptomics enables improved throughput and recovery performance over standard decoding methods. availability and implementation: software implementation of jsit, together with example files, is available at https://github.com/jpbryan13/jsit.",AB_0560

"introductioncalcification of soft tissues is a common age-related pathology that primarily occurs within vascular tissue. the mechanisms underlying pathological calcification in humans and tissue specificity of the process is still poorly understood. previous studies examined calcified tissues on one to one basis, thus preventing comparison of deregulated pathways across tissues. purposethis study aimed to establish common and tissue-specific changes associated with calcification in aorta, artery tibial, coronary artery and pituitary gland in subjects from the genotype-tissue expression (gtex) dataset using its rna sequencing and histological data. methodswe used publicly available data from the gtex database https://gtexportal.org/home/aboutgtex. all gtex tissue samples were derived by the gtex consorcium from deceased donors, with age from 20 to 79, both men and women. gtex study authorization was obtained via next-of-kin consent for the collection and banking of de-identified tissue samples for scientific research. hematoxylin and eosin (h & e) staining of arteries were manually graded based on the presence of calcification on a scale from zero to four, where zero designates absence of calcification and four designates severe calcification. samples with fat contamination and mislabeled tissues were excluded, which left 430 aorta, 595 artery tibial, 124 coronary artery, and 283 pituitary samples for downstream gene expression analysis. transcript levels of protein-coding genes were associated with calcification grade using sex, age bracket and cause of death as covariates, and tested for pathway enrichment using gene set enrichment analysis. resultswe identified calcification deposits in 28 (6.5%) aortas, 121 (20%), artery tibials, 54 (43%), coronary arteries, and 24 (8%) pituitary glands of gtex subjects. we observed an age-dependent increase in incidence of calcification in all vascular tissues, but not in pituitary. subjects with calcification in the artery tibial were significantly more likely to have calcification in the coronary artery (or = 2.56, p = 6.3e-07). markers of calcification previously established in preclinical and in vitro studies, e.g., bmp2 and runx2, were deregulated in the calcified tibial and coronary arteries, confirming the relevance of these genes to human pathology. differentially expressed genes associated with calcification poorly overlapped across tissues suggesting tissue-specific nuances in mechanisms of calcification. nevertheless, calcified arteries unanimously down-regulated pathways of intracellular transport and up-regulated inflammatory pathways suggesting these as universal targets for pathological calcification. in particular, pd-1 and pd-l1 genes were up-regulated in calcified tissues but not in the blood of the same subjects, suggesting that localized inflammation contributes to pathological calcification. conclusionpathological calcification is a prevalent disease of aging that shares little changes in expression in individual genes across tissues. however, our analysis suggests that it potentially can be targeted by alleviating local inflammation of soft tissues.",AB_0560
"high oxalate level in blood and urine may cause oxalate-related disorders, particularly kidney stone disease. to unravel disease mechanisms, investigations of oxalate level and its binding proteins are required. however, the information on oxalate-binding proteins is limited due to a lack of appropriate tool for their investigations. therefore, we have developed a freely accessible web-based tool, namely oxabind (https://www.stonemod. org/oxabind.php), to identify oxalate-binding site(s) in any proteins of interest. the prediction model was generated by recruiting all of the known oxalate-binding proteins with solid experimental evidence (from pubmed and rcsb protein data bank). the potential oxalate-binding domains/motifs were predicted from these oxalate-binding proteins using pratt tool and used to discriminate these known oxalate-binding proteins from the known non-oxalate-binding proteins. the best one, which provided highest fitness score, sensitivity and specificity, was then implemented to create the oxabind tool. after inputting protein identifier or sequence (which can be single or multiple), details of all the identified oxalate-binding site(s), if any, are presented in both textual and graphical formats. oxabind also provides theoretical three-dimensional (3d) structure of the protein with oxalate-binding site(s) being highlighted. this tool will be beneficial for future research on the oxalate -binding proteins, which play important roles in the oxalate-related disorders.",AB_0560
