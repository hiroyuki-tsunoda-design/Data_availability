"the discovery and utilization of natural products derived from endophytic microorganisms have garnered significant attention in pharmaceutical research. while remarkable progress has been made in this field each year, the absence of dedicated open-access databases for endophytic microorganism natural products research is evident. to address the increasing demand for mining and sharing of data resources related to endophytic microorganism natural products, this study introduces emnpd, a comprehensive endophytic microorganism natural products database comprising manually curated data. currently, emnpd offers 6632 natural products from 1017 endophytic microorganisms, targeting 1286 entities (including 94 proteins, 282 cell lines, and 910 species) with 91 diverse bioactivities. it encompasses the physico-chemical properties of natural products, admet information, quantitative activity data with their potency, natural products contents with diverse fermentation conditions, systematic taxonomy, and links to various well-established databases. emnpd aims to function as an open-access knowledge repository for the study of endophytic microorganisms and their natural products, thereby facilitating drug discovery research and exploration of bioactive substances. the database can be accessed at http://emnpd.idrblab.cn/ without the need for registration, enabling researchers to freely download the data. emnpd is expected to become a valuable resource in the field of endophytic microorganism natural products and contribute to future drug development endeavors.",AB_0215
"support from family and peers may enhance the outcomes of diabetes management. this study reported the preliminary effect of a family-based diabetes self-management education and support (dsmes) programme on the perceived support status of people with diabetes and the family's caregiver support behaviour amongst dyads living in western ethiopia. a 1:1 two-armed pilot randomised controlled trial (rct) was conducted. a total of 76 dyads were recruited using the convenience sampling method and randomly assigned to either intervention or control groups. the control group continued the usual care, whereas the intervention group continued the usual care and additionally received a 12-h social cognitive theory (sct)-guided, family-supported dsmes programme in the community. generalised estimating equations models were computed to test the preliminary effects of the dsmes programme on the outcomes. p-value<0.05 was set as statistically significant. the pilot rct shows a statistically significant between-group difference in the changes in support needed at t1 (d=0.88) and t2 (d=1.35) and support received at t1 (d=0.88) and t2 (d=1.44). the dsmes programme has outperformed usual care with a medium effect size at t1 (d=0.54) and a large effect size at t2 (d=0.97) on the family's supportive behaviour. although the intervention group was not statistically significant at t1 (d=0.43), a large effect size was obtained at t2 (d=0.97) on the family's non-supportive behaviour. a sct-guided, family-supported dsmes programme produced a promising positive effect on enhancing the support needed and support received from their family/friends, and it also improved the family's supportive behaviour. thus, family support could be incorporated into dsmes programmes for diabetes management in western ethiopia. the trial was registered by the chinese clinical trial registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn); registration number: chictr2000040292.",AB_0215
"programmed cell death (pcd) refers to controlled cell death that is conducted to keep the internal environment stable. long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) participate in the progression of pcd in a variety of diseases. however, no specialized online repository is available to collect and store the associations between lncrna-mediated pcd and diseases. here, we developed lncpcd, a comprehensive database that provides information on experimentally supported associations of lncrna-mediated pcd with diseases. the current version of lncpcd documents 6666 associations between five common types of pcd (apoptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis) and 1222 lncrnas in 331 diseases. we also manually curated a wealth of information: (1) 7 important lncrna regulatory mechanisms, (2) 310 pcd-associated cell types in three species, (3) detailed information on lncrna subcellular locations and (4) clinical applications for lncrna-mediated pcd in diseases. additionally, 10 single-cell sequencing datasets were integrated into lncpcd to characterize the dynamics of lncrnas in diseases. overall, lncpcd is an extremely useful resource for understanding the functions and mechanisms of lncrna-mediated pcd in diseases. database url: http://spare4.hospital.studio:9000/lncpcd/home.jsp",AB_0215
"motivation microbes are essential components in the ecosystem and participate in most biological procedures in environments. the high-throughput sequencing technologies help researchers directly quantify the abundance of microbes in a natural environment. microbiome studies explore the construction, stability, and function of microbial communities with the aid of sequencing technology. however, sequencing technologies only provide relative abundances of microbes, and this kind of data is called compositional data in statistics. the constraint of the constant-sum requires flexible statistical methods for analyzing microbiome data. current statistical analysis of compositional data mainly focuses on one compositional vector such as bacterial communities. the fungi are also an important component in microbial communities and are always measured by sequencing internal transcribed spacer instead of 16s rrna genes for bacteria. the different sequencing methods between fungi and bacteria bring two compositional vectors in microbiome studies.results we propose a novel statistical method, called gmcoda, based on an additive logistic normal distribution for estimating the partial correlation matrix for cross-domain interactions. a majorization-minimization algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem involved in gmcoda. through simulation studies, gmcoda is demonstrated to work well in estimating partial correlations between two compositional vectors. gmcoda is also applied to infer cross-domain interactions in a real microbiome dataset and finds potential interactions between bacteria and fungi.availability and implementation gmcoda is open source and freely available from https://github.com/huayingfang/gmcoda under gnu lgpl v3.",AB_0215
"cellular activities are carried out vastly by protein complexes but large repertoire of protein complexes remains functionally uncharacterized which necessitate new strategies to delineate their roles in various cellular processes and diseases. thermal proximity co-aggregation (tpca) is readily deployable to characterize protein complex dynamics in situ and at scale. we develop a version termed slim-tpca that uses fewer temperatures increasing throughputs by over 3x, with new scoring metrics and statistical evaluation that result in minimal compromise in coverage and detect more relevant complexes. less samples are needed, batch effects are minimized while statistical evaluation cost is reduced by two orders of magnitude. we applied slim-tpca to profile k562 cells under different duration of glucose deprivation. more protein complexes are found dissociated, in accordance with the expected downregulation of most cellular activities, that include 55s ribosome and respiratory complexes in mitochondria revealing the utility of tpca to study protein complexes in organelles. protein complexes in protein transport and degradation are found increasingly assembled unveiling their involvement in metabolic reprogramming during glucose deprivation. in summary, slim-tpca is an efficient strategy for characterization of protein complexes at scale across cellular conditions, and is available as python package at https://pypi.org/project/slim-tpca/. vast majority of cellular activities are carried out by protein complexes that assembled dynamically in response to cellular needs and environmental cues. here, the authors present slim-tpca, an effective and readily deployable strategy to unravel the functional roles of protein complexes en masse across various cellular processes.",AB_0215
"due to the high dimensionality and sparsity of the gene expression matrix in single-cell rna-sequencing (scrna-seq) data, coupled with significant noise generated by shallow sequencing, it poses a great challenge for cell clustering methods. while numerous computational methods have been proposed, the majority of existing approaches center on processing the target dataset itself. this approach disregards the wealth of knowledge present within other species and batches of scrna-seq data. in light of this, our paper proposes a novel method named graph-based deep embedding clustering (gdec) that leverages transfer learning across species and batches. gdec integrates graph convolutional networks, effectively overcoming the challenges posed by sparse gene expression matrices. additionally, the incorporation of dec in gdec enables the partitioning of cell clusters within a lower-dimensional space, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of noise on clustering outcomes. gdec constructs a model based on existing scrna-seq datasets and then applying transfer learning techniques to fine-tune the model using a limited amount of prior knowledge gleaned from the target dataset. this empowers gdec to adeptly cluster scrna-seq data cross different species and batches. through cross-species and cross-batch clustering experiments, we conducted a comparative analysis between gdec and conventional packages. furthermore, we implemented gdec on the scrna-seq data of uterine fibroids. compared results obtained from the seurat package, gdec unveiled a novel cell type (epithelial cells) and identified a notable number of new pathways among various cell types, thus underscoring the enhanced analytical capabilities of gdec.availability and implementation: https://github.com/yuzhisun/gdec/tree/main",AB_0215
"today, pharmaceutical industry faces great pressure to employ more efficient and systematic ways in drug discovery and development process. however, conventional formulation studies still strongly rely on personal experiences by trial-and-error experiments, resulting in a labor-consuming, tedious and costly pipeline. thus, it is highly required to develop intelligent and efficient methods for formulation development to keep pace with the progress of the pharmaceutical industry. here, we developed a comprehensive web-based platform (formulationai) for in silico formulation design. first, the most comprehensive datasets of six widely used drug formulation systems in the pharmaceutical industry were collected over 10 years, including cyclodextrin formulation, solid dispersion, phospholipid complex, nanocrystals, self-emulsifying and liposome systems. then, intelligent prediction and evaluation of 16 important properties from the six systems were investigated and implemented by systematic study and comparison of different ai algorithms and molecular representations. finally, an efficient prediction platform was established and validated, which enables the formulation design just by inputting basic information of drugs and excipients. formulationai is the first freely available comprehensive web-based platform, which provides a powerful solution to assist the formulation design in pharmaceutical industry. it is available at https://formulationai.computpharm.org/.",AB_0215
"motivation: medical genomics faces significant challenges in interpreting disease phenotype and genetic heterogeneity. despite the establishment of standardized disease phenotype databases, computational methods for predicting gene-phenotype associations still suffer from imbalanced category distribution and a lack of labeled data in small categories. results: to address the problem of labeled-data scarcity, we propose a self-supervised learning strategy for gene-phenotype association prediction, called sslpheno. our approach utilizes an attributed network that integrates protein-protein interactions and gene ontology data. we apply a laplacian-based filter to ensure feature smoothness and use self-supervised training to optimize node feature representation. specifically, we calculate the cosine similarity of feature vectors and select positive and negative sample nodes for reconstruction training labels. we employ a deep neural network for multi-label classification of phenotypes in the downstream task. our experimental results demonstrate that sslpheno outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in categories with fewer annotations. moreover, our case studies illustrate the potential of sslpheno as an effective prescreening tool for gene-phenotype association identification. availability and implementation: https://github.com/bixuehua/sslpheno.",AB_0215
"in the biomedical field, the efficacy of most drugs is demonstrated by their interactions with targets, meanwhile, accurate prediction of the strength of drug-target binding is extremely important for drug development efforts. traditional bioassay-based drug-target binding affinity (dta) prediction methods cannot meet the needs of drug r&d in the era of big data. recent years we have witnessed significant success on deep learning-based models for drug-target binding affinity prediction task. however, these models only considered a single modality of drug and target information, and some valuable information was not fully utilized. in fact, the information of different modalities of drug and target can complement each other, and more valuable information can be obtained by fusing the information of different modalities. in this paper, we introduce a multimodal information fusion model for dta prediction that is called fmdta, which fully considers drug/target information in both string and graph modalities and balances the feature representations of different modalities by a contrastive learning approach. in addition, we exploited the alignment information of drug atoms and target residues to capture the positional information of string patterns, which can extract more useful feature information in smiles and target sequences. experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that fmdta outperforms the state-of-the-art model, demonstrating the feasibility and excellent feature capture capability of fmdta. the code of fmdta and the data are available at: https://github.com/bestdoublelin/fmdta.",AB_0215
"background: for the patients with acute coronary syndrome (acs) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (pci), dual antiplatelet therapy (dapt) for at least 1 year is recommended in the guidelines to minimize the risk of stent thrombosis. persistently uncovered stent strut means delayed neointima formation and extend the window of time in which the stent is prone to thrombosis. previous studies showed that statins could improve post-stenting strut endothelial coverage for patients undergoing pci. however, there are lack of evidences on whether early initiation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody (pcsk9mab) after pci in acs patients can further improve the rate of stent strut coverage on the background of oral lipid-lowering therapy (llt). methods: this is a single-center, randomized trial to enroll 36 patients undergoing pci with a clinical diagnosis of non-st-segment elevation acs. the baseline level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) of these patients are between 1.4 mmol/l and 3.4 mmol/l. patients will be assigned to intensive lipid-lowering therapy (llt) with pcsk9mab group and conventional llt without pcsk9mab group for 12 weeks in a clinical follow-up setting according to 1: 1 randomization. the rate of stent strut endothelial coverage by optical coherence tomography (oct) examination at 12 weeks after enrollment between the groups will be compared. conclusion: this will be the first study to investigate changes in the rate of stent strut endothelial coverage under intensive llt with pcsk9mab by oct examination in acs patients undergoing pci. the finding of this study will provide clinical evidence for future research about the hypothesis of a novel strategy of intensive llt (pcsk9mab + statin +/- ezetimibe) combined with shortened dapt duration for acs patients undergoing pci.clinical trial registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. unique identifier: chictr2200063395.",AB_0215
