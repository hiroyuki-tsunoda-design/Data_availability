"understanding the evolution of mobile genes is important for understanding the spread of antimicrobial resistance (amr). many clinically important amr genes have been mobilized by mobile genetic elements (mges) on the kilobase scale, such as integrons and transposons, which can integrate into both chromosomes and plasmids and lead to rapid spread of the gene through bacterial populations. looking at the flanking regions of these mobile genes in diverse genomes can highlight common structures and reveal patterns of mge spread. however, historically this has been a largely descriptive process, relying on gene annotation and expert knowledge. here we describe a general method to visualize and quantify the structural diversity around genes using pangraph to find blocks of homologous sequence. we apply this method to a set of 12 clinically important beta-lactamase genes and provide interactive visualizations of their flanking regions at https://liampshaw.github.io/flanking-regions. we show that nucleotide-level variation in the mobile gene itself generally correlates with increased structural diversity in its flanking regions, demonstrating a relationship between rates of mutational evolution and rates of structural evolution, and find a bias for greater structural diversity upstream. our framework is a starting point to investigate general rules that apply to the horizontal spread of new genes through bacterial populations.",AB_0435
"non-technical summary - fossil soft-bodied worms such as nematodes are rare, and, because they often have few features preserved, difficult to interpret. a number of worm-like specimens from the late carboniferous mazon creek fossil site were originally identified as a species of free-living nematode, called nemavermes mackeei, which was among the oldest and largest fossil free-living nematodes. here we reinvestigate these specimens, and determine that they encompass multiple species, including worms (but not free-living nematode worms) and cyclostome fish. in particular, some of these specimens belong to a new species of cyclostome fish, which we name squirmarius testai. nemavermes mackeei schram, 1973, found in the mazon creek fossil site and the bear gulch limestone, was described initially as a free-living marine nematode. here we investigate 13 specimens of n. mackeei from the mazon creek to reassess its morphology and identity, and also two specimens originally identified as gilpichthys greenei bardack and richardson, 1977. based on the extensive morphological variation among these specimens, n. mackeei encompasses multiple species that are only distantly related. the holotype of n. mackeei is a proboscis of tullimonstrum gregarium richardson, 1966, making n. mackeei a junior synonym of t. gregarium. however, the other specimens that we investigated could not be attributed to t. gregarium. we name a new species from these specimens: squirmarius testai new genus new species, a cyclostome. one specimen is likely a juvenile g. greenei. other specimens were not identified during this study but represent a variety of vermiform bilaterians. uuid: http://zoobank.org/d8c63f6a-0ef4-4a34-8dbd-c1d9099589cc",AB_0435
"motivation cell type identification plays an important role in the analysis and interpretation of single-cell data and can be carried out via supervised or unsupervised clustering approaches. supervised methods are best suited where we can list all cell types and their respective marker genes a priori, while unsupervised clustering algorithms look for groups of cells with similar expression properties. this property permits the identification of both known and unknown cell populations, making unsupervised methods suitable for discovery. success is dependent on the relative strength of the expression signature of each group as well as the number of cells. rare cell types therefore present a particular challenge that is magnified when they are defined by differentially expressing a small number of genes.results typical unsupervised approaches fail to identify such rare subpopulations, and these cells tend to be absorbed into more prevalent cell types. in order to balance these competing demands, we have developed a novel statistical framework for unsupervised clustering, named rarity, that enables the discovery process for rare cell types to be more robust, consistent, and interpretable. we achieve this by devising a novel clustering method based on a bayesian latent variable model in which we assign cells to inferred latent binary on/off expression profiles. this lets us achieve increased sensitivity to rare cell populations while also allowing us to control and interpret potential false positive discoveries. we systematically study the challenges associated with rare cell type identification and demonstrate the utility of rarity on various imc datasets.availability and implementation implementation of rarity together with examples is available from the github repository (https://github.com/kasparmartens/rarity).",AB_0435
"circular dichroism (cd) spectroscopy is a widely-used method for characterizing individual protein structures in solutions, membranes, films and macromolecular complexes, as well as for probing macromolecular interactions, conformational changes associated with binding substrates, and in different functionally-related environments. this paper describes a series of related computational and display tools that have been developed over many years to aid in those characterizations and functional interpretations. the new dichropipeline described herein links a series of format-compatible data processing, analysis, and display tools to enable users to facilely produce the spectra, which can then be made available in the protein circular dichroism data bank (https://pcddb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/) resource, in which the cd spectral and associated metadata for each entry are linked to other structural and functional data bases including the protein data bank (pdb), and the uniprot sequence data base, amongst others. these tools and resources thus provide the basis for a wide range of traceable structural characterizations of soluble, membrane and intrinsically-disordered proteins.",AB_0435
"selenzyme is a retrobiosynthesis tool that suggests candidate enzymes for user query reactions. enzyme suggestions are based on identical reactions, as well as similar reactions, since enzymes are often capable of promiscuous substrate binding. selenzyme is a user-friendly, widely used web-tool for ranking enzymes based on reaction similarity and additional features, including the phylogenetic distance between the source species of the enzyme and the intended host. while selenzyme has proved invaluable in assisting with enzyme selection for known reactions, as well as many novel or orphan reactions, weaknesses have been exposed in its ability to rank functionally related enzymes. within this update, we introduce a new reaction similarity scoring algorithm, which is used in conjunction with the previous similarity calculation, to improve the accuracy of enzyme suggestions based on non-identical similar reactions, across a range of ec reaction classes. this allows enzymes to be suggested for reactions not found within the database, even if the reaction is unbalanced. a database update was also carried out, to ensure that reaction and enzyme knowledge remains current. this update can be accessed at http://selenzymerf.synbiochem.co.uk/.",AB_0435
"background alzheimer's disease and related dementias (adrd) are among the most feared age-related conditions. the aim of this study was to evaluate a brief psychological intervention to promote adaptive coping in older adults experiencing heightened fear of adrd and investigate positive downstream effects on health-related secondary outcomes, including frequency of reported memory failures, psychosocial functioning, and quality of life.methods eighty-one older adults were recruited and randomized into reframe or active control intervention arms. both groups received psycho-education and training in mindful monitoring of fears related to adrd. the reframe group received an additional behavioral activation component intended to disrupt maladaptive avoidant coping (i.e., avoidance) strategies. both groups completed 3-weeks of intervention exercises with accompanying questionnaires (baseline, mid- and post-intervention and 4-week follow-up).results adherence was strong (> 75%). we observed a significant reduction in adrd-related fear and avoidance in both groups. significant reductions were also observed for frequency of self-reported memory failures, anxiety, and depression. depression was significantly reduced in the reframe group compared to the control group. significant increases in participants' ability to participate in social activities and well-being were also observed.conclusions findings suggest that a brief psychological intervention can mitigate adrd-related fears and avoidant coping in older adults, and that benefits extend to broader health-related outcomes including anxiety, depression, social functioning, and well-being. addressing adrd-related fear has implications for healthy aging and risk reduction, as individuals may be more likely to engage in activities that are protective against adrd but were previously avoided.trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04821960.",AB_0435
"the increasing application of tms in research and therapy has spawned an ever-growing number of commercial and non-commercial tms devices and technology development. new ce-marked devices appear at a rate of approximately one every two years, with new fda-approved application of tms occurring at a similar rate. with the resulting complex landscape of tms devices and their application, accessible information about the technological characteristics of the tms devices, such as the type of their circuitry, their pulse characteristics, or permitted protocols would be beneficial. we here present an overview and open access database summarizing key features and applications of available commercial and non-commercial tms devices (http://www.tmsbase.info). this may guide comparison and decision making about the use of these devices. a bibliometric analysis was performed by identifying commercial and non-commercial tms devices from which a comprehensive database was created summarizing their publicly available characteristics, both from a technical and clinical point of view. in this document, we introduce both the commercial devices and prototypes found in the literature. the technical specifications that unify these devices are briefly analysed in two separate tables: power electronics, waveform, protocols, and coil types. in the prototype tms systems, the proposed innovations are focused on improving the treatment regarding the patient: noise cancellation, controllable parameters, and multiple stimulation. this analysis shows that the landscape of tms is becoming increasingly fragmented, with new devices appearing ever more frequently. the review provided here can support development of benchmarking frameworks and comparison between tms systems, inform the choice of tms platforms for specific research and therapeutic applications, and guide future technology development for neuromodulation devices. this standardisation strategy will allow a better end-user choice, with an impact on the tms manufacturing industry and a homogenisation of patient samples in multi-centre clinical studies. as an open access repository, we envisage the database to grow along with the dynamic development of tms devices and applications through community-lead curation.",AB_0435

"relation extraction (re) from large text collections is an important tool for database curation, pathway reconstruction, or functional omics data analysis. in practice, re often is part of a complex data analysis pipeline requiring specific adaptations like restricting the types of relations or the set of proteins to be considered. however, current systems are either non-programmable web sites or research code with fixed functionality. we present pedl+, a user-friendly tool for extracting protein-protein and protein-chemical associations from pubmed articles. pedl+ combines state-of-the-art nlp technology with adaptable ranking and filtering options and can easily be integrated into analysis pipelines. we evaluated pedl+ in two pathway curation projects and found that 59% to 80% of its extractions were helpful. availability and implementation: pedl+ is freely available at https://github.com/leonweber/pedl.",AB_0435
"non-natural amino acids are increasingly used as building blocks in the development of peptide-based drugs as they expand the available chemical space to tailor function, half-life and other key properties. however, while the chemical space of modified amino acids (maas) such as residues containing post-translational modifications (ptms) is potentially vast, experimental methods for measuring the developability properties of maa-containing peptides are expensive and time consuming. to facilitate developability programs through computational methods, we present camsol-ptm, a method that enables the fast and reliable sequence-based prediction of the intrinsic solubility of maa-containing peptides in aqueous solution at room temperature. from a computational screening of 50,000 maa-containing variants of three peptides, we selected five different small-size maas for a total number of 37 peptide variants for experimental validation. we demonstrate the accuracy of the predictions by comparing the calculated and experimental solubility values. our results indicate that the computational screening of maa-containing peptides can extend by over four orders of magnitude the ability to explore the solubility chemical space of peptides and confirm that our method can accurately assess the solubility of peptides containing maas. this method is available as a web server at https://www-cohsoftware.ch.cam.ac.uk/index.php/camsolptm. posttranslationally modified amino acids are crucial in physiology and drug development as they alter physicochemical properties such as the solubility of proteins. here the authors describe camsolptm, a software that accurately predicts the solubility of proteins containing these residues.",AB_0435
