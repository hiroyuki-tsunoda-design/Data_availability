"motivation neuromuscular junction (nmj) structural integrity is crucial for transducing motor neuron signals that initiate skeletal muscle contraction. zebrafish has emerged as a simple and efficient model to study nmj structural morphology and function in the context of developmental neurobiology and neuromuscular diseases. however, methods to quantify nmj morphology from voluminous data of nmj confocal images accurately, rapidly, and reproducibly are lacking.results we developed an imagej macro called nmj analyser to automatically and unbiasedly analyse nmj morphology in zebrafish. from the z-stack of a zebrafish hemisomite, both presynaptic and postsynaptic fluorescently labeled termini at nmjs are extracted from background signal, with larger clusters of termini being segmented into individual termini using an unbiased algorithm. the program then determines whether each presynaptic terminus is co-localized with a postsynaptic terminus and vice versa, or whether it is orphaned, and tabulates the number of orphan and co-localized pre- and postsynaptic termini. the usefulness of this imagej macro plugin will be helpful to quantify nmj parameters in zebrafish, particularly during development and in disease models of neuromuscular diseases. it can enable high-throughput nmj phenotypic screens in the drug discovery process for neuromuscular diseases. it could also be further applied to the investigation of nmj of other developmental systems.availability and implementation nmj analyser is available for download at https://github.com/pattenlab/nmj-analyser.git.",AB_0452
"analyzing different omics data types independently is often too restrictive to allow for detection of subtle, but consistent, variations that are coherently supported based upon different assays. integrating multi-omics data in one model can increase statistical power. however, designing such a model is challenging because different omics are measured at different levels. we developed the inetgrate package (https://bioconductor.org/packages/inetgrate/) that efficiently integrates transcriptome and dna methylation data in a single gene network. applying inetgrate on five independent datasets improved prognostication compared to common clinical gold standards and a patient similarity network approach.",AB_0452
"the planteome project (https://planteome.org/) provides a suite of reference and crop-specific ontologies and an integrated knowledgebase of plant genomics data. the plant genomics data in the planteome has been obtained through manual and automated curation and sourced from more than 40 partner databases and resources. here, we report on updates to the planteome reference ontologies, namely, the plant ontology (po), trait ontology (to), the plant experimental conditions ontology (peco), and integration of species/crop-specific vocabularies from our partners, the crop ontology (co) into the to ontology graph. currently, 11 co vocabularies are integrated into the planteome with the addition of yam, sorghum, and potato since 2018. in addition, the size of the annotation database has increased by 34%, and the number of bioentities (genes, proteins, etc.) from 125 plant taxa has increased by 72%. we developed new tools to facilitate user requests and improvements to the co vocabularies, and to allow fast searching and browsing of po terms and definitions. these enhancements and future changes to automate the to-co mappings and knowledge discovery tools ensure that the planteome will continue to be a valuable resource for plant biology. graphical abstract",AB_0452
"drug repositioning is a faster and more affordable solution than traditional drug discovery approaches. from this perspective, computational drug repositioning using knowledge graphs is a very promising direction. knowledge graphs constructed from drug data and information can be used to generate hypotheses (molecule/drug - target links) through link prediction using machine learning algorithms. however, it remains rare to have a holistically constructed knowledge graph using the broadest possible features and drug characteristics, which is freely available to the community. the oregano knowledge graph aims at filling this gap. the purpose of this paper is to present the oregano knowledge graph, which includes natural compounds related data. the graph was developed from scratch by retrieving data directly from the knowledge sources to be integrated. we therefore designed the expected graph model and proposed a method for merging nodes between the different knowledge sources, and finally, the data were cleaned. the knowledge graph, as well as the source codes for the etl process, are openly available on the github of the oregano project (https://gitub.u-bordeaux.fr/erias/oregano).",AB_0452
"muscle-driven simulations have provided valuable insights in studies of walking and running, but a set of freely available simulations and corresponding experimental data for cycling do not exist. the aim of this work was to develop a set of muscle-driven simulations of cycling and to validate them by comparison with experimental data. we used direct collocation to generate simulations of 16 participants cycling over a range of powers (40-216 w) and cadences (75-99 rpm) using two optimization objectives: a baseline objective that minimized muscle effort and a second objective that additionally minimized tibiofemoral joint forces. we tested the accuracy of the simulations by comparing the timing of active muscle forces in our baseline simulation to timing in experimental electromyography data. adding a term in the objective function to minimize tibiofemoral forces preserved cycling power and kinematics, improved similarity between active muscle force timing and experimental electromyography, and decreased tibiofemoral joint reaction forces, which better matched previously reported in vivo measurements. the musculoskeletal models, muscle-driven simulations, simulation software, and experimental data are freely shared at https://simtk.org/projects/cycling_sim for others to reproduce these results and build upon this research.",AB_0452
"motivation phylogenetic placement enables phylogenetic analysis of massive collections of newly sequenced dna, when de novo tree inference is too unreliable or inefficient. assuming that a high-quality reference tree is available, the idea is to seek the correct placement of the new sequences in that tree. recently, alignment-free approaches to phylogenetic placement have emerged, both to circumvent the need to align the new sequences and to avoid the calculations that typically follow the alignment step. a promising approach is based on the inference of k-mers that can be potentially related to the reference sequences, also called phylo-k-mers. however, its usage is limited by the time and memory-consuming stage of reference data preprocessing and the large numbers of k-mers to consider.results we suggest a filtering method for selecting informative phylo-k-mers based on mutual information, which can significantly improve the efficiency of placement, at the cost of a small loss in placement accuracy. this method is implemented in ipk, a new tool for computing phylo-k-mers that significantly outperforms the software previously available. we also present epik, a new software for phylogenetic placement, supporting filtered phylo-k-mer databases. our experiments on real-world data show that epik is the fastest phylogenetic placement tool available, when placing hundreds of thousands and millions of queries while still providing accurate placements.availability and implementation ipk and epik are freely available at https://github.com/phylo42/ipk and https://github.com/phylo42/epik. both are implemented in c++ and python and supported on linux and macos.",AB_0452
"objectives to estimate the association between ssc clinical phenotypes and quantitative occupational exposure to crystalline silica, chlorinated solvents, trichloroethylene and pesticides using job-exposure matrices.methods in the viss-exposition transversal study, data on declarative occupational exposure to crystalline silica, solvents and pesticides were retrieved. in parallel, the lifetime occupational history was evaluated using a questionnaire and cursus laboris for ssc patients followed at bordeaux university hospital (france). using job-exposure matrices, we assessed patients' occupational exposure in relation to relevant clinical phenotypic forms of the disease.results toxic exposure to crystalline silica and pesticides is underestimated by patients. non-biased job-exposure matrices retrieved more exposed patients than the declarative assessment (10.1% of patients by job-exposure matrices vs 6.3% by declaration for crystalline silica and 25.9% vs 12.2% for pesticides). patients overestimate their solvent exposure (7.9% for chlorinated solvents and 4.8% for trichlorethylene assessed by job-exposure matrices and 24.4% declarative exposure to solvents at large). clinical form evaluation revealed a non-significant trend toward an increased risk of crystalline silica occupational exposure in the pulmonary fibrotic group of ssc patients [odds ratio (or) 3.12 (95% ci 0.80, 12.15)]. we also observed a non-significant trend toward an elevated or ([2.89 (95% ci 0.93, 8.95)] for chlorinated solvent occupational exposure and the vascular phenotype of ssc. of note, pesticide occupational exposure evaluation represents one of the largest to date in ssc patients.conclusion this study emphasizes that many exposed ssc patients are unaware of their occupational exposure. job-exposure matrices allow better exposure screening for ssc secondary prevention and occupational exposure compensation.clinical trial registration clinicaltrials.gov (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov), nct03543956",AB_0452
"international cancer registries make real-world genomic and clinical data available, but their joint analysis remains a challenge. aacr project genie, an international cancer registry collecting data from 19 cancer centers, makes data from >130,000 patients publicly available through the cbioportal for cancer genomics (https://genie.cbioportal.org). for 25,000 patients, additional real-world longitudinal clinical data, including treatment and outcome data, are being collected by the aacr project genie biopharma collaborative using the prissmm data curation model. several thousand of these cases are now also available in cbioportal. we have significantly enhanced the functionalities of cbioportal to support the visualization and analysis of this rich clinico-genomic linked dataset, as well as datasets generated by other centers and consortia. examples of these enhancements include (i) visualization of the longitudinal clinical and genomic data at the patient level, including timelines for diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes; (ii) the ability to select samples based on treatment status, facilitating a comparison of molecular and clinical attributes between samples before and after a specific treatment; and (iii) survival analysis estimates based on individual treatment regimens received. together, these features provide cbioportal users with a toolkit to interactively investigate complex clinico-genomic data to generate hypotheses and make discoveries about the impact of specific genomic variants on prognosis and therapeutic sensitivities in cancer. significance: enhanced cbioportal features allow clinicians and researchers to effectively investigate longitudinal clinico-genomic data from patients with cancer, which will improve exploration of data from the aacr project genie biopharma collaborative and similar datasets.",AB_0452
"motivated by humans' ability to adapt skills in the learning of new ones, this paper presents adaptnet, an approach for modifying the latent space of existing policies to allow new behaviors to be quickly learned from like tasks in comparison to learning from scratch. building on top of a given reinforcement learning controller, adaptnet uses a two-tier hierarchy that augments the original state embedding to support modest changes in a behavior and further modifies the policy network layers to make more substantive changes. the technique is shown to be effective for adapting existing physics-based controllers to a wide range of new styles for locomotion, new task targets, changes in character morphology and extensive changes in environment. furthermore, it exhibits significant increase in learning efficiency, as indicated by greatly reduced training times when compared to training from scratch or using other approaches that modify existing policies. code is available at https://motion-lab.github.io/adaptnet.",AB_0452
"great progress has been made in estimating 3d human pose and shape from images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters of parametric human models like smpl. however, existing body models have simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their potential use in biomechanics. on the other hand, methods for estimating biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion capture systems and expensive optimization methods. what is needed is a parametric 3d human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure that can be easily posed. to that end, we develop skel, which re-rigs the smpl body model with a biomechanics skeleton. to enable this, we need training data of skeletons inside smpl meshes in diverse poses. we build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons inside smpl meshes from amass sequences. we then learn a regressor from smpl mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. finally, we re-parametrize the smpl mesh with the new kinematic parameters. the resulting skel model is animatable like smpl but with fewer, and biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. we show that skel has more biomechanically accurate joint locations than smpl, and the bones fit inside the body surface better than previous methods. by fitting skel to smpl meshes we are able to upgrade existing human pose and shape datasets to include biomechanical parameters. skel provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. the model, code, and data are available for research at https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de.",AB_0452
