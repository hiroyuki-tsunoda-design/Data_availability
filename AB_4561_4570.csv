"this paper proposes an approach to automate chemistry experiments using robots by translating natural language instructions into robot-executable plans, using large language models together with task and motion planning. adding natural language interfaces to autonomous chemistry experiment systems lowers the barrier to using complicated robotics systems and increases utility for non-expert users, but translating natural language experiment descriptions from users into low-level robotics languages is nontrivial. furthermore, while recent advances have used large language models to generate task plans, reliably executing those plans in the real world by an embodied agent remains challenging. to enable autonomous chemistry experiments and alleviate the workload of chemists, robots must interpret natural language commands, perceive the workspace, autonomously plan multi-step actions and motions, consider safety precautions, and interact with various laboratory equipment. our approach, clairify, combines automatic iterative prompting with program verification to ensure syntactically valid programs in a data-scarce domain-specific language that incorporates environmental constraints. the generated plan is executed through solving a constrained task and motion planning problem using pddlstream solvers to prevent spillages of liquids as well as collisions in chemistry labs. we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning chemistry experiments, with plans successfully executed on a real robot using a repertoire of robot skills and lab tools. specifically, we showcase the utility of our framework in pouring skills for various materials and two fundamental chemical experiments for materials synthesis: solubility and recrystallization. further details about clairify can be found at https://ac-rad.github.io/clairify/.",AB_0457
"in the field of drug discovery, there is a substantial challenge in seeking out chemical structures that possess desirable pharmacological, toxicological, and pharmacokinetic properties. complications arise when drugs interfere with the functioning of cardiac ion channels, leading to serious cardiovascular consequences. the discontinuation and removal of numerous approved drugs from the market or at late development stages in the pipeline due to such inhibitory effects further highlight the urgency of addressing this issue. consequently, the early prediction of potential blockers targeting cardiac ion channels during the drug discovery process is of paramount importance. this study introduces a deep learning framework that computationally determines the cardiotoxicity associated with the voltage-gated potassium channel (herg), the voltage-gated calcium channel (cav1.2), and the voltage-gated sodium channel (nav1.5) for drug candidates. the predictive capabilities of three feature representations-molecular fingerprints, descriptors, and graph-based numerical representations-are rigorously benchmarked. additionally, a novel training and evaluation data set framework is presented, enabling predictive model training of drug off-target cardiotoxicity using a comprehensive and large curated data set covering these three cardiac ion channels. to facilitate these predictions, a robust and comprehensive small molecule cardiotoxicity prediction tool named ctoxpred has been developed. it is made available as open source under the permissive mit license at https://github.com/issararab/ctoxpred.",AB_0457

"the soybean cyst nematode (scn) is a devastating pathogen for economic and food security considerations. although the scn genome has recently been sequenced, the presence of any mirna has not been systematically explored and reported. this paper describes the development of a species-specific scn mirna discovery pipeline and its application to the scn genome. experiments on well-documented model nematodes (caenorhabditis elegans and pristionchus pacificus) are used to tune the pipeline's hyperparameters and confirm its recall and precision. application to the scn genome identifies 3342 high-confidence putative scn mirna. prediction specificity within scn is confirmed by applying the pipeline to rna hairpins from known exonic regions of the scn genome (i.e., sequences known to not be mirna). prediction recall is confirmed by building a positive control set of scn mirna, based on a limited deep sequencing experiment. interestingly, a number of novel mirna are predicted to be encoded within the intronic regions of effector genes, known to be involved in scn parasitism, suggesting that these mirna may also be involved in the infection process or virulence. beyond mirna discovery, gene targets within scn are predicted for all high-confidence novel mirna using a mirna:mrna target prediction system. lastly, cross-kingdom mirna targeting is investigated, where putative soybean mrna targets are identified for novel scn mirna. all predicted mirna and gene targets are made available in appendix and through a borealis dataverse open repository (https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentid=doi:10.5683/sp3/30dexa).",AB_0457
"background: exposure to opioid analgesics have historically raised concern for a risk of developing opioid use disorder. prescriber audit-and-feedback interventions may reduce opioid prescribing, but some studies have shown detrimental effects for current users. we examined the effectiveness of an audit and feedback intervention, named portrait, to reduce initiation of opioid analgesics among opioid-naive patients experiencing pain. methods: redonna was a single-blinded, two-arm (early vs delayed mailing) randomized trial of a portrait for eligible family physicians (fps) in british columbia (bc), canada. the primary outcome was the change in the number of initiations of opioid analgesic prescriptions written by fps for acute/chronic pain management. we compared outcomes for a 6-month window before vs. after each mailed intervention, using differences in percent differences (dpd) with 95% confidence intervals (ci) and odds ratios (or) from logistic regressions adjusted for clustering of patients by fp. results: in the early (n = 2260) and delayed (n = 2156) groups, opioid initiations per month were the same in the before (2.10 early; 2.06 delayed) and after (1.94 early; 1.95 delayed) windows. the dpd was -2.1% (ci: -4.4% to 0.3%), and ors were: 0.98 (ci: 0.96 to 1.01) for any opioid, 0.97 (ci: 0.94 to 1.01) for codeine (62% of initiations), and 1.0 (ci: 0.97 to 1.07) for tramadol (25% of initiations). there were no differences in mean quantity of tablets, mean milligrams of morphine equivalents (mme), or mean number of days. conclusion: portrait had no impact on fps' rates of prescribing opioid analgesics to opioid-naive patients experiencing pain. trial registration: the study was registered prospectively on 30 march 2020 at the isrctn register (https://www. isrctn.com/isrctn34246811).",AB_0457

"backgroundmajor depressive disorder (mdd) is a prevalent mental health condition affecting millions worldwide, leading to disability and reduced quality of life. mdd poses a global health priority due to its early onset and association with other disabling conditions. available treatments for mdd exhibit varying effectiveness, and a substantial portion of individuals remain resistant to treatment. repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms), applied to the left and/or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlpfc), is an alternative treatment strategy for those experiencing treatment-resistant mdd. the objective of this study is to investigate whether this newer form of rtms, namely theta burst stimulation (tbs), when performed unilaterally or bilaterally, is efficacious in treatment-resistant mdd.methodsin this naturalistic, randomized double-blinded non-inferiority trial, participants with a major depressive episode will be randomized to receive either unilateral (i.e., continuous tbs [ctbs] to the right and sham tbs to the left dlpfc) or bilateral sequential tbs (i.e., ctbs to the right and intermittent tbs [itbs] to the left dlpfc) delivered 5 days a week for 4-6 weeks. responders will move onto a 6-month flexible maintenance phase where tbs treatment will be delivered at a decreasing frequency depending on degree of symptom mitigation. several clinical assessments and neuroimaging and neurophysiological biomarkers will be collected to investigate treatment response and potential associated biomarkers. a non-inferiority analysis will investigate whether bilateral sequential tbs is non-inferior to unilateral tbs and regression analyses will investigate biomarkers of treatment response. we expect to recruit a maximal of 256 participants. this trial is approved by the research ethics board of the royal's institute of mental health research (reb# 2,019,071) and will follow the declaration of helsinki. findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals.discussioncomprehensive assessment of symptoms and neurophysiological biomarkers will contribute to understanding the differential efficacy of the tested treatment protocols, identifying biomarkers for treatment response, and shedding light into underlying mechanisms of tbs. our findings will inform future clinical trials and aid in personalizing treatment selection and scheduling for individuals with mdd.trial registrationthe trial is registered on https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home (#nct04142996).",AB_0457
"over the last two decades, in an effort to engage youth in polar science, the students on ice (soi; https://studentsonice.com/) project has become a platform for youth to partake in scientific expeditions around the globe. among the various activities offered, youth are able to join cruises in the north atlantic or arctic, and drop sealed glass bottles into the ocean. of the thousands that have been deployed, 5% of bottles have been recovered and reported back to soi with details on when and where they were found. here, we compare the observational bottle data with virtual particle trajectories from a high resolution regional ocean model. although modelling results indicate a higher likelihood of bottles reaching the shores of the western atlantic, the majority of recovered bottles were found on the eastern side of the atlantic. we attribute this disparity to differences in population density in canada and europe, biasing the recovery rates. despite this bias, we find that changes in recovery locations over time are consistent with changes in the main ocean currents associated with the contraction and expansion of the north atlantic subpolar gyre, as simulated in our ocean model. in 2007, a large number of bottles were found in norway, coinciding with a contracted north atlantic subpolar gyre during 2004-2008. while between 2012-2016, the majority of bottles were recovered on the british isles, during a time of gyre expansion. these results underline the importance of large scale oceanic cycles for tracking marine debris and pollution, and show how even simple data collection methods, such as drift bottles, can provide clues to the changes in the large scale ocean circulation.",AB_0457
"during the covid-19 pandemic, individuals depended on risk information to make decisions about everyday behaviors and public policy. here, we assessed whether an interactive website influenced individuals' risk tolerance to support public health goals. we collected data from 11,169 unique users who engaged with the online covid-19 event risk tool (https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu/) between 9/22/21 and 1/22/22. the website featured interactive elements, including a dynamic risk map, survey questions, and a risk quiz with accuracy feedback. after learning about the risk of covid-19 exposure, participants reported being less willing to participate in events that could spread covid-19, especially for high-risk large events. we also uncovered a bias in risk estimation: participants tended to overestimate the risk of small events but underestimate the risk of large events. importantly, even participants who voluntarily sought information about covid risks tended to misestimate exposure risk, demonstrating the need for intervention. participants from liberal-leaning counties were more likely to use the website tools and more responsive to feedback about risk misestimation, indicating that political partisanship influences how individuals seek and engage with covid-19 information. lastly, we explored temporal dynamics and found that user engagement and risk estimation fluctuated over the course of the omicron variant outbreak. overall, we report an effective large-scale method for communicating viral exposure risk; our findings are relevant to broader research on risk communication, epidemiological modeling, and risky decision-making.",AB_0457
"we present a new dataset of densely sampled spatio-temporal 4d human motion data of different actors, outfits and motions. the dataset contains different actors wearing different outfits while performing different motions in each outfit. it samples the space of 4d human motion along 3 axes with identity, outfit and motion, therefore providing a cube of data where each identity is represented by a planar slice of the cube with all outfits and for all motions. the dataset has numerous potential applications for the processing and creation of digital humans including augmented reality, avatar creation and virtual try on. 4dhumanoutfit is released for research purposes at https://kinovis.inria.fr/4dhumanoutfit/. in addition to image data and 4d reconstructions, the dataset includes reference solutions for each axis. we present independent baselines along each axis that demonstrate the value of these reference solutions for evaluation tasks.",AB_0457
