"in this paper we present open multi-processing (openmp) fortran 90/95 versions of previously published numerical programs for solving the dipolar gross-pitaevskii (gp) equation including the contact interaction in one, two and three spatial dimensions. the atoms are considered to be polarized along the z axis and we consider different cases, e.g., stationary and non-stationary solutions of the gp equation for a dipolar bose-einstein condensate (bec) in one dimension (along x and z axes), two dimensions (in x -y and x -z planes), and three dimensions. the algorithm used is the split-step semi-implicit crank-nicolson scheme for imaginary-and real-time propagation to obtain stationary states and bec dynamics, respectively, as in the previous version (kishor kumar et al., 2015 [3]). these openmp versions have significantly reduced execution time in multicore processors.new version program summaryprogram title: dbec-gp-omp, a program package containing programs imag3d-th.f90, real3d-th.f90, imag2dxy-th.f90, real2dxy-th.f90, imag2dxz-th.f90, real2dxz-th.f90, imag1dx-th.f90, real1dx-th.f90, imag1dz-th.f90, real1dz-th.f90, with fftw3.f03 and fftw3.mod. cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /sp3wvbtnmh .1licensing provisions: apache license 2.0programming language: open multi-processing (openmp) fortran 90/95. the program is tested with the gnu, intel, and oracle (former sun) compilers. journal reference of previous version: comput. phys. commun. 195 (2015) 117. https://doi .org /10 .1016 /j .cpc . 2015 .03 .024does the new version supersede the previous version?: yes, fortran programsnature of problem: the present openmp fortran 90/95 programs solve the time-dependent nonlinear partial differential gross-pitaevskii (gp) equation for a trapped dipolar bose-einstein condensate (bec) in one (1d), two (2d), and three (3d) spatial dimensions.solution method: we employ the split-step crank-nicolson scheme to discretize the time-dependent gp equation in space and time. the discretized equation is then solved by imaginary-or real-time propagation, employing adequately small space and time steps, to yield the solution of stationary and non-stationary problems, respectively.reason for new version: previously published fortran programs [1] for solving the gp equation for a bec have become useful tools. these programs have been translated to the c programming language [2] and later extended to the more complex scenario of dipolar atoms [3], spinor condensates [4], and rotating condensates [5]. now virtually all computers have multi-core processors and some have motherboards with more than one physical computer processing unit (cpu), which may increase the number of available cpu cores on a single computer to several tens. the fortran [6] and c [7] programs for a nondipolar bec have been adopted to be very fast on such multi-core modern computers. the c programs for a dipolar bec have been adopted to multicore processors to yield openmp, openmp/mpi, and cuda/mpi versions [8, 9].",AB_0412
"motivation: one of the standard methods of high-throughput rna sequencing analysis is differential expression. however, it does not detect changes in molecular regulation. in contrast to the standard differential expression analysis, differential co-expression one aims to detect pairs or clusters whosemutual expression changes between two conditions. results: we developed differential co-expression network analysis (dcona)-an open-source statistical tool that allows one to identify pair interactions, which correlation significantly changes between two conditions. comparing dcona with the state-of-the-art analog, we showed that dcona is a faster, more accurate and less memory-consuming tool. we applied dcona to prostate mrna/mirna-seq data collected from the cancer genome atlas (tcga) and compared predicted regulatory interactions of mirna isoforms (isomirs) and their target mrnas between normal and cancer samples. as a result, almost all highly expressed isomirs lost negative correlation with their targets in prostate cancer samples compared to ones without the pathology. one exception to this trend was the canonical isomir of hsa-mir-93-5p acquiring cancer-specific targets. further analysis showed that cancer aggressiveness simultaneously increased with the expression level of this isomir in both tcga primary tumor samples and 153 blood plasma samples of p. hertsen moscow oncology research institute patients' cohort analyzed by mirna microarrays. availability and implementation: source code and documentation of dcona are available at https://github.com/ zhiyanov/dcona. contact: azhiyanov@hse.ru supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0412
"distracted driving is one of the main causes of deaths and injuries in the world. monitoring driver behaviors through driver action recognition (dar) contributes significantly to building safer transportation systems. however, in naturalistic driving settings, this task is complex and challenging because of numerous difficulties, such as high illumination variation and cluttered and dynamic background. in this paper, we introduce a novel hard attention network that highlights the most pertinent driving-scene information while filtering out irrelevant data. specifically, only local discriminative salient regions are exploited through a hard attention mechanism. the experimental results indicate that our approach significantly enhances dar performance. we evaluated our network on three diverse state-of-the-art datasets recorded in real-world conditions: it achieves up to 95.83% in terms of safe driving recognition and up to 99.07% in terms of distraction detection. the proposed approach outperforms the soft attention-based dar not only in detection and recognition performance but also in computation complexity by 38.71% less runtime. for reproducible research, the code is available at https://github.com/jeghami/hsa-.",AB_0412
"we present aitlas: benchmark arena - an open-source benchmark suite for evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for image classification in earth observation (eo). to this end, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of more than 500 models derived from ten different state-of-the-art architectures and compare them to a variety of multi-class and multi-label classification tasks from 22 datasets with different sizes and properties. in addition to models trained entirely on these datasets, we benchmark models trained in the context of transfer learning, leveraging pre-trained model variants, as it is typically performed in practice. all presented approaches are general and can be easily extended to many other remote sensing image classification tasks not considered in this study. to ensure reproducibility and facilitate better usability and further developments, all of the experimental resources including the trained models, model configurations, and processing details of the datasets (with their corresponding splits used for training and evaluating the models) are publicly available on the repository: https://github.com/biasvariancelabs/aitlas-arena.",AB_0412
"background patient safety is a key concern of anaesthesiology practice. however, good practices are often not widely shared between departments and hospitals, whether within or between countries. objective we aimed to collect and analyse safety practices and tips from anaesthesiology departments around europe in order to facilitate successful transfer of safety knowledge. design review of previously collected safety practices; allocation of numerical scores in order to rank them on 0-5 scales in terms of anticipated impact, and speed, cost, and ease of implementation; free text comment on any possible difficulties or unintended harms which might arise from adopting any of the collected practices. setting collaborative remote working of expert group. participants nineteen experts in patient safety in anaesthesiology from nine european countries. main outcome measures rankings of safety practices for anticipated practice impact, cost, speed, and ease of implementation. results we collected 117 practices. the highest-ranked items for potential beneficial impact were: standardising the layout of drug trolleys (4.82); involving all staff in new safety initiatives in the operating theatre (4.73); ensuring patients' medical records are available at the time of surgery (4.71); running regular simulation training sessions in departments of anaesthesia (4.67); and creating a difficult airway management trolley (4.65). a major theme to emerge from the qualitative analysis of the experts' free text comments was the risk that practices aimed at enhancing patient safety might not achieve the effect intended, as introducing new safety activities can cause more mistakes during the implementation phase. conclusion many useful practices to promote patient safety were identified, but as some practices appear to be context-dependent, we recommend that a proper, prospective risk assessment is carried out before they are introduced in a new setting. the full list of items is available online as supplementary digital content, http://links.lww.com/eja/a785.",AB_0412
"objective though stereotactic radiosurgery (srs) is an established safe treatment for small- and medium-sized vestibular schwannomas (vss), its role in the management of koos grade iv vs is still unclear. in this retrospective multicenter study, the authors evaluated tumor control and the patient outcomes of primary, single-session srs treatment for koos grade iv vs. methods this study included patients treated with primary, single-session srs for koos grade iv vs at 10 participating centers. only those patients presenting with non-life-threatening or incapacitating symptoms and at least 12 months of clinical and neuroimaging follow-up were eligible for inclusion. relevant data were collected, and the kaplan-meier method was used to perform time-dependent analysis for post-srs tumor control, hearing preservation, and facial nerve function preservation. univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for outcome measures using cox regression analysis. results six hundred twenty-seven patients (344 females, median patient age 54 [iqr 22] years) treated with primary nerve weakness (house-brackmann grade > i), and trigeminal neuropathy were present in 205 (33%), 48 (7.7%), and of 38 (iqr 54) months, tumor control was achieved in 94.1% of patients. early tumor expansion occurred in 67 (10.7%) patients and was associated with a loss of tumor control at the last follow-up (p = 0.001). serviceable hearing preserva-tion rates at the 5-and 10-year follow-ups were 65% and 44.6%, respectively. gardner-robertson class > 1 (p = 0.003) and cochlear dose >= 4 gy (p = 0.02) were risk factors for hearing loss. facial nerve function deterioration occurred in 19 (3.0%) patients at the last follow-up and was associated with margin doses >= 13 gy (p = 0.03) and early tumor expansion (p = 0.04). post-srs, 33 patients developed hydrocephalus requiring shunting. adverse radiation effects occurred in 92 patients and were managed medically or surgically in 34 and 18 cases, respectively.conclusions srs is a safe and effective method of obtaining tumor control in patients with koos grade iv vs presenting with non-life-threatening or debilitating symptoms, especially those with surgical comorbidities that contrain-dicate resection. to decrease the incidence of post-srs facial palsy, a prescription dose < 13 gy is recommended. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.4.jns22203",AB_0412
"edge detection is represented as one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision, due to the com-plexity of detecting the edges or boundaries in real-world images that contains objects of different types and scales like trees, building as well as various backgrounds. edge detection is represented also as a key task for many computer vision applications. using a set of backbones as well as attention modules, deep-learning-based methods improved the detection of edges compared with traditional methods like sobel or canny. however, images of complex scenes still represent a challenge for these methods. also, the de-tected edges using the existing approaches suffer from non-refined results with erroneous edges. in this paper, we attempted to overcome these challenges for refined edge detection using a cascaded and high-resolution network named (chrnet). by maintaining the high resolution of edges during the training pro -cess, and conserving the resolution of the edge image during the network stage, sub-blocks are connected at every stage with the output of the previous layer. also, after each layer, we use batch normalization layer with an active affine parameter as an erosion operation for the homogeneous region in the image. the proposed method is evaluated using the most challenging datasets including bsds500, nyud, and multicue. the obtained results outperform the designed edge detection networks in terms of performance metrics and quality of output images.the code is available at: https://github.com/elharroussomar/chrnet/(c) 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0412
"we present our novel deep multi-task learning method for medical image segmentation. existing multi-task methods demand ground truth annotations for both the primary and auxiliary tasks. contrary to it, we propose to generate the pseudo-labels of an auxiliary task in an unsupervised manner. to generate the pseudo-labels, we leverage histogram of oriented gradients (hogs), one of the most widely used and powerful hand-crafted features for detection. together with the ground truth semantic segmentation masks for the primary task and pseudo-labels for the auxiliary task, we learn the parameters of the deep network to minimize the loss of both the primary task and the auxiliary task jointly. we employed our method on two powerful and widely used semantic segmentation networks: unet and u2net to train in a multi-task setup. to validate our hypothesis, we performed experiments on two different medical image segmentation data sets. from the extensive quantitative and qualitative results, we observe that our method consistently improves the performance compared to the counter-part method. moreover, our method is the winner of fetreg endovis sub-challenge on semantic segmentation organised in conjunction with miccai 2021. code and implementation details are available at:https://github.com/thetna/medical_image_segmentation.",AB_0412
"background after covid-19 vaccines received approval, vaccination campaigns were launched worldwide. initially, these were characterized by a shortage of vaccine supply, and specific risk groups were prioritized. once supply was guaranteed and vaccination coverage saturated, the focus shifted from risk groups to anti-vaxxers, the under-aged population, and regions of low coverage. at the same time, hopes to reach herd immunity by vaccination campaigns were put into perspective by the emergence and spread of more contagious and aggressive viral variants. particularly, concerns were raised that not all vaccines protect against the new-emerging variants. the objective of this study is to introduce a predictive model to quantify the effect of vaccination campaigns on the spread of sars-cov-2 viral variants. methods and findings the predictive model introduced here is a comprehensive extension of the one underlying the pandemic preparedness tool covidsim 2.0 (http://covidsim.eu/). the model is age and spatially stratified, incorporates a finite (but arbitrary) number of different viral variants, and incorporates different vaccine products. the vaccines are allowed to differ in their vaccination schedule, vaccination rates, the onset of vaccination campaigns, and their effectiveness. these factors are also age and/or location dependent. moreover, the effectiveness and the immunizing effect of vaccines are assumed to depend on the interaction of a given vaccine and viral variant. importantly, vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. individuals can be immunized completely, only partially, or fail to be immunized against one or many viral variants. not all individuals in the population are vaccinable. the model is formulated as a high-dimensional system of differential equations, which is implemented efficiently in the programming language julia. as an example, the model was parameterized to reflect the epidemic situation in germany until november 2021 and future dynamics of the epidemic under different interventions were predicted. in particular, without tightening contact reductions, a strong epidemic wave is predicted during december 2021 and january 2022. provided the dynamics of the epidemic in germany, in late 2021 administration of full-dose vaccination to all eligible individuals (e.g. by mandatory vaccination) would be too late to have a strong effect on reducing the number of infections in the fourth wave in germany. however, it would reduce mortality. an emergency brake, i.e., an incidence-based stepwise lockdown, would be efficient to reduce the number of infections and mortality. furthermore, to specifically account for mobility between regions, the model was applied to two german provinces of particular interest: saxony, which currently has the lowest vaccine rollout in germany and high incidence, and schleswig-holstein, which has high vaccine rollout and low incidence. conclusions a highly sophisticated and flexible but easy-to-parameterize model for the ongoing covid-19 pandemic is introduced. the model is capable of providing useful predictions for the covid-19 pandemic, and hence provides a relevant tool for epidemic decision-making. the model can be adjusted to any country, and the predictions can be used to derive the demand for hospital or icu capacities.",AB_0412
"backgroundsoil-transmitted helminthes (sths) are the major public health problems that affect the health of pregnant women and their incoming newborns. in ethiopia, about 33.35% of pregnant women were affected by these infections. utilization of deworming medication during pregnancy is the main strategy endorsed by the world health organization (who) to reduce the burden of sth-induced anemia and its related complications. however, information related to the coverage and its individual as well as community-level factors on the utilization of deworming medication among pregnant mothers with at least one antenatal care (anc) visit is limited in ethiopia.methodsa nationwide population-based cross-sectional study was conducted from january 18 to june 27, 2016. the information was obtained from the 2016 ethiopian demographic health survey (edhs 2016), which can be accessed at: https://www.dhsprogram.com. a weighted sample of 4690 pregnant women selected using a two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique was included in the final analysis. a multi-variable multilevel binary logistic regression model was fitted to identify the determinants of the utilization of deworming medication during pregnancy. log-likelihood ration (llr), deviance and akaike's information criterion (aic) were used to select the best fitted model in the multilevel analysis. statistical significance was declared at p-value <0.05.resultfrom a total of 4690 mothers included in the final analysis, only 365 (7.8%) of them utilized deworming medication in pregnancy. after controlling for confounding effects, having four or more antenatal care (anc) visits, having functional working status, intake of iron folic acid (ifa) tablets and coming from a community with a low poverty level increases the odds of utilization of deworming medication during pregnancy.conclusion and recommendationin this study, less than one in ten pregnant mothers takes deworming medication. mothers with less than four anc visits, who did not receive ifa tablets, who came from a community with a high poverty level, and mothers with no good functional status were at the greatest risk of not receiving deworming medication during pregnancy. sustained efforts need to be undertaken to increase the socioeconomic status of the community and to scale up the health care utilization behaviors of pregnant mothers.",AB_0412
