(2022). idiosyncratic effects of coinfection on the association between systemic pathogens and the gut microbiota of a wild rodent, the bank vole (myodes glareolus). journal of animal ecology, https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.13869. interactions between pathogens and host-associated microbial communities can influence host fitness, disease progression and pathogen emergence. the vast majority of studies characterize interactions between single pathogens and bacterial commensals, yet co-infections with multiple pathogens are the norm in nature. in their paper on pathogen-microbiome interactions, brila et al. (2022) examine how co-infections with four systemic pathogens associate with the gut microbiota in wild bank voles. building on a series of tests, the authors show that excluding co-infection information from statistical models masks pathogen-specific patterns and confounds interpretations. this paper advances on previous studies by generating surveillance data on a phylogenetically diverse suite of vole pathogens to address the question as to whether pathogens exhibit unique or universal associations with gut commensals. they report that even bacterial pathogens with similar transmission ecology have divergent associations with gut microbes, and highlight that a mechanistic understanding of host-pathogen interactions is necessary for decoding the diverse consequences for gut microbial communities.",AB_0447
"the increase in microbial sequenced genomes from pure cultures and metagenomic sam-ples reflects the current attainability of whole-genome and shotgun sequencing methods. however, software for genome visualization still lacks automation, integration of different analyses, and customizable options for non-experienced users. in this study, we introduce genovi, a python command-line tool able to create custom circular genome representations for the analysis and visualization of microbial genomes and sequence elements. it is designed to work with complete or draft genomes, featuring customizable options including 25 different built-in color palettes (including 5 color-blind safe palettes), text formatting options, and automatic scaling for complete genomes or sequence elements with more than one replicon/sequence. using a genbank format file as the input file or multiple files within a directory, genovi (i) visualizes genomic features from the genbank annotation file, (ii) inte-grates a cluster of orthologs group (cog) categories analysis using deepnog, (iii) auto-matically scales the visualization of each replicon of complete genomes or multiple sequence elements, (iv) and generates cog histograms, cog frequency heatmaps and output tables including general stats of each replicon or contig processed. genovi's poten-tial was assessed by analyzing single and multiple genomes of bacteria and archaea. para-burkholderia genomes were analyzed to obtain a fast classification of replicons in large multipartite genomes. genovi works as an easy-to-use command-line tool and provides customizable options to automatically generate genomic maps for scientific publications, educational resources, and outreach activities. genovi is freely available and can be down-loaded from https://github.com/robotod/genovi.",AB_0447
"objective proton beam therapy (pbt) is an increasingly used treatment modality for pediatric patients with brain tumors. moyamoya syndrome (mms) is well recognized as a complication of traditional photon radiotherapy, however its association with pbt is less well described. the authors discuss their initial experience with the neurosurgical manage-ment of mms secondary to pbt in a large-volume pediatric neurovascular service.methods the authors performed a retrospective case review of consecutive children referred for neurosurgical man-agement of mms after pbt between 2009 and 2022. patient demographic characteristics, oncological history and treat-ment, interval between pbt and mms diagnosis, and mms management were recorded. clinical outcome at last review was classified as good if the modified rankin scale (mrs) score was <= 2 and/or the patient attended mainstream educa- tion without additional assistance. poor outcome was defined as mrs score >= 3 and/or the patient received additional educational support. the recorded radiological outcomes included angiographic analysis of stenosis, evidence of brain ischemia/infarction on mri, and postsurgical angiographic revascularization.results ten patients were identified. oncological diagnosis included craniopharyngioma (n = 6), optic pathway glioma (1), ependymoma (1), ewing sarcoma (1), and rhabdosarcoma (1). the median (interquartile range [iqr]) age at pbt was 5.1 (2.7-7.9) years. the median (iqr) age at mms diagnosis was 7.8 (5.7-9.3) years. the median time be-tween pbt and diagnosis of mms was 20 (15-41) months. six patients had poor functional status after initial oncologi-cal treatment and prior to diagnosis of mms. all 10 patients had endocrine dysfunction, 8 had visual impairment, and 4 had behavioral issues prior to mms diagnosis. four patients had a perioperative ischemic event: 2 after tumor surgery, 1 after mms surgical revascularization, and 1 after receiving a general anesthetic for an mri scan during oncological surveillance. seven children were treated with surgical revascularization, whereas 3 were managed medically. the inci-dence of ischemic events per cerebral hemisphere was reduced after surgical revascularization: only 1 patient of 7 had an ischemic event during the follow-up period after surgery. no children moved from good to poor functional status after mms diagnosis.conclusions mms can occur after pbt. magnetic resonance angiography sequences should be included in sur-veillance mri scans to screen for mms, and families should be counseled about this complication. management at a high-volume pediatric neurovascular center, including selective use of revascularization surgery, appears to maintain functional status in these children. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.12.peds22423",AB_0447
"automatic anatomical landmark localization has made great strides by leveraging deep learning methods in recent years. the ability to quantify the uncertainty of these predictions is a vital component needed for these methods to be adopted in clinical settings, where it is imperative that erroneous predictions are caught and corrected. we propose quantile binning, a data-driven method to categorize predictions by uncertainty with estimated error bounds. our framework can be applied to any continuous uncertainty measure, allowing straightforward identification of the best subset of predictions with accompanying estimated error bounds. we facilitate easy comparison between uncertainty measures by constructing two evaluation metrics derived from quantile binning. we compare and contrast three epistemic uncertainty measures (two baselines, and a proposed method combining aspects of the two), derived from two heatmap-based landmark localization model paradigms (u-net and patch-based). we show results across three datasets, including a publicly available cephalometric dataset. we illustrate how filtering out gross mispredictions caught in our quantile bins significantly improves the proportion of predictions under an acceptable error threshold. finally, we demonstrate that quantile binning remains effective on landmarks with high aleatoric uncertainty caused by inherent landmark ambiguity, and offer recommendations on which uncertainty measure to use and how to use it. the code and data are available at https://github.com/schobs/qbin.",AB_0447
"an important goal of medical imaging is to be able to precisely detect patterns of disease specific to individual scans; however, this is challenged in brain imaging by the degree of heterogeneity of shape and appearance. traditional methods, based on image registration, historically fail to detect variable features of disease, as they utilise population-based analyses, suited primarily to studying group-average effects. in this paper we therefore take advantage of recent developments in generative deep learning to develop a method for simultaneous classification, or regression, and feature attribution (fa). specifically, we explore the use of a vae-gan (variational autoencoder - general adversarial network) for translation called icam, to explicitly disentangle class relevant features, from background confounds, for improved interpretability and regression of neurological phenotypes. we validate our method on the tasks of mini-mental state examination (mmse) cognitive test score prediction for the alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (adni) cohort, as well as brain age prediction, for both neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration, using the developing human connectome project (dhcp) and uk biobank datasets. we show that the generated fa maps can be used to explain outlier predictions and demonstrate that the inclusion of a regression module improves the disentanglement of the latent space. our code is freely available on github https://github.com/cherbass/icam.",AB_0447
"in this manuscript, the topic of multi-corpus speech emotion recognition (ser) is approached from a deep transfer learning perspective. a large corpus of emotional speech data, emoset, is assembled from a number of existing speech emotion recognition (ser) corpora. in total, emoset contains 84181 audio recordings from 26 ser corpora with a total duration of over 65 hours. the corpus is then utilised to create a novel framework for multi-corpus ser and general audio recognition, namely emonet. a combination of a deep resnet architecture and residual adapters is transferred from the field of multi-domain visual recognition to multi-corpus ser on emoset. the introduced residual adapter approach enables parameter efficient training of a multi-domain ser model on all 26 corpora. a shared model with only 3.5 times the number of parameters of a model trained on a single database leads to increased performance for 21 of the 26 corpora in emoset. using repeated training runs and almost stochastic order with significance level of a 1/4 0:05, these improvements are further significant for 15 datasets while there are just three corpora that see only significant decreases across the residual adapter transfer experiments. finally, we make our emonet framework publicly available for users and developers at https://github.com/eihw/emonet.",AB_0447
"mirnas are 22 nucleotides long and belong to a class of noncoding rnas that plays an important role in regulating gene expression at a post-transcriptional level. studies show aberrant levels of mirnas to be associated with profibrotic processes in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf). however, most of these studies used whole ipf tissue or in vitro monocultures in which fibrosis was artificially induced. the current study used laser microdissection to collect fibroblastic foci (ff), the key pathologic lesion in ipf, isolated mirnas, and compared their expression levels with those found in whole ipf lung tissue and/or in vitro cultured fibroblast from ipf or normal lungs. sequencing libraries were generated, and data generated were bioinformatically analyzed. a total of 18 mirnas were significantly overexpressed in ff tissue when compared with whole ipf tissue. of those, 15 were unique to ff. comparison of ff with cultured ipf fibroblasts also revealed differences in mirna composition that impacted several signaling pathways. the mirna composition of ff is both overlapping and distinct from that of whole ipf tissue or cultured ipf fibroblasts and highlights the importance of characterizing ff biology as a phenotyp-ically and functionally discrete tissue microenvironment.

"supermassive black holes (smbhs) are a key catalyst of galaxy formation and evolution, leading to an observed correlation between smbh mass m-bh and host galaxy velocity dispersion se. outside the local universe, measurements of m-bh are usually only possible for smbhs in an active state: limiting sample size and introducing selection biases. gravitational lensing makes it possible to measure the mass of non-active smbhs. we present models of the z = 0.169 galaxy-scale strong lens abell 1201. a cd galaxy in a galaxy cluster, it has sufficient 'external shear' that a magnified image of a z = 0.451 background galaxy is projected just similar to 1 kpc from the galaxy centre. using multiband hubble space telescope imaging and the lens modelling software pyautolens, we reconstruct the distribution of mass along this line of sight. bayesian model comparison favours a point mass with m-bh = 3.27 +/- 2.12 x 10(10) m-circle dot (3 sigma confidence limit); an ultramassive black hole. one model gives a comparable bayesian evidence without an smbh; however, we argue this model is nonphysical given its base assumptions. this model still provides an upper limit of m-bh = 5.3 x 10(10) m-circle dot, because an smbh above this mass deforms the lensed image similar to 1 kpc from abell 1201's centre. this builds on previous work using central images to place upper limits on m-bh, but is the first to also place a lower limit and without a central image being observed. the success of this method suggests that surveys during the next decade could measure thousands more smbh masses, and any redshift evolution of the m-bh - sigma(e) relation. results are available at https://github.com/jammy2211/autolens abell 1201.",AB_0447
"previous studies have shown that universal adversarial attacks can fool deep neural networks over a large set of input images with a single human-invisible perturbation. however, current methods for universal adversarial attacks are based on additive perturbation, which enables misclassification by directly adding the perturbation on the input images. in this paper, for the first time, we show that a universal adversarial attack can also be achieved through spatial transformation (non-additive). more importantly, to unify both additive and non-additive perturbations, we propose a novel unified yet flexible framework for universal adversarial attacks, called guap, which can initiate attacks by l(8)-norm (additive) perturbation, spatially-transformed (non-additive) perturbation, or a combination of both. extensive experiments are conducted on two computer vision scenarios, including image classification and semantic segmentation tasks, which contain cifar-10, imagenet and cityscapes datasets with a number of different deep neural network models, including googlenet, vgg16/19, resnet101/152, densenet121, and fcn-8s. empirical experiments demonstrate that guap can obtain higher attack success rates on these datasets compared to state-of-the-art universal adversarial attacks. in addition, we also demonstrate how universal adversarial training benefits the robustness of the model against universal attacks. we release our tool guap on https://github.com/trustai/guap.",AB_0447
"background: surgery for nail bed injuries in children is common. one of the key surgical decisions is whether to replace the nail plate following nail bed repair. the aim of this rct was to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of nail bed repair with fingernail replacement/substitution compared with repair without fingernail replacement. methods: a two-arm 1 : 1 parallel-group open multicentre superiority rct was performed across 20 secondary-care hospitals in the uk. the co-primary outcomes were surgical-site infection at around 7 days after surgery and cosmetic appearance summary score at a minimum of 4 months. results: some 451 children presenting with a suspected nail bed injury were recruited between july 2018 and july 2019; 224 were allocated to the nail-discarded arm, and 227 to the nail-replaced arm. there was no difference in the number of surgical-site infections at around 7 days between the two interventions or in cosmetic appearance. the mean total healthcare cost over the 4 months after surgery was (sic) 84 (95 per cent c.i. 34 to 140) lower for the nail-discarded arm than the nail-replaced arm (p < 0.001). conclusion: after nail bed repair, discarding the fingernail was associated with similar rates of infection and cosmesis ratings as replacement of the finger nail, but was cost saving. registration number: isrctn44551796 (http://www.controlled-trials.com).",AB_0447
