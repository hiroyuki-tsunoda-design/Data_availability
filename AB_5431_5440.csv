"background the ability to predict survival accurately in patients with osseous metastatic disease of the extremities is vital for patient counseling and guiding surgical intervention. we, the skeletal oncology research group (sorg), previously developed a machine-learning algorithm (mla) based on data from 1999 to 2016 to predict 90-day and 1-year survival of surgically treated patients with extremity bone metastasis. as treatment regimens for oncology patients continue to evolve, this sorg mla-driven probability calculator requires temporal reassessment of its accuracy. question/purpose does the sorg-mla accurately predict 90-day and 1-year survival in patients who receive surgical treatment for a metastatic long-bone lesion in a more recent cohort of patients treated between 2016 and 2020? methods between 2017 and 2021, we identified 674 patients 18 years and older through the icd codes for secondary malignant neoplasm of bone and bone marrow and cpt codes for completed pathologic fractures or prophylactic treatment of an impending fracture. we excluded 40% (268 of 674) of patients, including 18% (118) who did not receive surgery; 11% (72) who had metastases in places other than the long bones of the extremities; 3% (23) who received treatment other than intramedullary nailing, endoprosthetic reconstruction, or dynamic hip screw; 3% (23) who underwent revision surgery, 3% (17) in whom there was no tumor, and 2% (15) who were lost to follow-up within 1 year. temporal validation was performed using data on 406 patients treated surgically for bony metastatic disease of the extremities from 2016 to 2020 at the same two institutions where the mla was developed. variables used to predict survival in the sorg algorithm included perioperative laboratory values, tumor characteristics, and general demographics. to assess the models discrimination, we computed the c-statistic, commonly referred to as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (auc) curve for binary classification. this value ranged from 0.5 (representing chance-level performance) to 1.0 (indicating excellent discrimination) generally, an auc of 0.75 is considered high enough for use in clinical practice. to evaluate the agreement between predicted and observed outcomes, a calibration plot was used, and the calibration slope and intercept were calculated. perfect calibration would result in a slope of 1 and intercept of 0. for overall performance, the brier score and null-model brier score were determined. the brier score can range from 0 (representing perfect prediction) to 1 (indicating the poorest prediction). proper interpretation of the brier score necessitates a comparison with the null-model brier score, which represents the score for an algorithm that predicts a probability equal to the population prevalence of the outcome for each patient. finally, a decision curve analysis was conducted to compare the potential net benefit of the algorithm with other decision-support methods, such as treating all or none of the patients. overall, 90-day and 1-year mortality were lower in the temporal validation cohort than in the development cohort (90 day: 23% versus 28%; p < 0.001, and 1 year: 51% versus 59%; p<0.001). results overall survival of the patients in the validation cohort improved from 28% mortality at the 90-day timepoint in the cohort on which the model was trained to 23%, and 59% mortality at the 1-year timepoint to 51%. the auc was 0.78 (95% ci 0.72 to 0.82) for 90-day survival and 0.75 (95% ci 0.70 to 0.79) for 1-year survival, indicating the model could distinguish the two outcomes reasonably. for the 90-day model, the calibration slope was 0.71 (95% ci 0.53 to 0.89), and the intercept was -0.66 (95% ci -0.94 to -0.39), suggesting the predicted risks were overly extreme, and that in general, the risk of the observed outcome was overestimated. for the 1-year model, the calibration slope was 0.73 (95% ci 0.56 to 0.91) and the intercept was -0.67 (95% ci -0.90 to -0.43). with respect to overall performance, the models brier scores for the 90-day and 1-year models were 0.16 and 0.22. these scores were higher than the brier scores of internal validation of the development study (0.13 and 0.14) models, indicating the models performance has declined over time. conclusion the sorg mla to predict survival after surgical treatment of extremity metastatic disease showed decreased performance on temporal validation. moreover, in patients undergoing innovative immunotherapy, the possibility of mortality risk was overestimated in varying severity. clinicians should be aware of this overestimation and discount the prediction of the sorg mla according to their own experience with this patient population. generally, these results show that temporal reassessment of these mla-driven probability calculators is of paramount importance because the predictive performance may decline over time as treatment regimens evolve. the sorg-mla is available as a freely accessible internet application at https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/extremitymetssurvival/.",AB_0544
"objective: exposure to infections during pregnancy may be a potential risk factor for later psychopathology, but large-scale epidemiological studies investigating associations between prenatal infection and long-term offspring behavioral problems in the general population are scarce. in our study, we aimed to investigate the following: (1) the association between prenatal infection and adolescent behavior, (2) putative underlying pathways (mediation), and (3) second hits interacting with prenatal infection to increase the risk of adolescent behavior problems (moderation).method: our study was embedded in a prospective dutch pregnancy cohort (generation r; n 1/4 2,213 motherlchild dyads). we constructed a comprehensive prenatal infection score comprising common infections for each trimester of pregnancy. at age 13 to 16 years, we assessed total, internalizing, and externalizing problems, and autistic traits using the child behavioral checklist and the social responsiveness scale, respectively. we investigated maternal lifestyle and nutrition, perinatal factors (placental health and delivery outcomes), and child health (lifestyle, traumatic events, infections) as mediators and moderators.results: we observed associations of prenatal infection with adolescent total behavioral, internalizing, and externalizing problems. the association between prenatal infection and internalizing problems was moderated by higher levels of maternal psychopathology, alcohol and tobacco use, and a higher number of traumatic childhood events. we found no association between prenatal infection and autistic traits. yet, children exposed to prenatal infections and maternal substance use, and/or traumatic childhood events, had a higher risk of autistic traits in adolescence.conclusion: prenatal infection may be a risk factor for later psychiatric problems as well as a disease primer making individuals susceptible to other hits later in life.study preregistration information: prenatal maternal infection and adverse neurodevelopment: a structural equation modelling approach to downstream environmental hits; https://osf.io/cp85a; cp85a.diversity & inclusion statement: we worked to ensure race, ethnic, and/or other types of diversity in the recruitment of human participants. we worked to ensure that the study questionnaires were prepared in an inclusive way. we worked to ensure sex and gender balance in the recruitment of human participants.",AB_0544
"pangenomics was originally defined as the problem of comparing the composition of genes into gene families within a set of bacterial isolates belonging to the same species. the problem requires the calculation of sequence homology among such genes. when combined with metagenomics, namely for human microbiome composition analysis, gene-oriented pangenome detection becomes a promising method to decipher ecosystem functions and population-level evolution.established computational tools are able to investigate the genetic content of isolates for which a complete genomic sequence is available. however, there is a plethora of incomplete genomes that are available on public resources, which only a few tools may analyze. incomplete means that the process for reconstructing their genomic sequence is not complete, and only fragments of their sequence are currently available. however, the information contained in these fragments may play an essential role in the analyses.here, we present pandelos-frags, a computational tool which exploits and extends previous results in analyzing complete genomes. it provides a new methodology for inferring missing genetic information and thus for managing incomplete genomes. pandelos-frags outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in reconstructing gene families in synthetic benchmarks and in a real use case of metagenomics. pandelos-frags is publicly available at https://github.com/infomics/pandelos-frags.",AB_0544
"we describe a new dataset of cropland area circa the year 2020, with global coverage and with data for 221 countries and territories and 34 regional aggregates. data are generated from geospatial information on the agreement-disagreement characteristics of six open-access high-resolution cropland maps derived from remote sensing. the cropland area mapping (cam) aggregation dataset provides information on (i) mean cropland area and its uncertainty, (ii) cropland area by six distinct cropland agreement classes, and (iii) cropland area by specific combinations of underlying land cover product. the results indicated that world cropland area is 1500 +/- 400 mha (mean and 95 % confidence interval), with a relative uncertainty of 25 % that increased across regions. it was 50 % in central asia (40 +/- 20 mha), south america (180 +/- 80 mha), and southern europe (40 +/- 20 mha) and up to 40 % in australia and new zealand (50 +/- 20 mha), southeastern asia (80 +/- 30 mha), and southern africa (16 +/- 6 mha). conversely, cropland area was estimated with better precision, i.e., smaller uncertainties in the range 10 %-25 % in southern asia (230 +/- 30 mha), northern america (200 +/- 40 mha), northern africa (40 +/- 10 mha), and eastern europe and western europe (40 +/- 10 mha). the new data can be used to investigate the coherence of information across the six underlying products, as well as to explore important disagreement features. overall, 70 % or more of the estimated mean cropland area globally and by region corresponded to good agreement of underlying land cover maps - four or more. conversely, in africa cropland area estimates found significant disagreement, highlighting mapping difficulties in complex landscapes. finally, the new cropland area data were consistent with faostat (fao, 2023) in 15 out of 18 world regions, as well as for 114 out of 182 countries with a cropland area above 10 kha. by helping to highlight features of cropland characteristics and underlying causes for agreement-disagreement across land cover products, the cam aggregation dataset may be used as a reference for the quality of country statistics and may help guide future mapping efforts towards improved agricultural monitoring. data are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7987515 (tubiello et al., 2023a).",AB_0544
"motivation dynamical properties of biochemical pathways (bps) help in understanding the functioning of living cells. their in silico assessment requires simulating a dynamical system with a large number of parameters such as kinetic constants and species concentrations. such simulations are based on numerical methods that can be time-expensive for large bps. moreover, parameters are often unknown and need to be estimated.results we developed a framework for the prediction of dynamical properties of bps directly from the structure of their graph representation. we represent bps as petri nets, which can be automatically generated, for instance, from standard sbml representations. the core of the framework is a neural network for graphs that extracts relevant information directly from the petri net structure and exploits them to learn the association with the desired dynamical property. we show experimentally that the proposed approach reliably predicts a range of diverse dynamical properties (robustness, monotonicity, and sensitivity) while being faster than numerical methods at prediction time. in synergy with the neural network models, we propose a methodology based on petri nets arc knock-out that allows the role of each molecule in the occurrence of a certain dynamical property to be better elucidated. the methodology also provides insights useful for interpreting the predictions made by the model. the results support the conjecture often considered in the context of systems biology that the bp structure plays a primary role in the assessment of its dynamical properties.availability and implementation https://github.com/marcopodda/petri-bio (code), https://zenodo.org/record/7610382 (data).",AB_0544
"the chemical properties of metal complexes are strongly dependent on the number and geometrical arrangement of ligands coordinated to the metal center. existing methods for determining either coordination number or geometry rely on a trade-off between accuracy and computational costs, which hinders their application to the study of large structure data sets. here, we propose metalhawk (https://github.com/vrettasm/metalhawk), a machine learning-based approach to perform simultaneous classification of metal site coordination number and geometry through artificial neural networks (anns), which were trained using the cambridge structural database (csd) and metal protein data bank (metalpdb). we demonstrate that the csd-trained model can be used to classify sites belonging to the most common coordination numbers and geometry classes with balanced accuracy equal to 96.51% for csd-deposited metal sites. the csd-trained model was also found to be capable of classifying bioinorganic metal sites from the metalpdb database, with balanced accuracy equal to 84.29% on the whole pdb data set and to 91.66% on manually reviewed sites in the pdb validation set. moreover, we report evidence that the output vectors of the csd-trained model can be considered as a proxy indicator of metal-site distortions, showing that these can be interpreted as a low-dimensional representation of subtle geometrical features present in metal site structures.",AB_0544
"motivation protein contact networks (pcns) represent the 3d structure of a protein using network formalism. inter-residue contacts are described as binary adjacency matrices, which are derived from the graph representation of residues (as alpha-carbons, beta-carbons or centroids) and euclidean distances according to defined thresholds. functional characterization algorithms are computed on binary adjacency matrices to unveil allosteric, dynamic, and interaction mechanisms in proteins. such strategies are usually applied in a combinatorial manner, although rarely in seamless and user-friendly implementations.results pypcn is a plugin for pymol wrapping more than twenty pcn algorithms and metrics in an easy-to-use graphical user interface, to support pcn analysis. the plugin accepts 3d structures from the protein data bank, user-provided pdbs, or precomputed adjacency matrices. the results are directly mapped to 3d protein structures and organized into interactive diagrams for their visualization. a dedicated graphical user interface combined with pymol visual support makes analysis more intuitive and easier, extending the applicability of pcns.availability and implementation https://github.com/pcnproject/pypcn.",AB_0544
"t-cell receptors (tcrs) on t cells recognize and bind to epitopes presented by the major histocompatibility complex in case of an infection or cancer. however, the high diversity of tcrs, as well as their unique and complex binding mechanisms underlying epitope recognition, make it difficult to predict the binding between tcrs and epitopes. here, we present the utility of transformers, a deep learning strategy that incorporates an attention mechanism that learns the informative features, and show that these models pre-trained on a large set of protein sequences outperform current strategies. we compared three pre-trained auto-encoder transformer models (protbert, protalbert, and protelectra) and one pre-trained auto-regressive transformer model (protxlnet) to predict the binding specificity of tcrs to 25 epitopes from the vdjdb database (human and murine). two additional modifications were performed to incorporate gene usage of the tcrs in the four transformer models. of all 12 transformer implementations (four models with three different modifications), a modified version of the protxlnet model could predict tcr-epitope pairs with the highest accuracy (weighted f1 score 0.55 simultaneously considering all 25 epitopes). the modification included additional features representing the gene names for the tcrs. we also showed that the basic implementation of transformers outperformed the previously available methods, i.e. tcrgp, tcrdist, and deeptcr, developed for the same biological problem, especially for the hard-to-classify labels. we show that the proficiency of transformers in attention learning can be made operational in a complex biological setting like tcr binding prediction. further ingenuity in utilizing the full potential of transformers, either through attention head visualization or introducing additional features, can extend t-cell research avenues. availability and implementation: data and code are available on https://github.com/indukhatri/tcrformer.",AB_0544
"motivation in recent years, high-throughput sequencing technologies have made available the genome sequences of a huge variety of organisms. however, the functional annotation of the encoded proteins often still relies on low-throughput and costly experimental studies. bioinformatics approaches offer a promising alternative to accelerate this process. in this work, we focus on the binding of zinc(ii) ions, which is needed for 5%-10% of any organism's proteins to achieve their physiologically relevant form.results to implement a predictor of zinc(ii)-binding sites in the 3d structures of proteins, we used a neural network, followed by a filter of the network output against the local structure of all known sites. the latter was implemented as a function comparing the distance matrices of the c alpha and c beta atoms of the sites. we called the resulting tool master of metals (mom). the structural models for the entire proteome of an organism generated by alphafold can be used as input to our tool in order to achieve annotation at the whole organism level within a few hours. to demonstrate this, we applied mom to the yeast proteome, obtaining a precision of about 76%, based on data for homologous proteins.availability and implementation master of metals has been implemented in python and is available at https://github.com/cerm-cirmmp/master-of-metals. graphical abstract",AB_0544
"high-throughput clonal tracking in patients under hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy with integrating vector is instrumental in assessing bio-safety and efficacy. monitoring the fate of millions of transplanted clones and their progeny across differentiation and proliferation over time leverages the identification of the vector integration sites, used as surrogates of clonal identity. although gamma-tracking retroviral insertion sites (gamma-tris) is the state-of-the-art algorithm for clonal identification, the computational drawbacks in the tracking algorithm, based on a combinatorial all-versus-all strategy, limit its use in clinical studies with several thousands of samples per patient. we developed the first clonal tracking graph database, inclinigene (https://github.com/calabrialab/inclinigene), that imports the output files of gamma-tris and generates the graph of clones (nodes) connected by arches if two nodes share common genomic features as defined by the gamma-tris rules. embedding both clonal data and their connections in the graph, inclinigene can track all clones longitudinally over samples through data queries that fully explore the graph. this approach resulted in being highly accurate and scalable. we validated inclinigene using an in vitro dataset, specifically designed to mimic clinical cases, and tested the accuracy and precision. inclinigene allows extensive use of gamma-tris in large gene therapy clinical applications and naturally realizes the full data integration of molecular and genomics data, clinical and treatment measurements and genomic annotations. further extensions of inclinigene with data federation and with application programming interface will support data mining toward precision, personalized and predictive medicine in gene therapy.database url: https://github.com/calabrialab/inclinigene",AB_0544
