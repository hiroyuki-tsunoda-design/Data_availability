"pear is an important fruit tree that is widely distributed around the world. the first pear genome map was reported from our laboratory approximately 10 years ago. to further study global protein expression pat-terns in pear, we generated pear proteome data based on 24 major tissues. the tissue-resolved profiles provided evidence of the expression of 17 953 proteins. we identified 4294 new coding events and improved the pear genome annotation via the proteogenomic strategy based on 18 090 peptide spectra with peptide spectrum matches >1. among the eight randomly selected new short coding open reading frames that were expressed in the style, four promoted and one inhibited the growth of pear pollen tubes. based on gene coexpression module analysis, we explored the key genes associated with important agronomic traits, such as stone cell formation in fruits. the network regulating the synthesis of lignin, a major component of stone cells, was reconstructed, and receptor-like kinases were implicated as core factors in this regu-latory network. moreover, we constructed the online database pearexp (http://www.peardb.org.cn) to enable access to the pear proteogenomic resources. this study provides a paradigm for in-depth proteo-genomic studies of woody plants.",AB_0257
"a novel jso variant named apsm-jso is proposed in this study by making simple and effective modifications to improve its performance. there are three main differences between apsm-jso and jso. first, a novel adaptive selection mechanism (apsm) for selecting entries from the historical memory is designed to fully utilize the better entries in the historical memory. subsequently, the first in-first out (fifo) method is utilized to update the external archive for maintaining the population diversity and avoiding overuse of the external archive. finally, a new mutation strategy adopting rank-based selective pressure (rsp) is used to enhance the exploitation of apsm-jso. apsm-jso is evaluated using the ieee cec 2018 test suite in comparison with five state-of-the-art de-based variants (elshade-spacma, eb-lshade, lshade-rsp, ml-shade, and madde) and five winners of the ieee cec competitions (agsk, apgsk-imode, ebowithcmar, hses, and imode). the results demonstrate that apsm-jso outperforms jso and five de-based algorithms, is superior to four top winners of the ieee cec competitions (agsk, apgsk-imode, hses, and imode), and is not inferior to the top method of the ieee cec 2017 competition (ebowithcmar). the conclusion is that apsm-jso effectively further enhances the overall performance of jso, and is an excellent jso variant. the matlab source code of apsm-jso can bedownloaded from https://github.com/yintong-li/apsm-jso.",AB_0257
"recently, lysine lactylation (kla), a novel post-translational modification (ptm), which can be stimulated by lactate, has been found to regulate gene expression and life activities. therefore, it is imperative to accurately identify kla sites. currently, mass spectrometry is the fundamental method for identifying ptm sites. however, it is expensive and time-consuming to achieve this through experiments alone. herein, we proposed a novel computational model, auto-kla, to quickly and accurately predict kla sites in gastric cancer cells based on automated machine learning (automl). with stable and reliable performance, our model outperforms the recently published model in the 10-fold cross-validation. to investigate the generalizability and transferability of our approach, we evaluated the performance of our models trained on two other widely studied types of ptm, including phosphorylation sites in host cells infected with sars-cov-2 and lysine crotonylation sites in hela cells. the results show that our models achieve comparable or better performance than current outstanding models. we believe that this method will become a useful analytical tool for ptm prediction and provide a reference for the future development of related models. the web server and source code are available at http://tubic.org/kla and https://github.com/ tubic/auto-kla, respectively.",AB_0257
"knowledge graphs often suffer from incompleteness, and knowledge graph completion (kgc) aims at inferring the missing triplets through knowledge graph embedding from known factual triplets. however, most existing knowledge graph embedding methods only use the relational information of knowledge graph and treat the entities and relations as ids with simple embedding layer, ignoring the multi-modal information among triplets, such as text descriptions, images, etc. in this work, we propose a novel network to incorporate different modal information with graph structure information for more precise representation of multi-modal knowledge graph, termed as hyper-node relational graph attention (hrgat) network. in hrgat, we use low-rank multi-modal fusion to model the intra-modality and inter-modality dynamics, which transforms the original knowledge graph to a hyper-node graph. then, relational graph attention (rgat) network is used, which contains relation-specific attention and entity-relation fusion operation to capture the graph structure information. finally, we aggregate the updated multi-modal information and graph structure information to generate the final embeddings of knowledge graph to achieve kgc. by exploring multi-modal information and graph structure information, hrgat embraces faster convergence speed and achieves the state-of-the-art for kgc on the standard datasets. implementation code is available at https://github.com/broliang/hrgat.",AB_0257
"video frame interpolation (vfi) is of great importance for many video applications, yet it is still challenging even in the era of deep learning. some existing vfi models directly exploit existing lightweight network frameworks, thus making synthesized in-between frames blurry and creating artifacts due to imprecise motion representation. the other existing vfi models typically depend on heavy model architectures with a large number of parameters, preventing them from being deployed on small terminals. to address these issues, we propose a local lightweight vfi network ((lbec2)-b-2) that leverages bidirectional encoding structure with channel attention cascade. specifically, we improve visual quality by introducing a forward and backward encoding structure with channel attention cascade to better characterize motion information. furthermore, we introduce a local lightweight strategy into the state-of-the-art adaptive collaboration of flows (adacof) model to simplify its model parameters. compared with the original adacof model, the proposed (lbec2)-b-2 obtains performance gain at the cost of only one-third of the number of parameters and performs favorably against the state-of-the-art works on public datasets. our source code is available at https://github.com/pumpkin123709/lbec.git.",AB_0257
"the lesion recognition of dermoscopy images is significant for automated skin cancer diagnosis. most of the existing methods ignore the medical perspective, which is crucial since this task requires a large amount of medical knowledge. a few methods are designed according to medical knowledge, but they ignore to be fully in line with doctors' entire learning and diagnosis process, since certain strategies and steps of those are conducted in practice for doctors. thus, we put forward clinical-inspired network (ci-net) to involve the learning strategy and diagnosis process of doctors, as for a better analysis. the diagnostic process contains three main steps: the zoom step, the observe step and the compare step. to simulate these, we introduce three corresponding modules: a lesion area attention module, a feature extraction module and a lesion feature attention module. to simulate the distinguish strategy, which is commonly used by doctors, we introduce a distinguish module. we evaluate our proposed ci-net on six challenging datasets, including isic 2016, isic 2017, isic 2018, isic 2019, isic 2020 and ph2 datasets, and the results indicate that ci-net outperforms existing work. the code is publicly available at https://github.com/lzh19961031/dermoscopy_classification.",AB_0257
"this paper follows the idea of divide and conquer to propose a multi-exposure fusion network for the unsupervised generation of high dynamic range-like images. we develop a new intrinsic image decomposition (iid) network based on our modified iid model to produce the reflectance, shading, and color components from source images, which respectively represent the texture structure, lighting condition, and visible color distribution of the imaging scene. three fusion sub-networks are then designed to process these different components, producing pleasing images with rich structures, reasonable lighting, and suitable color. specif-ically, we first develop a reflectance fusion network to integrate the reflectance components, in which an adaptive pixel-scale selection strategy is adopted to dynamically guide the network to preserve rich scene textures. then, a shading fusion network with the adaptive global image-scale weighting strategy is designed to fulfill lighting adjustment, which can generate suitable illumination by defining the lighting adjustment as a game between the illumination of source images. finally, we propose a color fusion network that embeds both pixel-scale and image-scale strategies, which can guarantee a pleasing scene color distribution with a specifically designed color fidelity loss. extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods in terms of texture integration, illumination adjustment, and color fidelity. moreover, our method can be applied to fulfill tasks of the single low-light image enhancement and the single overexposed image correction with promising performance. the code is publicly available at https://github.com/haozhang1018/iid-mef.",AB_0257
"during breast cancer metastasis, the developmental process epithelial-mesenchymal (em) transition is abnormally activated. transcriptional regulatory networks controlling em transition are well-studied; however, alternative rna splicing also plays a critical regulatory role during this process. alternative splicing was proved to control the em transition process, and rna-binding proteins were determined to regulate alternative splicing. a comprehensive understanding of alternative splicing and the rna-binding proteins that regulate it during em transition and their dynamic impact on breast cancer remains largely unknown. to accurately study the dynamic regulatory relationships, time-series data of the em transition process are essential. however, only cross-sectional data of epithelial and mesenchymal specimens are available. therefore, we developed a pseudotemporal causality-based bayesian (pcb) approach to infer the dynamic regulatory relationships between alternative splicing events and rna-binding proteins. our study sheds light on facilitating the regulatory network-based approach to identify key rna-binding proteins or target alternative splicing events for the diagnosis or treatment of cancers. the data and code for pcb are available at: http://hkumath.hku.hk/*wkc/pcb(data+code).zip.",AB_0257
"photo composition is one of the most important factors in the aesthetics of photographs. as a popular application, composition recommendation for a photo focusing on a specific subject has been ignored by recent deep-learning-based composition recommendation approaches. in this paper, we propose a subject-aware image composition recommendation method, sac-net, which takes an rgb image and a binary subject window mask as input, and returns good compositions as crops containing the subject. our model first determines candidate scores for all possible coarse cropping windows. the crops with high candidate scores are selected and further refined by regressing their corner points to generate the output recommended cropping windows. the final scores of the refined crops are predicted by a final score regression module. unlike existing methods that need to preset several cropping windows, our network is able to automatically regress cropping windows with arbitrary aspect ratios and sizes. we propose novel stability losses for maximizing smoothness when changing cropping windows along with view changes. experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods not only on the subject-aware image composition recommendation task, but also for general purpose composition recommendation. we also have designed a multistage labeling scheme so that a large amount of ranked pairs can be produced economically. we use this scheme to propose the first subject-aware composition dataset sacd, which contains 2777 images, and more than 5 million composition ranked pairs. the sacd dataset is publicly available at https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/sacd/.",AB_0257
"previous video object segmentation approaches mainly focus on simplex solutions linking appearance and motion, limiting effective feature collaboration between these two cues. in this work, we study a novel and efficient full-duplex strategy network (fsnet) to address this issue, by considering a better mutual restraint scheme linking motion and appearance allowing exploitation of cross-modal features from the fusion and decoding stage. specifically, we introduce a relational cross-attention module (rcam) to achieve bidirectional message propagation across embedding sub-spaces. to improve the model's robustness and update inconsistent features from the spatiotemporal embeddings, we adopt a bidirectional purification module after the rcam. extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks show that our fsnet is robust to various challenging scenarios (e.g., motion blur and occlusion), and compares well to leading methods both for video object segmentation and video salient object detection. the project is publicly available at https://github.com/gewelsji/fsnet.",AB_0257
