"climate change is expected to intensify and increase extreme events in the weather cycle. since this has a significant impact on various sectors of our life, recent works are concerned with identifying and predicting such extreme events from earth observations. with respect to wildfire danger forecasting, previous deep learning approaches duplicate static variables along the time dimension and neglect the intrinsic differences between static and dynamic variables. furthermore, most existing multibranch architectures lose the interconnections between the branches during the feature learning stage. to address these issues, this article proposes a 2-d/3-d two-branch convolutional neural network (cnn) with a location-aware adaptive normalization (loan) layer. using loan as a building block, we can modulate the dynamic features conditional on their geographical locations. thus, our approach considers feature properties as a unified yet compound 2-d/3-d model. besides, we propose using the sinusoidal-based encoding of the day of the year to provide the model with explicit temporal information about the target day within the year. our experimental results show a better performance of our approach than other baselines on the challenging firecube dataset. the results show that location-aware adaptive feature normalization is a promising technique to learn the relation between dynamic variables and their geographic locations, which is highly relevant for areas where remote sensing data build the basis for analysis. the source code is available at https://github.com/hakamshams/loan.",AB_0503
"semantic segmentation is a fundamental and crucial task that is of great importance to real-world satellite image-based applications. yet a widely acknowledged issue that occurs when applying the semantic segmentation models to unseen scenery is that the model will perform much poorer than when it was applied to scenery similar to the training data. this phenomenon is usually termed as the domain shift problem. to tackle it, this article presents a self-training-based unsupervised domain adaptation (uda) method. different from the previous self-training approaches which focus on rectifying and improving the quality of the pseudo labels, we instead seek to exploit feature-level relation among neighboring pixels to structure and regularize the prediction of the adapted model. based on the assumption that spatial topological relation is maintained despite the impact of the domain shift, we propose a novel self-training mechanism to perform da by exploiting local relation in the feature space spanned by the teacher model, from which the pseudo labels are generated. quantitative experiments on four different public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform the other uda methods. besides, analytical experiments also intuitively verify the proposed assumption. codes will be publicly available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/pfst.",AB_0503
"we propose a tree-level biomass estimation model approximating allometric equations by lidar data. since tree crown diameter estimation is challenging from spaceborne lidar measurements, we develop a model to correlate tree height with biomass on the individual-tree levels employing a gaussian process regressor. in order to validate the proposed model, a set of 8342 samples on tree height, trunk diameter, and biomass has been assembled. it covers seven biomes globally present. we reference our model to four other models based on both, the jucker data and our own dataset. although our approach deviates from standard biomass-height-diameter models, we demonstrate the gaussian process regression model as a viable alternative. in addition, we decompose the uncertainty of tree biomass estimates into the modeland fitting-based contributions. we verify the gaussian process regressor has the capacity to reduce the fitting uncertainty down to below 5%. exploiting airborne lidar measurements and a field inventory survey on the ground, a stand-level (or plot-level) study confirms a low relative error of below 1% for our model. the data used in this study are available at https:// github.com/ zhuxlab/biomassuq.",AB_0503
"the objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the development of autonomous vehicle perception systems. so far, most autonomy perception research has been concentrated on improving perception systems' algorithmic quality or combining different sensor setups. in our work, we draw conclusions from participating in the indy autonomous challenge 2021 and its follow-up event in las vegas 2022. these were the first head-to-head autonomous racing competitions that required an entire perception pipeline to perceive the environment and the opposing surrounding vehicles. our research includes quantitative results from collected vehicle data and qualitative results from simulation, video, and multiple race analysis. the indy autonomous challenge was one of the few research projects that considered the entire autonomous vehicle. therefore, our findings indicate insights on the system level, including hardware setup and full-stack software. we can demonstrate that different sensor modalities in the vehicle have strengths and weaknesses when they are deployed. our results further show the difficulties and challenges that emerge when multi-modal perception systems must run in real-time on real-world autonomous vehicles. the most concise finding from our investigation is the summary of critical learnings when developing and deploying perception systems for autonomous systems. given the background of the study, it was inevitable that our conclusions were influenced by driving on the racetrack and only one hardware setup available. therefore, in the discussion, we draw further parallels to driving on public roads in dense traffic. more studies are needed to investigate the development and deployment of multi-modal perception systems for autonomous road vehicles with different hardware setups and various object detection, localization, and prediction algorithms. the novel contributions of this work are given by 12 lessons learned, summarized in 5 categories. these were derived and validated through a realized real-world application project. the videos of the final events in indianapolis and las vegas can be watched here:iac: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ertffn3ipis&ab_channel=cnethighlightsac@ces: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df9f4qfa0uu&ab_channel=cnethighlightsmultiple modules of the software stack are open source: https://github.com/tumftm.",AB_0503
"background: mental crises have high prevalences in adolescence. early interventions appear to be highly important to diminish the risk of the deterioration, recurrence, or chronification of symptoms. in recent years, various providers have started offering live chat support in psychological crises. the messenger-based psychological counseling service krisenchat aims to support young people in crises and, if necessary, provide a recommendation for a referral to the health care system or to seek further help from a trusted adult person.objective: this study aimed to investigate the impact of using the counseling service of krisenchat on the further help-seeking behavior of young people, and to identify associated factors of further help-seeking.methods: this longitudinal study analyzed anonymous data from 247 individuals who used krisenchat between october 2021 and march 2022, and received a recommendation for further help-seeking. an online survey directly after the chat assessed the perceived helpfulness of the chat and well-being after the chat. after 4 weeks, further help-seeking, facilitators and barriers to help-seeking, and self-efficacy were assessed in an online follow-up survey.results: the most frequently recommended services or persons to seek further help from included a psychotherapist or social psychiatric service (75/225, 33.3%), a school psychologist or school social worker (52/225, 23.1%), and the user's parents (45/225, 20.0%). of the 247 users, 120 (48.6%) indicated that they contacted the recommended service or person, and of these, 87 (72.5%) stated that they already had an appointment (or talk) with the respective service or person or that an appointment (or talk) was scheduled. the most frequently reported facilitators for further help-seeking were mental health literacy (54/120, 45.0%), improvement of self-efficacy (55/120, 45.8%), and symptom recognition (40/120, 33.3%). in users not displaying further help-seeking behavior, the most frequent barriers included stigmatization (60/127, 47.2%), lack of mental health literacy (59/127, 46.5%), need for self-reliance and autonomy (53/127, 41.7%), and negative family beliefs regarding help services (53/127, 41.7%). subgroup comparisons indicated significantly higher levels of self-efficacy in users displaying further help-seeking behavior than in those not displaying further help-seeking behavior. both subgroups did not differ in gender, age, recommended service or person, chat topics, perceived helpfulness, and well-being.conclusions: the findings of this study indicate that children and young adults receiving counseling on krisenchat benefit in terms of seeking further help. further help-seeking seems to be associated with higher levels of self-efficacy.trial registration: deutsches register klinischer studien drks00026671; https://tinyurl.com/4fm5xe68(jmir ment health 2023;10:e43780) doi: 10.2196/43780",AB_0503
"in recent years, convolutional neural networks (cnns) have drawn significant attention for the classification of hyperspectral images (hsis). due to their self-attention mechanism, the vision transformer (vit) provides promising classification performance compared to cnns. many researchers have incorporated vit for hsi classification purposes. however, its performance can be further improved because the current version does not use spatial-spectral features. in this article, we present a new morphological transformer (morphformer) that implements a learnable spectral and spatial morphological network, where spectral and spatial morphological convolution operations are used (in conjunction with the attention mechanism) to improve the interaction between the structural and shape information of the hsi token and the cls token. experiments conducted on widely used hsis demonstrate the superiority of the proposed morphformer over the classical cnn models and state-of-the-art transformer models. the source will be made available publicly at https://github.com/mhaut/morphformer.",AB_0503
"the ongoing industrial revolution termed industry 4.0 (i4.0) has borne witness to a series of profound changes towards increasing smart automation, particularly in the industrial sectors of automotive, aerospace, manufacturing, etc. automatic welding, a widely applied manufacturing process in these domains, is not an exception to these changes. one type of automatic welding, resistance spot welding (rsw), lies at the center of this work. large volumes and varieties of rsw data are being generated, thanks to the technologies behind i4.0. to address the associated data challenges, ontologies are essential in various aspects: integrating data sources, enhancing interoperability, and unifying knowledge etc. however, there have been limited studies around the semantic modelling of resistance spot welding: existing ontologies have overlooked some crucial concepts, such as an operation-centric view, welding software, and welding electrodes, which are essential for the monitoring of sensor measurements as well as the status of machine components (e.g., electrode wear). additionally, current ontologies are not publicly available (to the best of our knowledge), and therefore cannot be accessed by other users. such a lack of availability often requires that users build their ontologies from scratch. in this paper, we propose our rsw ontology (rswo) (rswo is publicly available at https://w3id.org/def/mo-rswo) to formalize knowledge in the rsw domain. it combines three sources of knowledge: extensive discussions with bosch welding experts; reusing terminologies following iso-14327 and iso-14373 standards; and existing established ontologies. we have evaluated rswo on real-world data from monitoring welding quality at bosch in germany, using competency questions, fair principles, oops!, and ontometrics.",AB_0503
"in systems biology, the analysis of complex nonlinear systems faces many methodological challenges. for the evaluation and comparison of the performances of novel and competing compu-tational methods, one major bottleneck is the availability of realistic test problems. we present an approach for performing realistic simulation studies for analyses of time course data as they are typi-cally measured in systems biology. since the design of experiments in practice depends on the process of interest, our approach considers the size and the dynamics of the mathematical model which is in-tended to be used for the simulation study. to this end, we used 19 published systems biology models with experimental data and evaluated the relationship between model features (e.g., the size and the dynamics) and features of the measurements such as the number and type of observed quantities, the number and the selection of measurement times, and the magnitude of measurement errors. based on these typical relationships, our novel approach enables suggestions of realistic simulation study designs in the systems biology context and the realistic generation of simulated data for any dynamic model. the approach is demonstrated on three models in detail and its performance is validated on nine models by comparing ode integration, parameter optimization, and parameter identifiability. the pre-sented approach enables more realistic and less biased benchmark studies and thereby constitutes an important tool for the development of novel methods for dynamic modeling.availability: the approach is implemented in the matlab-based modelling toolbox data2dynamics and available at https://github.com/data2dynamics/d2d.",AB_0503
"image registration is an essential task in image processing, where the final objective is to geometrically align two or more images. in remote sensing, this process allows comparing, fusing, or analyzing data, especially when multimodal images are used. in addition, multimodal image registration becomes fairly challenging when the images have a significant difference in scale and resolution, together with local small image deformations. for this purpose, this letter presents a novel optical flow (of)-based image registration network, named the flou-net, which tries to further exploit intersensor synergies by means of deep learning. the proposed method is able to extract spatial information from resolution differences and through a u-net backbone generate an of field estimation to accurately register small local deformations of multimodal images in a self-supervised fashion. for instance, the registration between sentinel-2 (s2) and sentinel-3 (s3) optical data is not trivial, as there are considerable spectral-spatial differences among their sensors. in this case, the higher spatial resolution of s2 results in s2 data being a convenient reference to spatially improve s3 products, as well as those of the forthcoming fluorescence explorer (flex) mission, since image registration is the initial requirement to obtain higher data processing level products. to validate our method, we compare the proposed flou-net with other state-of-the-art techniques using 21 coupled s2/s3 optical images from different locations of interest across europe. the comparison is performed through different performance measures. results show that the proposed flou-net can outperform the compared methods. the code and dataset are available in https://github.com/ibanezfd/flou-net.",AB_0503
"background: a growing body of evidence for digital interventions to improve sleep shows promising effects. the interventions investigated so far have been primarily web-based; however, app-based interventions may reach a wider audience and be more suitable for daily use.objective: this study aims to evaluate the intervention effects, adherence, and acceptance of an unguided app-based intervention for individuals who wish to improve their sleep.methods: in a randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effects of an app-based short intervention (refresh) to improve sleep compared with a waitlist condition. refresh is an 8-week unguided intervention covering the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (cbt-i) and including a sleep diary. the primary outcome was sleep quality (insomnia symptoms) as self-assessed by the regensburg insomnia scale (ris). the secondary outcomes were depression (9-item patient health questionnaire [phq-9] score) and perceived insomnia-related impairment.results: we included 371 participants, of which 245 reported poor sleep at baseline. about 1 in 3 participants who were allocated to the intervention group never accessed the intervention. active participants completed on average 4 out of 8 chapters. retention rates were 67.4% (n=250) at postassessment and 57.7% (n=214) at the 6-month follow-up. at postintervention, insomnia symptoms in the intervention group had improved more than those in the waitlist group, with a small effect (d=0.26) in the whole sample and a medium effect (d=0.45) in the subgroup with poor sleep. effects in the intervention group were maintained at follow-up. perceived insomnia-related impairment also improved from pre-to postassessment. no significant intervention effect on depression was detected. working alliance and acceptance were moderate to good. conclusions: an app-based, unguided intervention is a feasible and effective option to scale-up cbt-i-based treatment, but intervention uptake and adherence need to be carefully addressed.trial registration: isrctn registry isrctn53553517; https://www.isrctn.com/isrctn53553517",AB_0503
