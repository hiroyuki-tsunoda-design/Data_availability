"the proposal of perceptual loss solves the over-smoothing problem of images caused by pixel-wise loss and improves the visual quality of the images, but it also inevitably produces a large number of artifacts and distortions in images. the reason for this phenomenon is that the perceptual features only rely on a single pre-trained visual geometry group (vgg) network, which results in the features of the image being unable to be fully extracted, thus limiting the reasoning ability of the model. to fundamentally reduce the generation of artifacts and distortions, this paper pro-poses the dual perceptual loss (dp loss). first, we improve the perceptual feature extraction method so that it no longer only extracts single-type vgg features. in addition, a residual network (resnet) feature that has a complementary relationship with the vgg feature can also be extracted. then, we propose a dynamic weighting method to eliminate the magnitude difference between perceptual losses. finally, to obtain the excellent effect of image reconstruction, enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network (esrgan) with strong learning capability is used in this paper to adapt the complexity of dp loss. the abundant experimental studies and evaluations are conducted on benchmark datasets. results are encouraging and better than those previously reported on these datasets. the code is available at https://github.com/ sunny6-6-6/esrgan-dp.",AB_0252
"the existing 3d deep learning methods adopt either individual point-based features or localneighboring voxel-based features, and demonstrate great potential for processing 3d data. however, the point-based models are inefficient due to the unordered nature of point clouds and the voxelbased models suffer from large information loss. motivated by the success of recent point-voxel representation, such as pvcnn and drinet, we propose a new convolutional neural network, called multi point-voxel convolution (mpvconv), for deep learning on point clouds. integrating both the advantages of voxel and point-based methods, mpvconv can effectively increase the neighboring collection between point-based features and also promote independence among voxel-based features. extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as shapenet part, s3dis and kitti for various tasks show that mpvconv improves the accuracy of the backbone (pointnet) by up to 36%, and achieves higher accuracy than the voxel-based model with up to 34x speedups. in addition, mpvconv outperforms the state-of-the-art point-based models with up to 8x speedups. also, our mpvconv only needs 65% of the gpu memory required by the latest point-voxel-based model (drinet). the source code of our method is attached in https://github.com/nwuzhouwei/mpvconv.",AB_0252
"tomography has made a revolutionary impact on the physical, biological and medical sciences. the mathematical foundation of tomography is to reconstruct a three-dimensional (3d) object from a set of two-dimensional (2d) projections. as the number of projections that can be measured from a sample is usually limited by the tolerable radiation dose and/or the geometric constraint on the tilt range, a main challenge in tomography is to achieve the best possible 3d reconstruction from a limited number of projections with noise. over the years, a number of tomographic reconstruction methods have been developed including direct inversion, real-space, and fourier-based iterative algorithms. here, we report the development of a real-space iterative reconstruction (resire) algorithm for accurate tomographic reconstruction. resire iterates between the update of a reconstructed 3d object and the measured projections using a forward and back projection step. the forward projection step is implemented by the fourier slice theorem or the radon transform, and the back projection step by a linear transformation. our numerical and experimental results demonstrate that resire performs more accurate 3d reconstructions than other existing tomographic algorithms, when there are a limited number of projections with noise. furthermore, resire can be used to reconstruct the 3d structure of extended objects as demonstrated by the determination of the 3d atomic structure of an amorphous ta thin film. we expect that resire can be widely employed in the tomography applications in different fields. finally, to make the method accessible to the general user community, the matlab source code of resire and all the simulated and experimental data are available at https://zenodo.org/record/7273314.",AB_0252
"real-time and accurate detection of ships plays a vital role in ensuring navigation safety and ship supervision. aiming at the problems of large parameters, large computation quantity, poor real-time performance, and high requirements for memory and computing power of the current ship detection model, this paper proposes a ship target detection algorithm mc-yolov5s based on yolov5s. first, the mobilenetv3-small lightweight network is used to replace the original feature extraction backbone network of yolov5s to improve the detection speed of the algorithm. and then, a more efficient cneb is designed based on the convnext-block module of the convnext network to replace the original feature fusion module of yolov5s, which improves the spatial interaction ability of feature information and further reduces the complexity of the model. the experimental results obtained from the training and verification of the mc-yolov5s algorithm show that, compared with the original yolov5s algorithm, mc-yolov5s reduces the number of parameters by 6.98 mb and increases the map by about 3.4%. even compared with other lightweight detection models, the improved model proposed in this paper still has better detection performance. the mc-yolov5s has been verified in the ship visual inspection and has great application potential. the code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/sakura994479727/datas.",AB_0252
"rna alternative splicing, a post-transcriptional stage in eukaryotes, is crucial in cellular homeostasis and disease processes. due to the rapid development of the next-generation sequencing (ngs) technology and the flood of ngs data, the detection of differential splicing from rna-seq data has become mainstream. a range of bioinformatic tools has been developed. however, until now, an independent and comprehensive comparison of available algorithms/tools at the event level is still lacking. here, 21 different tools are subjected to systematic evaluation, based on simulated rna-seq data where exact differential splicing events are introduced. we observe immense discrepancies among these tools. suppa, darts, rmats and leafcutter outperforme other event-based tools. we also examine the abilities of the tools to identify novel splicing events, which shows that most event-based tools are unsuitable for discovering novel splice sites. to improve the overall performance, we present two methodological approaches i.e. low-expression transcript filtering and tool-pair combination. finally, a new protocol of selecting tools to perform differential splicing analysis for different analytical tasks (e.g. precision and recall rate) is proposed. under this protocol, we analyze the distinct splicing landscape in the dux4/igh subgroup of b-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and uncover the differential splicing of tcf12. all codes needed to reproduce the results are available at https://github.com/mhjiang97/benchmarking_ds.",AB_0252
"background: concentrations of the pathogenic microorganisms' dna in biological samples are typically low. therefore, dna diagnostics of common infections are costly, rarely accurate, and challenging. limited by failing to cover updated epidemic testing samples, computational services are difficult to implement in clinical applications without complex customized settings. furthermore, the combined biomarkers used to maintain high conservation may not be cost effective and could cause several experimental errors in many clinical settings. given the limitations of recent developed technology, 16s rrna is too conserved to distinguish closely related species, and mosaic plasmids are not effective as well because of their uneven distribution across prokaryotic taxa. results: here, we provide a computational strategy, shine, that allows extraction of specific, sensitive and well-conserved biomarkers from massive microbial genomic datasets. distinguished with simple concatenations with blast-based filtering, our method involves a de novo genome alignment-based pipeline to explore the original and specific repetitive biomarkers in the defined population. it can cover all members to detect newly discovered multicopy conserved species-specific or even subspeciesspecific target probes and primer sets. the method has been successfully applied to a number of clinical projects and has the overwhelming advantages of automated detection of all pathogenic microorganisms without the limitations of genome annotation and incompletely assembled motifs. using on our pipeline, users may select different configuration parameters depending on the purpose of the project for routine clinical detection practices on the website https://bioinfo.liferiver.com.cn with easy registration. conclusions: the proposed strategy is suitable for identifying shared phylogenetic markers while featuring low rates of false positive or false negative. this technology is suitable for the automatic design of minimal and efficient pcr primers and other types of detection probes.",AB_0252
"in the post-genome-wide association study era, multi-omics techniques have shown great power and poten-tial for candidate gene mining and functional genomics research. however, due to the lack of effective data integration and multi-omics analysis platforms, such techniques have not still been applied widely in rape-seed, an important oil crop worldwide. here, we report a rapeseed multi-omics database (bnir; http:// yanglab.hzau.edu.cn/bnir), which provides datasets of six omics including genomics, transcriptomics, variomics, epigenetics, phenomics, and metabolomics, as well as numerous variation-gene expression- phenotypeassociations by using multiple statistical methods. in addition, a series of multi-omics search and analysis tools are integrated to facilitate the browsing and application of these datasets. bnir is the most comprehensive multi-omics database for rapeseed so far, and two case studies demonstrated its power to mine candidate genes associated with specific traits and analyze their potential regulatory mechanisms.",AB_0252
"computational cell type identification is a fundamental step in single-cell omics data analysis. supervised celltyping methods have gained increasing popularity in single-cell rna-seq data because of the superior performance and the availability of high-quality reference datasets. recent technological advances in profiling chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution (scatac-seq) have brought new insights to the understanding of epigenetic heterogeneity. with continuous accumulation of scatac-seq datasets, supervised celltyping method specifically designed for scatac-seq is in urgent need. here we develop cellcano, a computational method based on a two-round supervised learning algorithm to identify cell types from scatac-seq data. the method alleviates the distributional shift between reference and target data and improves the prediction performance. after systematically benchmarking cellcano on 50 well-designed celltyping tasks from various datasets, we show that cellcano is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient. cellcano is well-documented and freely available at https://marvinquiet.github.io/cellcano/.",AB_0252
"motivation: reconstructing and analyzing all blood vessels throughout the brain is significant for understanding brain function, revealing the mechanisms of brain disease, and mapping the whole-brain vascular atlas. vessel segmentation is a fundamental step in reconstruction and analysis. the whole-brain optical microscopic imaging method enables the acquisition of whole-brain vessel images at the capillary resolution. due to the massive amount of data and the complex vascular features generated by high-resolution whole-brain imaging, achieving rapid and accurate segmentation of whole-brain vasculature becomes a challenge. results: we introduce hp-vsp, a high-performance vessel segmentation pipeline based on deep learning. the pipeline consists of three processes: data blocking, block prediction, and block fusion. we used parallel computing to parallelize this pipeline to improve the efficiency of whole-brain vessel segmentation. we also designed a lightweight deep neural network based on multi-resolution vessel feature extraction to segment vessels at different scales throughout the brain accurately. we validated our approach on whole-brain vascular data from three transgenic mice collected by hd-fmost. the results show that our proposed segmentation network achieves the state-of-the-art level under various evaluation metrics. in contrast, the parameters of the network are only 1% of those of similar networks. the established segmentation pipeline could be used on various computing platforms and complete the whole-brain vessel segmentation in 3 h. we also demonstrated that our pipeline could be applied to the vascular analysis. availability and implementation: the dataset is available at http://atlas.brainsmatics.org/a/li2301. the source code is freely available at https://github.com/visionlyx/hp-vsp.",AB_0252
