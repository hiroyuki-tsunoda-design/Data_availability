"the diagnosis of heart failure usually includes a global functional assessment, such as ejection fraction measured by magnetic resonance imaging. however, these metrics have low discriminate power to distinguish different cardiomyopathies, which may not affect the global function of the heart. quantifying local deforma-tions in the form of cardiac strain can provide helpful information, but it remains a challenge. in this work, we introduce warppinn, a physics-informed neural network to perform image registration to obtain local metrics of heart deformation. we apply this method to cine magnetic resonance images to estimate the motion during the cardiac cycle. we inform our neural network of the near-incompressibility of cardiac tissue by penalizing the jacobian of the deformation field. the loss function has two components: an intensity-based similarity term between the reference and the warped template images, and a regularizer that represents the hyperelastic behavior of the tissue. the architecture of the neural network allows us to easily compute the strain via automatic differentiation to assess cardiac activity. we use fourier feature mappings to overcome the spectral bias of neural networks, allowing us to capture discontinuities in the strain field. the algorithm is tested on synthetic examples and on a cine ssfp mri benchmark of 15 healthy volunteers, where it is trained to learn the deformation mapping of each case. we outperform current methodologies in landmark tracking and provide physiological strain estimations in the radial and circumferential directions. warppinn provides precise measurements of local cardiac deformations that can be used for a better diagnosis of heart failure and can be used for general image registration tasks. source code is available at https://github.com/fsahli/warppinn.",AB_0441
"the spatial organization of the tumor microenvironment has a profound impact on biology and therapy response. here, we perform an integrative single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analysis on hpv-negative oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc) to comprehensively characterize malignant cells in tumor core (tc) and leading edge (le) transcriptional architectures. we show that the tc and le are characterized by unique transcriptional profiles, neighboring cellular compositions, and ligand-receptor interactions. we demonstrate that the gene expression profile associated with the le is conserved across different cancers while the tc is tissue specific, highlighting common mechanisms underlying tumor progression and invasion. additionally, we find our le gene signature is associated with worse clinical outcomes while tc gene signature is associated with improved prognosis across multiple cancer types. finally, using an in silico modeling approach, we describe spatially-regulated patterns of cell development in oscc that are predictably associated with drug response. our work provides pan-cancer insights into tc and le biology and interactive spatial atlases (http://www.pboselab.ca/spatial_ oscc/; http://www.pboselab.ca/dynamo_oscc/) that can be foundational for developing novel targeted therapies.",AB_0441
"a long-standing goal in scene understanding is to obtain interpretable and editable representations that can be directly constructed from a raw monocular rgb-d video, without requiring specialized hardware setup or priors. the problem is significantly more challenging in the presence of multiple moving and/or deforming objects. traditional methods have approached the setup with a mix of simplifications, scene priors, pretrained templates, or known deformation models. the advent of neural representations, especially neural implicit representations and radiance fields, opens the possibility of end-to-end optimization to collectively capture geometry, appearance, and object motion. however, current approaches produce global scene encoding, assume multiview capture with limited or no motion in the scenes, and do not facilitate easy manipulation beyond novel view synthesis. in this work, we introduce a factored neural scene representation that can directly be learned from a monocular rgb-d video to produce object-level neural presentations with an explicit encoding of object movement (e.g., rigid trajectory) and/or deformations (e.g., nonrigid movement). we evaluate ours against a set of neural approaches on both synthetic and real data to demonstrate that the representation is efficient, interpretable, and editable (e.g., change object trajectory). code and data are available at: http://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/2023/factorednerf/.",AB_0441
"we present a database of observational constraints on past antarctic ice sheet changes during the last glacial cycle intended to consolidate the observations that represent our understanding of past antarctic changes and for state-space estimation and paleo-model calibrations. the database is a major expansion of the initial work of briggs and tarasov (2013). it includes new data types and multi-tier data quality assessment. the updated constraint database, antice2 (https://theghub.org/resources/4884, lecavalier et al., 2022), consists of observations of past grounded- and floating-ice-sheet extent, past ice thickness, past relative sea level, borehole temperature profiles, and present-day bedrock displacement rates. in addition to paleo-observations, the present-day ice sheet geometry and surface ice velocities are incorporated to constrain the present-day ice sheet configuration. the method by which the data are curated using explicitly defined criteria is detailed. moreover, the observational uncertainties are specified. the methodology by which the constraint database can be applied to evaluate a given ice sheet reconstruction is discussed. the implementation of the antice2 database for antarctic ice sheet model calibrations will improve antarctic ice sheet predictions during past warm and cold periods and yield more robust paleo-model spin ups for forecasting future ice sheet changes.",AB_0441
"while a large number of knowledge graphs have previously been developed by automatically extracting and structuring knowledge from literature, there is currently no such knowledge graph that encodes relationships between food, biochemicals and mental illnesses, even though a large amount of knowledge about these relationships is available in the form of unstructured text in biomedical literature articles. to address this limitation, this article describes the development of gena -(graph of mental-health and nutrition association), a knowledge graph that represents relations between nutrition and mental health, extracted from biomedical abstracts.gena is constructed from pubmed abstracts that contain keywords relating to chemicals, food, and health. a hybrid named entity recognition (ner) model is firstly applied to these abstracts to identify various entities of interest. subsequently, a deep syntax-based relation extraction model is used to detect binary relations between the identified entities. finally, the resulting relations are used to populate the gena knowledge graph, whose relationships can be accessed in an intuitive and interpretable manner using the neo4j database management system.to evaluate the reliability of gena, two annotators manually assessed a subset of the extracted relations. the evaluation results show that our methods obtain high precision for the ner task and acceptable precision and relative recall for the relation extraction task. gena consists of 43,367 relationships that encode information about nutrition and health, of which 94.04% are new relations that are not present in existing ontologies of food and diseases.gena is constructed based on scientific principles, and has the potential to be used within further applications to contribute towards scientific research within the domain. it is a pioneering knowledge graph in nutrition and mental health, containing a diverse range of relationship types. all of our source code and results are publicly available at https://github.com/ddlinh/gena-db.",AB_0441
"background: epinephrine is the most commonly used drug in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (ohca) resuscitation, but evidence supporting its efficacy is mixed. research question: what are the comparative efficacy and safety of standard dose epinephrine, high-dose epinephrine, epinephrine plus vasopressin, and placebo or no treatment in improving outcomes after ohca? study design and methods: in this systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, we searched six databases from inception through june 2022 for randomized controlled trials evaluating epinephrine use during ohca resuscitation. we performed frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis and present ors and 95% cis. we used the the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation approach to rate the certainty of evidence. outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation (rosc), survival to hospital admission, survival to discharge, and survival with good functional outcome. results: we included 18 trials (21,594 patients). compared with placebo or no treatment, high-dose epinephrine (or, 4.27; 95% ci, 3.68-4.97), standard-dose epinephrine (or, 3.69; 95% ci, 3.32-4.10), and epinephrine plus vasopressin (or, 3.54; 95% ci, 2.94-4.26) all increased rosc. high-dose epinephrine (or, 3.53; 95% ci, 2.97-4.20), standard-dose epinephrine (or, 3.00; 95% ci, 2.66-3.38), and epinephrine plus vasopressin (or, 2.79; 95% ci, 2.27-3.44) all increased survival to hospital admission as compared with placebo or no treatment. however, none of these agents may increase survival to discharge or survival with good functional outcome as compared with placebo or no treatment. compared with placebo or no treatment, standard-dose epinephrine improved survival to discharge among patients with nonshockable rhythm (or, 2.10; 95% ci, 1.21-3.63), but not in those with shockable rhythm (or, 0.85; 95% ci, 0.39-1.85). interpretation: use of standard-dose epinephrine, high-dose epinephrine, and epinephrine plus vasopressin increases rosc and survival to hospital admission, but may not improve survival to discharge or functional outcome. standard-dose epinephrine improved survival to discharge among patients with nonshockable rhythm, but not those with shockable rhythm. trial registry: center for open science: https://osf.io/arxwq",AB_0441
"background continuous glucose monitoring (cgm) provides the most objective method of assessing glucose in daily life. although there have been small, short-term physiologic studies of glucose metabolism in 'healthy' pregnant women a comprehensive, longitudinal description of changes in glucose over the course of pregnancy and how glucose dysregulation earlier in pregnancy relates to traditional third trimester screening for gestational diabetes, fetal growth and pregnancy outcomes is lacking. this study aims to characterise longitudinal changes in glycemia across gestation using cgm, in order to understand the evolution of dysglycemia and its relationship to fetal growth. method/design a multi-centre, prospective, observational, cohort study of 500 healthy pregnant women, recruited in the first trimester of pregnancy. masked cgm will be performed for a 14-day period on five occasions across pregnancy at 10-12, 18-20, 26-28, 34-36 weeks gestation and postnatally. routinely collected anthropometric and sociodemographic information will be recorded at each visit including: weight, height, blood pressure, current medication. age, parity, ethnicity, smoking will be recorded. blood samples will be taken at each visit for hba1c and a sample stored. details on fetal growth from ultrasound scans and the ogtt results will be recorded. maternal and neonatal outcomes will be collected. cgm glucose profiling is the exposure of interest, and will be performed using standard summary statistics, functional data analysis and glucotyping. the primary maternal outcome is clinical diagnosis of gdm. the primary neonatal outcome is large for gestational age (lga) (> 90th centile defined by customised birthweight centile). the relationship of glucose to key secondary maternal and neonatal outcomes will be explored. discussion this study will ascertain the relationship of maternal dysglycemia to fetal growth and outcomes. it will explore whether cgm glucose profiling can detect gdm before the ogtt; or indeed whether cgm glucose profiling may be more useful than the ogtt at detecting lga and other perinatal outcomes. trial registration isrctn 15,706,303 https://www.isrctn.com/isrctn15706303 registration date: 13th march 2023.",AB_0441
"point patterns are characterized by their density and correlation. while spatial variation of density is well-understood, analysis and synthesis of spatially-varying correlation is an open challenge. no tools are available to intuitively edit such point patterns, primarily due to the lack of a compact representation for spatially varying correlation. we propose a low-dimensional perceptual embedding for point correlations. this embedding can map point patterns to common three-channel raster images, enabling manipulation with off-the-shelf image editing software. to synthesize back point patterns, we propose a novel edge-aware objective that carefully handles sharp variations in density and correlation. the resulting framework allows intuitive and backward-compatible manipulation of point patterns, such as recoloring, relighting to even texture synthesis that have not been available to 2d point pattern design before. effectiveness of our approach is tested in several user experiments. code is available at https://github.com/xchhuang/patternshop.",AB_0441
"high conservation of the disease-associated genes between flies and humans facilitates the common use of drosophila mela-nogaster to study metabolic disorders under controlled laboratory conditions. however, metabolic modeling studies are highly lim-ited for this organism. we here report a comprehensively curated genome-scale metabolic network model of drosophila using an orthology-based approach. the gene coverage and metabolic in-formation of the draft model derived from a reference human model were expanded via drosophila-specific kegg and metacyc databases, with several curation steps to avoid metabolic redun-dancy and stoichiometric inconsistency. furthermore, we performed literature-based curations to improve gene-reaction associa-tions, subcellular metabolite locations, and various metabolic pathways. the performance of the resulting drosophila model (8,230 reactions, 6,990 metabolites, and 2,388 genes), idrosophila1 (https://github.com/sysbiogtu/idrosophila), was assessed using flux balance analysis in comparison with the other currently available fly models leading to superior or comparable results. we also evaluated the transcriptome-based prediction capacity of idrosophila1, where differential metabolic pathways during parkin-son's disease could be successfully elucidated. overall, idrosophila1 is promising to investigate system-level metabolic alterations in re-sponse to genetic and environmental perturbations.",AB_0441
"graph neural networks (gnns) have witnessed remarkable proliferation due to the increasing number of applications where data is represented as graphs. gnn-based multigraph population fusion methods for estimating population representative connectional brain templates (cbt) have recently led to improvements, especially in network neuroscience. however, prior studies do not consider how an individual training brain multigraph influences the quality of gnn training for brain multigraph population fusion. to address this issue, we propose two major sample selection methods to quantify the influence of a training brain multigraph on the brain multigraph population fusion task using gnns, in a fully unsupervised manner: (1) graphgradin, in which we use gradients w.r.t gnn weights to trace changes in the centeredness loss of connectional brain template during the training phase; (2) graphtestin, in which we exclude a training brain multigraph of interest during the refinement process in the test phase to infer its influence on the cbt centeredness loss. next, we select the most influential multigraphs to build the training set for brain multigraph population fusion into a cbt. we conducted extensive experiments on brain multigraph datasets to show that using a dataset of influential training samples improves the learned connectional brain template in terms of centeredness, discriminativeness, and topological soundness. finally, we demonstrate the use of our methods by discovering the connectional fingerprints of healthy and neurologically disordered brain multigraph populations including alzheimer's disease and autism spectrum disorder patients. our source code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/graphgradin.",AB_0441
