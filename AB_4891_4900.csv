"introduction: adopting an active lifestyle is an important goal, but can be difficult to achieve for people with depressive disorders. current guidelines recommend the integration of physical activity in the multimodal treatment of depressive disorders. however, the possibilities to provide individual support for physical activities are frequently limited. the aim of our study was to examine how physical activity can be increased in a real-world setting by combining physical training and psychological interventions. materials and methods: in this randomized-controlled interventional study, 31 outpatients diagnosed with moderate to severe depression were recruited from the region of hannover. the intervention group (n=16) was offered six weekly individual sessions lasting between 60 and 90 min with a sports scientist, including motivational interviewing and accompanied exercise activities. the control group (n=15) received a written booklet with information on steps toward becoming more active. moderateto-vigorous physical activity (mvpa) as the primary outcome was analyzed using activity sensors before and after the 6-week intervention, and 3 months subsequently. secondary outcomes included the six-minute walk test (6mwt), sit-to-stand test (sts), and mental health assessed with self-rating questionnaires. results: in the intervention group, mvpa increased significantly between baseline and the first follow-up and remained at an increased level at the second followup in comparison to decreased levels in the control group (difference of 15.5 min/day between groups over time, se=6.2 min/day, 95%-ci[2.7, 28.3], p=0.020). the increased activity level was associated with markers of increased fitness (6mwt and sts) in the intervention group. both groups showed comparable improvements in depressive symptoms, while the number of patients receiving antidepressants increased in the control group and decreased in the intervention group. two patients dropped out of the intervention group during the trial. conclusion: the intervention proved to be a feasible and effective aid to promote a physically active lifestyle for patients diagnosed with depression. furthermore, the higher level of physical activity was maintained for the follow-up period. given the success of the approach evaluated in this project, individual support for physical activity should be investigated in larger sample sizes and potentially be considered in the multimodal treatment of depression. clinical trial registration: [https://clinicaltrials.gov/], identifier [drks00023257].",AB_0490
"motivation: dna cpg methylation (cpgm) has proven to be a crucial epigenetic factor in the mammalian gene regulatory system. assessment of dna cpg methylation values via whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (wgbs) is, however, computationally extremely demanding. results: we present fast methylation calling (fame), the first approach to quantify cpgm values directly from bulk or single-cell wgbs reads without intermediate output files. fame is very fast but as accurate as standard methods, which first produce bs alignment files before computing cpgm values. we present experiments on bulk and single-cell bisulfite datasets in which we show that data analysis can be significantly sped-up and help addressing the current wgbs analysis bottleneck for large-scale datasets without compromising accuracy. availability and implementation: an implementation of fame is open source and licensed under gpl-3.0 at https://github.com/fischerjo/fame.",AB_0490
"conservation of gene neighbourhood over evolutionary distances is generally indicative of shared regu-lation or functional association among genes. this concept has been broadly exploited in prokaryotes but its use on eukaryotic genomes has been limited to specific functional classes, such as biosynthetic gene clusters. we here used an evolutionary-based gene cluster discovery algorithm (evolclust) to pre-compute evolutionarily conserved gene neighbourhoods, which can be searched, browsed and down-loaded in evolclustdb. we inferred & dblbond;35,000 cluster families in 882 different species in genome compar-isons of five taxonomically broad clades: fungi, plants, metazoans, insects and protists. evolclustdb allows browsing through the cluster families, as well as searching by protein, species, identifier or sequence. visualization allows inspecting gene order per species in a phylogenetic context, so that rele-vant evolutionary events such as gain, loss or transfer, can be inferred. evolclustdb is freely available, without registration, at http://evolclustdb.org/.& copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd.",AB_0490
"hyperspectral imaging (hsi) is a relatively new medical imaging modality that exploits an area of diagnostic potential formerly untouched. although exploratory translational and clinical studies exist, no surgical hsi datasets are openly accessible to the general scientific community. to address this bottleneck, this publication releases heiporspectral (https://www.heiporspectral.org; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7737674), the first annotated high-quality standardized surgical hsi dataset. it comprises 5,758 spectral images acquired with the tivita (r) tissue and annotated with 20 physiological porcine organs from 8 pigs per organ distributed over a total number of 11 pigs. each hsi image features a resolution of 480 x 640 pixels acquired over the 500-1000 nm wavelength range. the acquisition protocol has been designed such that the variability of organ spectra as a function of several parameters including the camera angle and the individual can be assessed. a comprehensive technical validation confirmed both the quality of the raw data and the annotations. we envision potential reuse within this dataset, but also its reuse as baseline data for future research questions outside this dataset.",AB_0490
"purpose - internal gearings are commonly used in transmissions due to their advantages like high-power density. to ensure high efficiency, load-carrying capacity and good noise behavior, a profound knowledge of the local gear mesh is essential. the tooth contact of internal gears relates to a convex and concave surface that form a conformal contact. this is in contrast to external gears, where two convex surfaces form a contraformal contact. this paper aims at a better understanding of conformal contacts under elastohydrodynamic lubrication (ehl) to improve the design of internal gearings. design/methodology/approach - an existing numerical ehl model is used for studying the characteristic properties of a hard conformal ehl line contact. a hard contraformal ehl line contact is studied as reference. non-newtonian fluid behavior and thermal effects are considered. by taking into account the local contact conformity and kinematics, the effects and relevance of the curvature of the lubricant gap and micro-slip are analyzed. in a parameter study, scale effects of the contact radii on film thickness, temperature rise and friction are examined. findings - the curvature of the lubricant gap and effects of micro-slip are small in hard conformal ehl line contacts. for high micro-slip, it can be neglected. hence, the modeling of conformal contacts using an equivalent geometry of the contact problem is reasonable. the parameter study shows beneficial tribological aspects of the conformal contact compared to the contraformal contact. higher film thickness and lower fluid coefficient of friction are observed for conformal contacts, which can be attributed to lower pressures for the case of the same external normal force, or to a higher contact temperature rise for the case of equivalent contact pressure. originality/value - despite its widespread existence, the local geometry and kinematics in hard conformal ehl line contacts like in internal gearings have been rarely studied. the findings help for a better understanding of local contact characteristics and its relevance. the quantified scale effects help to improve the efficiency and load-carrying capacity of machine elements with hard conformal ehl contacts, like internal gearings. peer review - the peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/ilt-12-2022-0366/",AB_0490
"development of applications related to closed-loop control requires either testing on the field or on a realistic simulator, with the latter being more convenient. to ease that need, this work introduces mvsim, a simulator for multiple vehicles or robots capable of running in real time dozens of agents in simple scenarios, or a handful of them in complex scenarios. mvsim employs realistic physicsgrounded friction models for tire-ground interaction, and aims at accurate and gpu-accelerated simulation of most common modern sensors employed in mobile robotics and autonomous vehicle research, such as depth and rgb cameras, or 2d and 3d lidar scanners. all depth-related sensors are able to accurately measure distances to 3d models provided by the user to define custom world elements. efficient simulation is achieved by means of focusing on ground vehicles, which allows the use of a simplified 2d physics engine for body collisions while solving wheel-ground interaction forces separately. the core parts of the system are written in c++ for maximum efficiency, while python, ros 1, and ros 2 wrappers are also offered. a custom publish/subscribe protocol based on zeromq (zmq) is defined to allow for multiprocess applications to access or modify a running simulation. this simulator enables and makes easier to do research and development on vehicular dynamics, autonomous navigation algorithms, and simultaneous localization and mapping (slam) methods. an experimental performance benchmarking is provided against other state-of-the-art simulators showing significant less cpu usage. the project source code is freely available online under the bsd 3-clause license in https://github.com/mrpt/mvsim. & copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0490
"motivation: long-read transcriptome sequencing (lrts) has the potential to enhance our understanding of alternative splicing and the complexity of this process requires the use of versatile computational tools, with the ability to accommodate various stages of the workflow with maximum flexibility.results: we introduce isotools, a python-based lrts analysis framework that offers a wide range of functionality for transcriptome reconstruction and quantification of transcripts. furthermore, we integrate a graph-based method for identifying alternative splicing events and a statistical approach based on the beta-binomial distribution for detecting differential events. to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, we applied isotools to pacbio lrts data of human hepatocytes treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid. our results indicate that lrts can provide valuable insights into alternative splicing, particularly in terms of complex and differential splicing patterns, in comparison to short-read rna-seq.availability and implementation: isotools is available on github and pypi, and its documentation, including tutorials, cli, and api references, can be found at .https://isotools.readthedocs.io/.",AB_0490
"electricity-based fuels from renewable energies are regarded as a key instrument for climate protection. these power-to-x (ptx) products are to replace fossil fuels in sectors where direct use of electricity from renewable energies is not possible. we investigate the production potential of electricity-based fuels from onshore wind energy and ground-mounted photovoltaic energy for all countries outside the european economic area along 14 ptx production pathways. these include hydrogen (gaseous and liquid), methane (gaseous and liquid), methanol, fischer-tropsch fuels and ammonia each with two different electrolysis technologies. the technical and eco-nomic potential assessment is based on data with hourly temporal and high spatial resolution. the analysis considers various criteria, including prevailing weather conditions, sustainability as well as nature conservation concerns and land use. the results show the production quantities and costs of climate-friendly fuel production under strict sustainability criteria and locate them spatially. it is shown that many regions of the world are well suited to produce ptx products. the production quantity outside europe is up to 120,000 twhlhv/yr of hydrogen or 87,000 twhlhv/yr of electricity-based liquid fuels in the long term. we identify 97 countries with potentials, of which 38 countries possess relevant potentials of more than 100 twhlhv/yr. the largest suitable areas are in the united states, australia and argentina. the production costs vary a lot across the different regions. the lowest production costs for ptx generation are in latin america (chile, argentina, and venezuela) and mauritania with a lower limit of 42.3 euro/mwhlhv to 46.5 euro/mwhlhv for gaseous hydrogen and 84 euro/mwhlhv to 89.1 euro/mwhlhv for fischer-tropsch fuels. all best sites are pure wind or combined wind and photovoltaic sites. moreover, we show import options of these ptx products to europe considering socioeconomic factors and different transport options. all investigation results are freely accessible via the global ptx atlas on https://maps .iee.fraunhofer.de/ptx-atlas/.",AB_0490
"lung cancer is a serious disease responsible for millions of deaths every year. early stages of lung cancer can be manifested in pulmonary lung nodules. to assist radiologists in reducing the number of overseen nodules and to increase the detection accuracy in general, automatic detection algorithms have been proposed. particularly, deep learning methods are promising. however, obtaining clinically relevant results remains challenging. while a variety of approaches have been proposed for general purpose object detection, these are typically evaluated on benchmark data sets. achieving competitive performance for specific real-world problems like lung nodule detection typically requires careful analysis of the problem at hand and the selection and tuning of suitable deep learning models. we present a systematic comparison of state-of-the-art object detection algorithms for the task of lung nodule detection. in this regard, we address the critical aspect of class imbalance and and demonstrate a data augmentation approach as well as transfer learning to boost performance. we illustrate how this analysis and a combination of multiple architectures results in state-of-the-art performance for lung nodule detection, which is demonstrated by the proposed model winning the detection track of the node21 competition. the code for our approach is available at https://github. com/finnbehrendt/node21-.submit.",AB_0490
"aims/hypothesis there are two prerequisites for the precision medicine approach to be beneficial for treated individuals. first, there must be treatment heterogeneity; second, in the case of treatment heterogeneity, we need to detect clinical predictors to identify people who would benefit from one treatment more than from others. there is an established meta-regression approach to assess these two prerequisites that relies on measuring the variability of a clinical outcome after treatment in placebo-controlled randomised trials. our aim was to apply this approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes. methods we performed a meta-regression analysis using information from 174 placebo-controlled randomised trials with 178 placebo and 272 verum (i.e. active treatment) arms including 86,940 participants with respect to the variability of glycaemic control as assessed by hba(1c) after treatment and its potential predictors. results the adjusted difference in log(sd) values between the verum and placebo arms was 0.037 (95% ci: 0.004, 0.069). that is, we found a small increase in the variability of hba(1c) values after treatment in the verum arms. in addition, one potentially relevant predictor for explaining this increase, drug class, was observed, and glp-1 receptor agonists yielded the largest differences in log(sd) values. conclusions/interpretation the potential of the precision medicine approach in the treatment of type 2 diabetes is modest at best, at least with regard to an improvement in glycaemic control. our finding of a larger variability after treatment with glp-1 receptor agonists in individuals with poor glycaemic control should be replicated and/or validated with other clinical outcomes and with different study designs. data availability two datasets (one for the log[sd] and one for the baseline-corrected log[sd]) to reproduce the analyses from this paper are available on https://zenodo.org/record/7956635.",AB_0490
