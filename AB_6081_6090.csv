"major advances have been made in the field of precision medicine for treating cancer. however, many open questions remain that need to be answered to realize the goal of matching every patient with cancer to the most efficacious therapy. to facilitate these efforts, we have developed cellminercdb: national center for advancing translational sciences (ncats; https://discover.nci. nih.gov/rsconnect/cellminercdb_ncats/), which makes available activity information for 2,675 drugs and compounds, including multiple nononcology drugs and 1,866 drugs and compounds unique to the ncats. cellminercdb: ncats comprises 183 cancer cell lines, with 72 unique to ncats, including some from previously understudied tissues of origin. multiple forms of data from different institutes are integrated, including single and com-bination drug activity, dna copy number, methylation and muta-tion, transcriptome, protein levels, histone acetylation and methylation, metabolites, crispr, and miscellaneous signatures. curation of cell lines and drug names enables cross-database (cdb) analyses. comparison of the datasets is made possible by the overlap between cell lines and drugs across databases. multiple univariate and multivariate analysis tools are built-in, including linear regres- sion and lasso. examples have been presented here for the clinical topoisomerase i (top1) inhibitors topotecan and irinotecan/sn- 38. this web application provides both substantial new data and significant pharmacogenomic integration, allowing exploration of",AB_0609
"nasa will launch the nancy grace roman space telescope (hereafter roman ) in the second half of this decade, which will allow for a generation-defining measurement of dark energy through multiple probes, including type ia supernovae (sne ia). to improve decisions on survey strategy, we have created the first simulations of realistic roman images that include artificial sne ia injected as point sources in the images. our analysis combines work done on roman simulations for weak gravitational lensing studies as well as catalogue-level simulations of sn ia samples. we have created a time series of images over 2 yr containing similar to 1050 sne ia, covering a 1 deg(2) subarea of a planned 5 deg2 deep survey. we have released these images publicly for community use along with input catalogues of all injected sources. we create secondary products from these images by generating coadded images and demonstrating recovery of transient sources using image subtraction. we perform first-use analyses on these images in order to measure galaxy detection efficiency, point source detection efficiency, and host-galaxy association biases. the simulated images can be found here at https://roman.ipac.caltech.edu/sims/sn survey image sim.html.",AB_0609
"t-cell-based immunotherapies hold tremendous potential in the fight against cancer, thanks to their capacity to specifically targeting diseased cells. nevertheless, this potential has been tempered with safety concerns regarding the possible recognition of unknown off-targets displayed by healthy cells. in a notorious example, engineered t-cells specific to magea3 (evdpighly) also recognized a titin-derived peptide (esdpivaqy) expressed by cardiac cells, inducing lethal damage in melanoma patients. such off-target toxicity has been related to t-cell cross-reactivity induced by molecular mimicry. in this context, there is growing interest in developing the means to avoid off-target toxicity, and to provide safer immunotherapy products. to this end, we present crossdome, a multi-omics suite to predict the off-target toxicity risk of t-cell-based immunotherapies. our suite provides two alternative protocols, i) a peptide centered prediction, or ii) a tcr-centered prediction. as proof-of-principle, we evaluate our approach using 16 well-known cross-reactivity cases involving cancer-associated antigens. with crossdome, the titin-derived peptide was predicted at the 99+ percentile rank among 36,000 scored candidates (p-value < 0.001). in addition, off-targets for all the 16 known cases were predicted within the top ranges of relatedness score on a monte carlo simulation with over 5 million putative peptide pairs, allowing us to determine a cut-off p-value for off target toxicity risk. we also implemented a penalty system based on tcr hotspots, named contact map (cm). this tcr-centered approach improved upon the peptide-centered prediction on the magea3-titin screening (e.g., from 27th to 6th, out of 36,000 ranked peptides). next, we used an extended dataset of experimentally-determined cross-reactive peptides to evaluate alternative crossdome protocols. the level of enrichment of validated cases among top 50 best-scored peptides was 63% for the peptide-centered protocol, and up to 82% for the tcr-centered protocol. finally, we performed functional characterization of top ranking candidates, by integrating expression data, hla binding, and immunogenicity predictions. crossdome was designed as an r package for easy integration with antigen discovery pipelines, and an interactive web interface for users without coding experience. crossdome is under active development, and it is available at https://github.com/antuneslab/crossdome.",AB_0609
"recently a biochemistry experiment named methyl-3c was developed to simultaneously capture the chromosomal conformations and dna methylation levels on individual single cells. however, the number of data sets generated from this experiment is still small in the scientific community compared with the greater amount of single-cell hi-c data generated from separate single cells. therefore, a computational tool to predict single-cell methylation levels based on single-cell hi-c data on the same individual cells is needed. we developed a graph transformer named schime to accurately predict the base-pair-specific (bp-specific) methylation levels based on both single-cell hi-c data and dna nucleotide sequences. we benchmarked schime for predicting the bp-specific methylation levels on all of the promoters of the human genome, all of the promoter regions together with the corresponding first exon and intron regions, and random regions on the whole genome. our evaluation showed a high consistency between the predicted and methyl-3c-detected methylation levels. moreover, the predicted dna methylation levels resulted in accurate classifications of cells into different cell types, which indicated that our algorithm successfully captured the cell-to-cell variability in the single-cell hi-c data. schime is freely available at http://dna.cs.miami.edu/schime/.",AB_0609
"learning enabled components are frequently used by autonomous systems and it is common for deep neural networks to be integrated in such systems for their ability to learn complex, non-linear data pat-terns and make accurate predictions in dynamic environments. however, their large number of parame-ters and their use as black boxes introduce risks as the confidence in each prediction is unknown and out-put values like softmax scores are not usually well-calibrated. different frameworks have been proposed to compute accurate confidence measures along with the predictions but at the same time introduce a number of limitations like execution time overhead or inability to be used with high-dimensional data. in this paper, we use the inductive venn predictors framework for computing probability intervals regarding the correctness of each prediction in real-time. we propose taxonomies based on distance metric learning to compute informative probability intervals in applications involving high-dimensional inputs. by assign-ing pseudo-labels to unlabeled input data during system deployment we further improve the efficiency of the computed probability intervals. empirical evaluation on image classification and botnet attacks de-tection in internet-of-things (iot) applications demonstrates improved accuracy and calibration. the pro-posed method is computationally efficient, and therefore, can be used in real-time. the code is available at https://github.com/dboursinos/efficient-probability-intervals-classification-inductive-venn-predictors .& copy; 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0609
"introduction: the implementation of small-molecule and immunotherapies in acute myeloid leukemia (aml) has been challenging due to genetic and epigenetic variability amongst patients. there are many potential mechanisms by which immune cells could influence small-molecule or immunotherapy responses, yet, this area remains understudied. methods: here we performed cell type enrichment analysis from over 560 aml patient bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from the beat aml dataset to describe the functional immune landscape of aml. results: we identify multiple cell types that significantly correlate with aml clinical and genetic features, and we also observe significant correlations of immune cell proportions with ex vivo small-molecule and immunotherapy responses. additionally, we generated a signature of terminally exhausted t cells (tex) and identified aml with high monocytic proportions as strongly correlating with increased proportions of these immunosuppressive t cells. discussion: our work, which is accessible through a new cell type module in our visualization platform (vizome; http://vizome.org/), can be leveraged to investigate potential contributions of different immune cells on many facets of the biology of aml.",AB_0609
"background: one benefit of pragmatic clinical trials is reduction of the burden on patients and clinical staff while facilitating a learning healthcare system. one way to decrease the work of clinical staff is through decentralized telephone consent.methods: the diuretic comparison project (dcp) was a nationwide point of care pragmatic clinical trial con-ducted by the va cooperative studies program. the purpose of the trial was to compare the clinical effectiveness on major cv outcomes of two commonly used diuretics, hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone, in an elderly patient population. telephone consent was allowed for this study because of its minimal risk designation. telephone consent was more difficult than initially anticipated and the study team constantly adjusted methods to find timely solutions.results: the major challenges can be categorized as call center-related, telecommunications, operational, and study population based. in particular, the possible technical and operational pitfalls are rarely discussed. by presenting hurdles here, future studies may avoid these challenges and start studies with a more effective system in place.conclusions: dcp is a novel study designed to answer an important clinical question. the lessons learned from implementing a centralized call center for the diuretic comparison project helped the study reach enrollment goals and develop a centralized telephone consent system that can be utilized for future pragmatic and explanatory clinical trials.clinical trial registration: the study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov; nct02185417 [https://clinicaltrials.gov/c t2/show/nct02185417].the contents do not represent the views of the u.s. department of veterans affairs or the united states government.",AB_0609
"motivation: elimination of cancer cells by t cells is a critical mechanism of anti-tumor immunity and cancer immunotherapy response. t cells recognize cancer cells by engagement of t cell receptors with peptide epitopes presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules on the cancer cell surface. peptide epitopes can be derived from antigen proteins coded for by multiple genomic sources. bioinformatics tools used to identify tumor-specific epitopes via analysis of dna and rna-sequencing data have largely focused on epitopes derived from somatic variants, though a smaller number have evaluated potential antigens from other genomic sources. results: we report here an open-source workflow utilizing the nextflow dsl2 workflow manager, landscape of effective neoantigens software (lens), which predicts tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens from single nucleotide variants, insertions and deletions, fusion events, splice variants, cancer-testis antigens, overexpressed self-antigens, viruses, and endogenous retroviruses. the primary advantage of lens is that it expands the breadth of genomic sources of discoverable tumor antigens using genomics data. other advantages include modularity, extensibility, ease of use, and harmonization of relative expression level and immunogenicity prediction across multiple genomic sources. we present an analysis of 115 acute myeloid leukemia samples to demonstrate the utility of lens. we expect lens will be a valuable platform and resource for t cell epitope discovery bioinformatics, especially in cancers with few somatic variants where tumor-specific epitopes from alternative genomic sources are an elevated priority. availability and implementation: more information about lens, including code, workflow documentation, and instructions, can be found at (https://gitlab.com/landscape-of-effective-neoantigens-software).",AB_0609
"the identification of splice site, or segments of an rna gene where noncoding and coding sequences are connected in the 5 & prime; and 3 & prime; directions, is an essential post-transcriptional step for the annotation of func-tional genes and is required for the study and analysis of biological function in eukaryotic organisms through protein production and gene expression. splice site detection tools have been proposed for this purpose; however, the models of these tools have a specific use case and are inefficiently or typically un-transferable between organisms. here, we present cnnsplice, a set of deep convolutional neural network models for splice site prediction. using the five-fold cross-validation model selection technique, we explore several models based on typical machine learning applications and propose five high-performing models to efficiently predict the true and false ss in balanced and imbalanced datasets. our evaluation results indicate that cnnsplice's models achieve a better performance compared with existing methods across five or-ganisms' datasets. in addition, our generality test shows cnnsplice's model ability to predict and annotate splice sites in new or poorly trained genome datasets indicating a broad application spectrum. cnnsplice demonstrates improved model prediction, interpretability, and generalizability on genomic datasets com-pared to existing splice site prediction tools. we have developed a web server for the cnnsplice algorithm which can be publicly accessed here: http://www.cnnsplice.online & copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of research network of computational and structural biotechnology. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0609
"adjustment for prognostic covariates increases the statistical power of randomized trials. the factors influencing the increase of power are well-known for trials with continuous outcomes. here, we study which factors influence power and sample size requirements in time-to-event trials. we consider both parametric simulations and simulations derived from the cancer genome atlas (tcga) cohort of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) patients to assess how sample size requirements are reduced with covariate adjustment. simulations demonstrate that the benefit of covariate adjustment increases with the prognostic performance of the adjustment covariate (c-index) and with the cumulative incidence of the event in the trial. for a covariate that has an intermediate prognostic performance (c-index=0.65), the reduction of sample size varies from 3.1% when cumulative incidence is of 10% to 29.1% when the cumulative incidence is of 90%. broadening eligibility criteria usually reduces statistical power while our simulations show that it can be maintained with adequate covariate adjustment. in a simulation of adjuvant trials in hcc, we find that the number of patients screened for eligibility can be divided by 2.4 when broadening eligibility criteria. last, we find that the cox-snell r-cs(2) is a conservative estimation of the reduction in sample size requirements provided by covariate adjustment. overall, more systematic adjustment for prognostic covariates leads to more efficient and inclusive clinical trials especially when cumulative incidence is large as in metastatic and advanced cancers. code and results are available at https://github.com/owkin/covadjustsim .",AB_0609
