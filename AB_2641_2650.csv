"one-shot semantic segmentation aims at distinguishing pixels of an unseen category from the background, using merely one annotated image from the same category. however, most previous works neglect the feature diversity of foreground and the context information of background by using the masked average pooling. to solve these issues, we propose the hierarchical context-agnostic network (hcnet). it mainly includes two modules: (1) a hierarchical pyramid supportive (hps) module that generate the hierarchical supportive prototypes from coarse to fine to ensure feature diversity, and (2) a background exclusion supportive (bes) module that explicitly introduces the contrastive information from the background for more precise category features. we conduct extensive experiments on pascal-5(i) and coco-20(i) to evaluate the performance of hcnet. hcnet achieves the miou score of 62.1% on pascal-5(i) and 40.7% on coco-20(i). and outperforms other works for the challenging one-shot segmentation, which has proved the efficiency of the whole network. code is available at https://github.com/fangzy97/hcnet.",AB_0265
"the host-guest incompatibility between a production host and non-native enzymes has posed an arduous challenge for synthetic biology, particularly between mesophile-derived enzymes and a thermophilic chassis. in the present study, we develop a thermophilic enzyme mining strategy comprising an automated co-evolution-based screening pipeline (http://cem.sjtu.edu.cn), computation-based enzyme characterization, and gene synthesis-based function validation. using glucos-amine-6-phosphate acetyltransferase (gna1) as an example, we successfully mined four novel gna1s with excellent thermostabilities and catalytic performances. calculation and analysis based on alphafold2-generated structures were also conducted to uncover the mechanism underlying their excellent properties. finally, our mined gna1s were used to enable the high-temperature n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) production with high titers of up to 119.3 g/l, with the aid of systems metabolic engineering and temperature programming. this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the enzyme mining strategy, highlighting the application prospects of mining new enzymes from massive databases and providing an effective solution for tackling host-guest incompatibility.",AB_0265
"trans-splicing of a spliced leader (sl) to the 5' ends of mrnas is used to produce mature mrnas in several phyla of great importance to human health and the marine ecosystem. one of the consequences of the addition of sl sequences is the change or disruption of the open reading frames (orfs) in the recipient transcripts. given that most sl sequences have one or more of the trinucleotide nug, including aug in flatworms, trans-splicing of sl sequences can potentially supply a start codon to create new orfs, which we refer to as slorfs, in the recipient mrnas. due to the lack of a tool to precisely detect them, slorfs were usually neglected in previous studies. in this work, we present the tool slorffinder, which automatically links the sl sequences to the recipient mrnas at the trans splicing sites identified from sl-containing reads of rna-seq and predicts slorfs according to the distribution of ribosome-protected footprints (rpfs) on the trans-spliced transcripts. by applying this tool to the analyses of nematodes, ascidians and euglena, whose rpfs are publicly available, we find wide existence of slorfs in these taxa. furthermore, we find that slorfs are generally translated at higher levels than the annotated orfs in the genomes, suggesting they might have important functions. overall, this study provides a tool, slorffinder (https://github.com/songbo446/slorffinder), to identify slorfs, which can enhance our understanding of orfs in taxa with sl machinery.",AB_0265
"although previous studies have revealed that synonymous mutations contribute to various human diseases, distinguishing deleterious synonymous mutations from benign ones is still a challenge in medical genomics. recently, computational tools have been introduced to predict the harmfulness of synonymous mutations. however, most of these computational tools rely on balanced training sets without considering abundant negative samples that could result in deficient performance. in this study, we propose a computational model that uses a selective ensemble to predict deleterious synonymous mutations (sedsm). we construct several candidate base classifiers for the ensemble using balanced training subsets randomly sampled from the imbalanced benchmark training sets. the diversity measures of the base classifiers are calculated by the pairwise diversity metrics, and the classifiers with the highest diversities are selected for integration using soft voting for synonymous mutation prediction. we also design two strategies for filling in missing values in the imbalanced dataset and constructing models using different pairwise diversity metrics. the experimental results show that a selective ensemble based on double fault with the ensemble strategy eknni for filling in missing values is the most effective scheme. finally, using 40-dimensional biology features, we propose a novel model based on a selective ensemble for predicting deleterious synonymous mutations (sedsm). sedsm outperformed other state-of-the-art methods on the independent test sets according to multiple evaluation indicators, indicating that it has an outstanding predictive performance for deleterious synonymous mutations. we hope that sedsm will be useful for studying deleterious synonymous mutations and advancing our understanding of synonymous mutations. the source code of sedsm is freely accessible at https://github.com/xialab-ahu/sedsm.git.",AB_0265
"motivation: spatially resolved gene expression profiles are the key to exploring the cell type spatial distributions and understanding the architecture of tissues. many spatially resolved transcriptomics (srt) techniques do not provide single-cell resolutions, but they measure gene expression profiles on captured locations (spots) instead, which are mixtures of potentially heterogeneous cell types. currently, several cell-type deconvolution methods have been proposed to deconvolute srt data. due to the different model strategies of these methods, their deconvolution results also vary. results: leveraging the strengths of multiple deconvolution methods, we introduce a new weighted ensemble learning deconvolution method, endecon, to predict cell-type compositions on srt data in this work. endecon integrates multiple base deconvolution results using a weighted optimization model to generate a more accurate result. simulation studies demonstrate that endecon outperforms the competing methods and the learned weights assigned to base deconvolution methods have high positive correlations with the performances of these base methods. applied to real datasets from different spatial techniques, endecon identifies multiple cell types on spots, localizes these cell types to specific spatial regions and distinguishes distinct spatial colocalization and enrichment patterns, providing valuable insights into spatial heterogeneity and regionalization of tissues. availability and implementation : the source code is available at https://github.com/zhangxf-ccnu/endecon. contact: zhangxf@ccnu.edu.cn supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0265
"crop type mapping is an indispensable topic in the agricultural field and plays an important role in agricultural intelligence. in crop type mapping, most studies focus on time series models. however, in our experimental area, the images of the crop harvest stage can be obtained from single temporal remote sensing images. only using single temporal data for crop type mapping can reduce the difficulty of dataset production. in addition, the model of single temporal crop type mapping can also extract the spatial features of crops more effectively. in this work, we linked crop type mapping with 2d semantic segmentation and designed cacpu-net based on single-source and single-temporal autumn sentinel-2 satellite images. first, we used a shallow convolutional neural network, u-net, and introduced channel attention mechanism to improve the model's ability to extract spectral features. second, we presented the dice to compute loss together with cross-entropy to mitigate the effects of crop class imbalance. in addition, we designed the cp module to additionally focus on hard-to-classify pixels. our experiment was conducted on beidahuang youyi of heilongjiang province, which mainly grows rice, corn, soybean, and other economic crops. on the dataset we collected, through the 10-fold cross-validation experiment under the 8:1:1 dataset splitting scheme, our method achieved 93.74% overall accuracy, higher than state-of-the-art models. compared with the previous model, our improved model has higher classification accuracy on the parcel boundary. this study provides an effective end-to-end method and a new research idea for crop type mapping. the code and the trained model are available on https://github.com/mooneed/cacpu-net.",AB_0265
"recent innovations in single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (sccas) have revolutionized the characterization of epigenomic heterogeneity. estimation of the number of cell types is a crucial step for downstream analyses and biological implications. however, efforts to perform estimation specifically for sccas data are limited. here, we propose aster, an ensemble learning-based tool for accurately estimating the number of cell types in sccas data. aster outperformed baseline methods in systematic evaluation on 27 datasets of various protocols, sizes, numbers of cell types, degrees of cell-type imbalance, cell states and qualities, providing valuable guidance for sccas data analysis. availability and implementation: aster along with detailed documentation is freely accessible at https://aster.readthedocs.io/ under the mit license. it can be seamlessly integrated into existing sccas analysis workflows. the source code is available at https://github.com/biox-nku/aster. contact: chenshengquan@nankai.edu.cn or ruijiang@tsinghua.edu.cn supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0265
"motivation: rna viruses tend to mutate constantly. while many of the variants are neutral, some can lead to higher transmissibility or virulence. accurate assembly of complete viral genomes enables the identification of underlying variants, which are essential for studying virus evolution and elucidating the relationship between genotypes and virus properties. recently, third-generation sequencing platforms such as nanopore sequencers have been used for real-time virus sequencing for ebola, zika, coronavirus disease 2019, etc. however, their high per-base error rate prevents the accurate reconstruction of the viral genome. results: in this work, we introduce a new tool, accuvir, for viral genome assembly and polishing using error-prone long reads. it can better distinguish sequencing errors from true variants based on the key observation that sequencing errors can disrupt the gene structures of viruses, which usually have a high density of coding regions. our experimental results on both simulated and real third-generation sequencing data demonstrated its superior performance on generating more accurate viral genomes than generic assembly or polish tools. availability and implementation: the source code and the documentation of accuvir are available at https://github.com/rainyrubyzhou/accuvir. contact: yannisun@cityu.edu.hk supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0265
"drug-target interaction (dti) prediction is an essential step in drug repositioning. a few graph neural network (gnn)-based methods have been proposed for dti prediction using heterogeneous biological data. however, existing gnn-based methods only aggregate information from directly connected nodes restricted in a drug -related or a target -related network and are incapable of capturing high -order dependencies in the biological heterogeneous graph. in this paper, we propose a metapath-aggregated heterogeneous graph neural network (mhgnn) to capture complex structures and rich semantics in the biological heterogeneous graph for dti prediction. specifically, mhgnn enhances heterogeneous graph structure learning and high -order semantics learning by modeling high -order relations via metapaths. additionally, mhgnn enriches high -order correlations between drug -target pairs (dtps) by constructing a dtp correlation graph with dtps as nodes. we conduct extensive experiments on three biological heterogeneous datasets. mhgnn favorably surpasses 17 state-of-the-art methods over 6 evaluation metrics, which verifies its efficacy for dti prediction. the code is available at https://github.com/zora- lm/mhgnn- dti.",AB_0265
"recent studies have revealed that long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) are closely linked to several human diseases, providing new opportunities for their use in detection and therapy. many graph propagation and similarity fusion approaches can be used for predicting potential lncrna-disease associations. however, existing similarity fusion approaches suffer from noise and self-similarity loss in the fusion process. to address these problems, a new prediction approach, termed ssmf-blnp, based on organically combining selective similarity matrix fusion (ssmf) and bidirectional linear neighborhood label propagation (blnp), is proposed in this paper to predict lncrna-disease associations. in ssmf, self-similarity networks of lncrnas and diseases are obtained by selective preprocessing and nonlinear iterative fusion. the fusion process assigns weights to each initial similarity network and introduces a unit matrix that can reduce noise and compensate for the loss of self-similarity. in blnp, the initial lncrna-disease associations are employed in both lncrna and disease directions as label information for linear neighborhood label propagation. the propagation was then performed on the self-similarity network obtained from ssmf to derive the scoring matrix for predicting the relationships between lncrnas and diseases. experimental results showed that ssmf-blnp performed better than seven other state of-the-art approaches. furthermore, a case study demonstrated up to 100% and 80% accuracy in 10 lncrnas associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and 10 lncrnas associated with renal cell carcinoma, respectively. the source code and datasets used in this paper are available at: https://github.com/ruibingo/ssmf-blnp.",AB_0265
