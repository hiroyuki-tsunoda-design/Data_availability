"motivation: advances in technology have generated larger omics datasets with potential applications for machine learning. in many datasets, however, cost and limited sample availability result in an excessively higher number of features as compared to observations. moreover, biological processes are associated with networks of core and peripheral genes, while traditional feature selection approaches capture only core genes. results: to overcome these limitations, we present drfetools that implements dynamic recursive feature elimination (rfe), reducing computational time with high accuracy compared to standard rfe, expanding dynamic rfe to regression algorithms, and outputting the subsets of features that hold predictive power with and without peripheral features. drfetools integrates with scikit-learn (the popular python machine learning platform) and thus provides new opportunities for dynamic rfe in large-scale omics data while enhancing its interpretability. availability and implementation: drfetools is freely available on pypi at https://pypi.org/project/drfetools/ or on github https://github.com/lieberinstitute/drfetools, implemented in python 3, and supported on linux, windows, and mac os.",AB_0604
"nearest neighbor search, also known as nns, is a technique used to locate the points in a high-dimensional space closest to a given query point. this technique has multiple applications in medicine, such as searching large medical imaging databases, disease classification, and diagnosis. however, when the number of points is significantly large, the brute-force approach for finding the nearest neighbor becomes computationally infeasible. therefore, various approaches have been developed to make the search faster and more efficient to support the applications. with a focus on medical imaging, this paper proposes denselinksearch (dls), an effective and efficient algorithm that searches and retrieves the relevant images from heterogeneous sources of medical images. towards this, given a medical database, the proposed algorithm builds an index that consists of pre-computed links of each point in the database. the search algorithm utilizes the index to efficiently traverse the database in search of the nearest neighbor. we also explore the role of medical image feature representation in content-based medical image retrieval tasks. we propose a transformer-based feature representation technique that outperformed the existing pre-trained transformer-based approaches on benchmark medical image retrieval datasets. we extensively tested the proposed nns approach and compared the performance with state-of-the-art nns approaches on benchmark datasets and our created medical image datasets. the proposed approach outperformed the existing approaches in terms of retrieving accurate neighbors and retrieval speed. in comparison to the existing approximate nns approaches, our proposed dls approach outperformed them in terms of lower average time per query and & ge; 99% r@10 on 11 out of 13 benchmark datasets. we also found that the proposed medical feature representation approach is better for representing medical images compared to the existing pre-trained image models. the proposed feature extraction strategy obtained an improvement of 9.37%, 7.0%, and 13.33% in terms of p@5, p@10, and p@20, respectively, in comparison to the best-performing pre-trained image model. the source code and datasets of our experiments are available at https://github.com/deepaknlp/dls.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0604
"many existing software libraries for genomics require researchers to pick between competing considerations: the performance of compiled languages and the accessibility of interpreted languages. go, a modern compiled language, provides an opportunity to address this conflict. we introduce gonomics, an open-source collection of command line programs and bioinformatic libraries implemented in go that unites readability and performance for genomic analyses. gonomics contains packages to read, write, and manipulate a wide array of file formats (e.g. fasta, fastq, bed, bedpe, sam, bam, and vcf), and can convert and interface between these formats. furthermore, our modular library structure provides a flexible platform for researchers developing their own software tools to address specific questions. these commands can be combined and incorporated into complex pipelines to meet the growing need for high-performance bioinformatic resources. availability and implementation: gonomics is implemented in the go programming language. source code, installation instructions, and documentation are freely available at https://github.com/vertgenlab/gonomics.",AB_0604
"resistance to two classes of fda-approved therapies that target dna repair-deficient tumors is caused by mutations that restore the tumor cell's dna repair function. identifying these reversion mutations currently requires manual annotation of patient tumor sequence data. here we present aardvark, an r package that automatically identifies reversion mutations from dna sequence data. availability and implementation: aardvark is implemented in r (>= 3.5). it is available on github at https://github.com/davidquigley/aardvark. it is licensed under the mit license.",AB_0604
"motivation: protein thermostability is of great interest, both in theory and in practice. results: this study compared orthologous proteins with different cellular thermostability. a large number of physicochemical properties of protein were calculated and used to develop a series of machine learning models for predicting cellular thermostability differences between orthologous proteins. most of the important features in these models are also highly correlated to relative cellular thermostability. a comparison between the present study with previous comparison of orthologous proteins from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms found that most highly correlated features are consistent in these studies, suggesting they may be important to protein thermostability. availability and implementation: data freely available for download at https://github.com/fangj3/cellular-protein-thermostability-dataset.",AB_0604
"many chronic disease symptomatologies involve desynchronized sleep-wake cycles, indicative of disrupted biorhythms. this can be interrogated using body temperature rhythms, which have circadian as well as sleep-wake behavior/environmental evoked components. here, we investigated the association of wrist temperature amplitudes with a future onset of disease in the uk biobank one year after actigraphy. among 425 disease conditions (range n = 200-6728) compared to controls (range n = 62,107-91,134), a total of 73 (17%) disease phenotypes were significantly associated with decreased amplitudes of wrist temperature (benjamini-hochberg fdr q < 0.05) and 26 (6.1%) phecodes passed a more stringent significance level (bonferroni-correction alpha < 0.05). a two-standard deviation (1.8 degrees celsius) lower wrist temperature amplitude corresponded to hazard ratios of 1.91 (1.58-2.31 95% ci) for nafld, 1.69 (1.53-1.88) for type 2 diabetes, 1.25 (1.14-1.37) for renal failure, 1.23 (1.17-1.3) for hypertension, and 1.22 (1.11-1.33) for pneumonia (phenome-wide atlas available at http://bioinf.itmat.upenn.edu/biorhythm_atlas/). this work suggests peripheral thermoregulation as a digital biomarker.",AB_0604
"ion mobility coupled to mass spectrometry informs on the shape and size of protein structures in the form of a collision cross section (ccsim). although there are several computational methods for predicting ccsim based on protein structures, including our previously developed projection approximation using rough circular shapes (parcs), the process usually requires prior experience with the command-line interface. to overcome this challenge, here we present a web application on the rosetta online server that includes everyone (rosie) webserver to predict ccsim from protein structure using projection approximation with parcs. in this web interface, the user is only required to provide one or more pdb files as input. results from our case studies suggest that ccsim predictions (with rosie-parcs) are highly accurate with an average error of 6.12%. furthermore, the absolute difference between ccsim and ccsparcs can help in distinguishing accurate from inaccurate alphafold2 protein structure predictions. rosie-parcs is designed with a user-friendly interface, is available publicly and is free to use. the rosie-parcs web interface is supported by all major web browsers and can be accessed via this link (https://rosie.graylab.jhu.edu).",AB_0604
"motivation: the tertiary structures of an increasing number of biological macromolecules have been determined using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-em). however, there are still many cases where the resolution is not high enough to model the molecular structures with standard computational tools. if the resolution obtained is near the empirical borderline (3-4.5a degrees), improvement in the map quality facilitates structure modeling. results: we report em-gan, a novel approach that modifies an input cryo-em map to assist protein structure modeling. the method uses a 3d generative adversarial network (gan) that has been trained on high- and low-resolution density maps to learn the density patterns, and modifies the input map to enhance its suitability for modeling. the method was tested extensively on a dataset of 65 em maps in the resolution range of 3-6a degrees and showed substantial improvements in structure modeling using popular protein structure modeling tools. availability and implementation: https://github.com/kiharalab/em-gan, google colab: https://tinyurl.com/3ccxpttx.",AB_0604
"motivation: the rapid advance in single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) technology over the past decade has provided a rich resource of gene expression profiles of single cells measured on patients, facilitating the study of many biological questions at the single-cell level. one intriguing research is to study the single cells which play critical roles in the phenotypes of patients, which has the potential to identify those cells and genes driving the disease phenotypes. to this end, deep learning models are expected to well encode the single-cell information and achieve precise prediction of patients' phenotypes using scrna-seq data. however, we are facing critical challenges in designing deep learning models for classifying patient samples due to (i) the samples collected in the same dataset contain a variable number of cells-some samples might only have hundreds of cells sequenced while others could have thousands of cells, and (ii) the number of samples available is typically small and the expression profile of each cell is noisy and extremely high-dimensional. moreover, the black-box nature of existing deep learning models makes it difficult for the researchers to interpret the models and extract useful knowledge from them. results: we propose a prototype-based and cell-informed model for patient phenotype classification, termed protocell4p, that can alleviate problems of the sample scarcity and the diverse number of cells by leveraging the cell knowledge with representatives of cells (called prototypes), and precisely classify the patients by adaptively incorporating information from different cells. moreover, this classification process can be explicitly interpreted by identifying the key cells for decision making and by further summarizing the knowledge of cell types to unravel the biological nature of the classification. our approach is explainable at the single-cell resolution which can identify the key cells in each patient's classification. the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively deal with patient classifications using single-cell data and outperforms the existing approaches. furthermore, our approach is able to uncover the association between cell types and biological classes of interest from a data-driven perspective. availability and implementation: https://github.com/teddy-xionggz/protocell4p.",AB_0604
