"introduction: interventions to promote health and well-being based on the construction of psychological resources can positively impact the daily life of users and foster human flourishing. nowadays, mobile health represents a safe way to support health research and implement evidence-based psychological interventions. the present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile app-based intervention program (oneus) designed to cultivate positive emotions and positive thinking to improve overall well-being. methods: the study is designed as a randomized controlled trial. two hundred participants will be randomly assigned to either a mobile health intervention condition (oneus app) or an active control condition. the intervention consists of a program to cultivate positive emotions and positive thoughts. the active control intervention will comprise a set of mental imagery exercises and daily routine recording. the primary outcome comprises optimal well-being assessed using the multidimensional perma-profiler scale. the sample will include adult people from the general population, who will be assessed at 8 time points: baseline (t1), intervention (t2, t3, t4, t5, t6) post-intervention (t7) and 3-month follow-up (t8). discussion: mobile apps seem to be promising tools to promote health and wellbeing. this study will evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile app (oneus) aiming to cultivate positive emotions and positive thinking to improve well-being. the main strength of this study is the development of an evidence-based mobile health app, based on intentional mental training, to promote well-being. the limitations of this study relate to potential participant drop-out and the non-generalizability of the results to clinical populations. clinical trial registration: https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/rbr-43hpwqk, identifier rbr-43hpwqk.",AB_0423
"objectives: to present and execute a protocol for the capture of 3d facial images using pho-togrammetry through the open access software blender and its add-on ortogonblender (oob) and to evaluate the compatibility of the 3d meshes generated with computed tomography (ct) of the sinuses.methods: individuals >18 years old, candidates for rhinoseptoplasty in a tertiary hospital, were submitted to a photographic session to perform the standardized protocol. in the session, divided into 3 phases, sequential photos were taken for processing the photogrammetry in the oob and producing 3d meshes of the face. the photogrammetry reconstructions were compared with the reference mesh of the soft tissue surface of the sinus ct scan to assess compatibility between them.results: 21 patients were included, 67% female. 3 photogrammetry meshes and 1 ct reference mesh were generated, which demonstrated matching compatibility, as most of the mean dis-tances between cloud points were <1.48 mm. phase 3 of the session with the highest number of photos (54.36 & plusmn; 15.05) generated the most satisfactory mesh with the best resolution.conclusions: the proposed protocol is reproducible and feasible in clinical practice, generated satisfactory 3d meshes of the face, being a potential tool for surgical planning and comparison of results. for the implementation of photogrammetry for use in 3d anthropometry, it is necessary to validate this method.level of evidence: 3.ocebm levels of evidence working group.1 t & bull;he oxford 2011 levels of evidence.& bull; oxford centre for evidence-based medicine. http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=5653 & copy; 2023 associacao brasileira de otorrinolaringologia e cirurgia c & prime;ervico-facial. published by elsevier espan & sim;a, s.l.u. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0423
"purpose or objective: melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer and the discovery of novel drugs is an ongoing effort. quantitative structure activity relationship (qsar) is a computational method that allows the estimation of the properties of a molecule, including its biological activity. qsar models have been widely employed in the search for potential drug candidates, but also for agrochemicals and other molecules with ap-plications in different branches of the industry. here we present bambu, a simple command line tool to generate qsar models from high-throughput screening bioassays datasets.methods: the tool was developed using the python programming language and relies mainly on rdkit for molecule data manipulation, flaml for automated machine learning and the pubchem rest api for data retrieval. as a proof-of-concept we have employed the tool to generate qsar models for melanoma cell growth inhibition based on hts data and used them to screen libraries of fda-approved drugs and natural compounds. additionally, bambu was compared to qsar-co, another automated tool for qsar model generation.results: based on the developed tool we were able to produce qsar models and identify a wide variety of molecules with potential melanoma cell growth inhibitors, many of which with anti-tumoral activity already described. the qsar models are available through the url http://caramel.ufpel.edu.br, and all data and code used to generate its models are available at zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7495214). bambu source code is available at github (https://github.com/omixlab/bambu-v2). in the benchmark, bambu was able to produce models with higher accuracy, recall, f1 and roc auc when compared to qsar-co for the selected datasets.conclusions: bambu is an free and open source tool which facilitates the creation of qsar models and can be futurely applied in a wide variety of drug discovery projects.",AB_0423
"pseudouridine (& psi;) is reported to occur frequently in all types of rna. this uridine modification has been shown to be essential for processes such as rna stability and stress response. also, it is linked to a few human diseases, such as prostate cancer, anemia, etc. a few laboratory techniques, such as pseudo-seq and n3-cmc-enriched pseudouridine sequencing (ceu-seq) are used for detecting & psi; sites. however, these are laborious and drawnout methods. the convenience of sequencing data has enabled the development of computationally intelligent models for improving & psi; site identification methods. the proposed work provides a prediction model for the identification of & psi; sites through popular ensemble methods such as stacking, bagging, and boosting. features were obtained through a novel feature extraction mechanism with the assimilation of statistical moments, which were used to train ensemble models. the cross-validation test and independent set test were used to evaluate the precision of the trained models. the proposed model outperformed the preexisting predictors and revealed 87% accuracy, 0.90 specificity, 0.85 sensitivity, and a 0.75 matthews correlation coefficient. a web server has been built and is available publicly for the researchers at https://taseersuleman-y-test-pseu-pred-c2wmtj.streamlit. app/.",AB_0423
"generating learning-friendly representations for points in space is a fundamental and long-standing problem in machine learning. recently, multi-scale encoding schemes (such as space2vec and nerf) were proposed to directly encode any point in 2d or 3d euclidean space as a high-dimensional vector, and has been successfully applied to various (geo)spatial prediction and generative tasks. however, all current 2d and 3d location encoders are designed to model point distances in euclidean space. so when applied to large-scale real-world gps coordinate datasets (e.g., species or satellite images taken all over the world), which require distance metric learning on the spherical surface, both types of models can fail due to the map projection distortion problem (2d) and the spherical-to-euclidean distance approximation error (3d). to solve these problems, we propose a multi-scale location encoder called sphere2vec which can preserve spherical distances when encoding point coordinates on a spherical surface. we developed a unified view of distance-reserving encoding on spheres based on the double fourier sphere (dfs). we also provide theoretical proof that the sphere2vec encoding preserves the spherical surface distance between any two points, while existing encoding schemes such as space2vec and nerf do not. experiments on 20 synthetic datasets show that sphere2vec can outperform all baseline models including the state-of-the-art (sota) 2d location encoder (i.e., space2vec) and 3d encoder nerf on all these datasets with up to 30.8% error rate reduction. we then apply sphere2vec to three geo-aware image classification tasks -fine-grained species recognition, flickr image recognition, and remote sensing image classification. results on 7 real-world datasets show the superiority of sphere2vec over multiple 2d and 3d location encoders on all three tasks. further analysis shows that sphere2vec outperforms other location encoder models, especially in the polar regions and data-sparse areas because of its nature for spherical surface distance preservation. code and data of this work are available at https://gengchenmai.github.io/sphere2vec-website/.",AB_0423
"the detection and segmentation of cerebral aneurysms is a crucial step in the development of a clinical decision support system for estimating aneurysm rupture risk. however, accurately identifying and segmenting regions of interest in two-dimensional (2d) medical images is often challenging, particularly when using deep learning (dl) methods on small datasets with limited annotated data. the accuracy of dl approaches is often affected by the availability of large, annotated training datasets that are required for effective deep learning. additionally, when using dl to differentiate aneurysms from arterial loops in 2d dsa images, dl can fail to detect aneurysms in areas where dye concentration is low. to address these issues and enhance the reliability and accuracy of aneurysm detection and segmentation methods, incorporating medical expert-advised, hand-crafted features can provide a clinical perspective to dl methods. this approach can help to improve the performance of dl methods by providing additional information that is not captured in the data. to this end, a novel neuro-symbolic ai-based deepinfusion model is proposed which allows for the infusion of human intellect through handcrafted features into deep neural networks (dnns), thus combining the strengths of dl with the knowledge and expertise of medical professionals. the proposed approach includes a novel technique for dynamic layer selection and feature weight adjustment during the model infusion process. the performance of the deepinfusion model is evaluated on an in-house prepared dataset of 409 dsa images, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the segmentation of cerebral aneurysms. the model achieves an iou score of 96.76% and an f1-score of 94.15% on unseen dsa images. the model is also tested on two publicly available datasets of kvasir-seg polyp and drive for vessel segmentation of retinal images. the results show a significant improvement compared to existing methods, which indicates the generalizability of the approach in medical segmentation. the complete code for deepinfusion is available on our github repository at https://github.com/smileslab/deep-infusion/blob/main/deepinfusion.ipynb.",AB_0423
"the trna adaptation index (tai) is a translation efficiency metric that considers weighted values (s-ij values) for codon-trna wobble interaction efficiencies. the initial implementation of the tai had significant flaws. for instance, generated s-ij weights were optimized based on gene expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is expected to vary among different species. consequently, a species-specific approach (stai) was developed to overcome those limitations. however, the stai method employed a hill climbing algorithm to optimize the s(ij )weights, which is not ideal for obtaining the best set of s-ij weights because it could struggle to find the global maximum given a complex search space, even after using different starting positions. in addition, it did not perform well in computing the tai of fungal genomes in comparison with the original implementation. we developed a novel approach named genetic tai (gtai) implemented as a python package (https://github.com/aliyoussef96/gtai), which employs a genetic algorithm to obtain the best set of s(ij )weights and follows a new codon usage-based workflow that better computes the tai of genomes from the three domains of life. the gtai has significantly improved the correlation with the codon adaptation index (cai) and the prediction of protein abundance (empirical data) compared to the stai.",AB_0423
"aerial imagery and video recordings of animals are used for many areas of research such as animal behaviour, behavioural neuroscience and field biology. many automated methods are being developed to extract data from such high-resolution videos. most of the available tools are developed for videos taken under idealised laboratory conditions. therefore, the task of animal detection and tracking for videos taken in natural settings remains challenging due to heterogeneous environments. methods that are useful for field conditions are often difficult to implement and thus remain inaccessible to empirical researchers. to address this gap, we present an open-source package called multi-object tracking in heterogeneous environments (mothe), a pythonbased application that uses a basic convolutional neural network for object detection. mothe offers a graphical interface to automate the various steps related to animal tracking such as training data generation, animal detection in complex backgrounds and visually tracking animals in the videos. users can also generate training data and train a new model which can be used for object detection tasks for a completely new dataset. mothe doesn't require any sophisticated infrastructure and can be run on basic desktop computing units. we demonstrate mothe on six video clips in varying background conditions. these videos are from two species in their natural habitat- wasp colonies on their nests (up to 12 individuals per colony) and antelope herds in four different habitats (up to 156 individuals in a herd). using mothe, we are able to detect and track individuals in all these videos. mothe is available as an open-source github repository with a detailed user guide and demonstrations at: https://github.com/tee-lab/mothe-gui.",AB_0423
"the structural investigation of intrinsically disordered proteins (idps) requires ensemble models describ-ing the diversity of the conformational states of the molecule. due to their probabilistic nature, there is a need for new paradigms that understand and treat idps from a purely statistical point of view, considering their conformational ensembles as well-defined probability distributions. in this work, we define a confor-mational ensemble as an ordered set of probability distributions and provide a suitable metric to detect differences between two given ensembles at the residue level, both locally and globally. the underlying geometry of the conformational space is properly integrated, one ensemble being characterized by a set of probability distributions supported on the three-dimensional euclidean space (for global-scale com-parisons) and on the two-dimensional flat torus (for local-scale comparisons). the inherent uncertainty of the data is also taken into account to provide finer estimations of the differences between ensembles. additionally, an overall distance between ensembles is defined from the differences at the residue level. we illustrate the potential of the approach with several examples of applications for the comparison of conformational ensembles: (i) produced from molecular dynamics (md) simulations using different force fields, and (ii) before and after refinement with experimental data. we also show the usefulness of the method to assess the convergence of md simulations, and discuss other potential applications such as in machine-learning-based approaches. the numerical tool has been implemented in python through easy-to-use jupyter notebooks available at https://gitlab.laas.fr/moma/wasco.

"federated learning is a very convenient approach for scenarios where (i) the exchange of data implies privacy concerns and/or (ii) a quick reaction is needed. in smart healthcare systems, both aspects are usually required. in this paper, we work on the first scenario, where preserving privacy is key and, consequently, building a unique and massive medical image data set by fusing different data sets from different medical institutions or research centers (computation nodes) is not an option. we propose an ensemble federated learning (efl) approach that is based on the following characteristics: first, each computation node works with a different data set (but of the same type). they work locally and apply an ensemble approach combining eight well-known cnn models (densenet169, mobilenetv2, xception, inceptionv3, vgg16, resnet50, densenet121, and resnet152v2) on chest x-ray images. second, the best two local models are used to create a local ensemble model that is shared with a central node. third, the ensemble models are aggregated to obtain a global model, which is shared with the computation nodes to continue with a new iteration. this procedure continues until there are no changes in the best local models. we have performed different experiments to compare our approach with centralized ones (with or without an ensemble approach). the results conclude that our proposal outperforms these ones in chest x-ray images (achieving an accuracy of 96.63%) and offers very competitive results compared to other proposals in the literature. a source code is provided at the code ocean repository: https://codeocean.com/capsule/0530602/tree.",AB_0423
