"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) requires the fast discovery of effective treatments to fight this worldwide concern. several genes associated with the sars-cov-2, which are essential for its functionality, pathogenesis, and survival, have been identified. these genes, which play crucial roles in sars-cov-2 infection, are considered potential therapeutic targets. developing drugs against these essential genes to inhibit their regular functions could be a good approach for covid-19 treatment. artificial intelligence and machine learning methods provide powerful infrastructures for interpreting and understanding the available data and can assist in finding fast explanations and cures. we propose a method to highlight the essential genes that play crucial roles in sars-cov-2 pathogenesis. for this purpose, we define eleven informative topological and biological features for the biological and ppi networks constructed on gene sets that correspond to covid-19. then, we use three different unsupervised learning algorithms with different approaches to rank the important genes with respect to our defined informative features. finally, we present a set of 18 important genes related to covid-19. materials and implementations are available at: https://github.com/mahnazhabibi/gene_analysis.",AB_0511
"motivation mediation analysis is performed to evaluate the effects of a hypothetical causal mechanism that marks the progression from an exposure, through mediators, to an outcome. in the age of high-throughput technologies, it has become routine to assess numerous potential mechanisms at the genome or proteome scales. alongside this, the necessity to address issues related to multiple testing has also arisen. in a sparse scenario where only a few genes or proteins are causally involved, conventional methods for assessing mediation effects lose statistical power because the composite null distribution behind this experiment cannot be attained. the power loss hence decreases the true mechanisms identified after multiple testing corrections. to fairly delineate a uniform distribution under the composite null, huang (genome-wide analyses of sparse mediation effects under composite null hypotheses. ann appl stat 2019a;13:60-84; aoas) proposed the composite test to provide adjusted p-values for single-mediator analyses.results our contribution is to extend the method to multimediator analyses, which are commonly encountered in genomic studies and also flexible to various biological interests. using the generalized berk-jones statistics with the composite test, we proposed a multivariate approach that favors dense and diverse mediation effects, a decorrelation approach that favors sparse and consistent effects, and a hybrid approach that captures the edges of both approaches. our analysis suite has been implemented as an r package mactest. the utility is demonstrated by analyzing the lung adenocarcinoma datasets from the cancer genome atlas and clinical proteomic tumor analysis consortium. we further investigate the genes and networks whose expression may be regulated by smoking-induced epigenetic aberrations.availability and implementation an r package mactest is available on https://github.com/roqe/mactest.",AB_0511
"the main aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of people in severe social isolation as a proxy for high risk of hikikomori using data from 29 european countries. the relationship between the presence/absence of severe social isolation and demographic and psychosocial variables was also investigated. publicly available data from the european social survey (ess) round 9 collected between august 2018 and january 2020 were used. data from the ess round 1 (september 2002 -december 2003) and round 10 (september 2020 -may 2022) were also examined to investigate changes in the prevalence of severe social isolation over time. analyses were restricted to the working-age population (15-64 years). a complex sampling design to obtain weighted prevalence and results was used. the study protocol was preregistered online on the open science framework (https://osf.io/6a7br/). the weighted prevalence of severe social isolation was 2.01% for the sample from the ess 1, 1.77% for the sample from the ess 9, and 1.71% for the sample from the ess 10, indicating a decrease over time, mainly in males. logistic regression models showed that different sociodemographic factors (e.g., being retired, being permanently sick or disabled, doing housework, living in central and eastern europe, living uncomfortably on household income, having no income) were associated with severe social isolation. further, feeling unsafe when walking alone in the neighbourhood after dark, low social trust, and support, decreased happiness and lack of future planning correlated with severe social isolation after adjustment for the effect of sociodemographic factors was made. in this study, the prevalence of severe social isolation as a proxy for hikikomori in european countries is in line with that found by previous representative studies conducted in asian countries. the novelty of the findings as well as implications for hikikomori research are discussed according to recent scientific literature.",AB_0511
"in order to solve optimization problems, this paper introduces a new metaheuristic algorithm called the numeric crunch algorithm (nca), which employs the distribution behaviour of the population members and a novel hyperbolic acceleration function for convergence. each generation's search space exploration and exploitation are ensured by the population's distribution behaviour around its members and their adaptively diversified boundaries, respectively. the convergence of the search solutions in the nca was also accelerated by the random, adaptive parameters and hyperbolic function. a set of 68 test benchmark functions with (30, 100, 500, and 1000) dimensions was used to examine the nca's effectiveness in terms of exploration, exploitation, local optimality avoidance, population fitness enhancement, and convergence rate. firstly, the proposed nca's behaviour is examined using a collection of 23 standard well-known benchmark functions, including unimodal, multimodal, and fixed-dimensional functions. secondly, the proposed nca's superiority is examined using the ieee cec-2015 and ieee cec-2017 benchmark suites. in addition to qualitatively examine nca's superiority over other metaheuristics, friedman and wilcoxon rank-sum tests are performed. in terms of performance metrics, nca ranked first. for application perspective, the nca is tested on eight real-world constrained and unconstrained engineering design problems from ieee cec-2020 real-world optimization benchmark suits. the nca algorithm's performance on benchmark functions and engineering design problems indicates that it can handle constrained and uncertain search spaces in real-world scenarios. the source code of the nca algorithm is publicly available at https://github.com/shivankur07/numeric-crunch-algorithm.git.",AB_0511
"backgroundwhile assessment tools can increase the detection of cognitive impairment, there is currently insufficient evidence regarding clinical outcomes based on screening for cognitive impairment in older adults.methodsthe study purpose was to investigate whether timed up and go dual-task test (tugdt) results, based on tug combined with two different verbal tasks (name different animals, tugdt-na, and recite months in reverse order, tugdt-mb), predicted dementia incidence over a period of five years among patients (n = 186, mean = 70.7 years; 45.7% female) diagnosed with subjective cognitive impairment (sci) and mild cognitive impairment (mci) following assessment at two memory clinics. associations between tug parameters and dementia incidence were examined in cox regression models.resultsduring follow-up time (median (range) 3.7 (0.1-6.1) years) 98 participants converted to dementia. novel findings indicated that the tugdt parameter words/time, after adjustment for age, gender, and education, can be used for the prediction of conversion to dementia in participants with sci or mci over a period of five years. among the tug-related parameters investigated, words/time showed the best predictive capacity, while time scores of tug and tugdt as well as tugdt cost did not produce significant predictive results. results further showed that the step parameter step length during tugdt predicts conversion to dementia before adjustment for age, gender, and education. optimal tugdt cutoffs for predicting dementia at 2- and 4-year follow-up based on words/time were calculated. the sensitivity of the tugdt cutoffs was high at 2-year follow-up: tugdt-na words/time, 0.79; tugdt-mb words/time, 0.71; reducing respectively to 0.64 and 0.65 at 4-year follow-up.conclusionstugdt words/time parameters have potential as cost-efficient tools for conversion-to-dementia risk assessment, useful for research and clinical purposes. these parameters may be able to bridge the gap of insufficient evidence for such clinical outcomes.trial registrationclinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct05893524: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/nct05893524?id=nct05893524 & rank=1.",AB_0511
"the incorporation of machine learning methods into proteomics workflows improves the identification of disease-relevant biomarkers and biological pathways. however, machine learning models, such as deep neural networks, typically suffer from lack of interpretability. here, we present a deep learning approach to combine biological pathway analysis and biomarker identification to increase the interpretability of proteomics experiments. our approach integrates a priori knowledge of the relationships between proteins and biological pathways and biological processes into sparse neural networks to create biologically informed neural networks. we employ these networks to differentiate between clinical subphenotypes of septic acute kidney injury and covid-19, as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome of different aetiologies. to gain biological insight into the complex syndromes, we utilize feature attribution-methods to introspect the networks for the identification of proteins and pathways important for distinguishing between subtypes. the algorithms are implemented in a freely available open source python-package (https://github.com/infectionmedicineproteomics/binn). deep neural networks hold significant promise in capturing the complexity of biological systems. however, they suffer from a lack of interpretability. here, authors present a generalizable method for developing, interpreting, and visualizing biologically informed neural networks for proteomics data.",AB_0511
"objectiveexhaustion disorder is a stress-related diagnosis that was introduced in 2005 to the swedish version of the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems, 10th edition (icd-10). the karolinska exhaustion disorder scale (keds) was developed to assess exhaustion disorder symptomatology. while the keds is intended to reflect a single construct and be used based on its total score, the instrument's characteristics have received limited attention. this study investigated the keds's psychometric and structural properties in a large clinical sample.methodsthe study relied on data from 1,072 patients diagnosed with exhaustion disorder that were included in two clinical trials in sweden. we investigated the dimensionality, homogeneity, and reliability of the keds using advanced statistical techniques, including exploratory structural equation modeling (esem) bifactor analysis.resultsa one-factor confirmatory analytic model exhibited a poor fit, suggesting at least a degree of multidimensionality. the esem bifactor analysis found the general factor to explain about 72% of the common variance extracted, with an omega hierarchical coefficient of 0.680. thus, the esem bifactor analysis did not clearly support the scale's essential unidimensionality. a homogeneity analysis revealed a scale-level h of only 0.296, suggesting that keds's total scores do not accurately rank individuals on the latent continuum assumed to underlie the measure. the keds's reliability was modest, signaling considerable measurement error.conclusionfindings reveal important limitations to the keds with possible implications for the status of exhaustion disorder as a nosological category.trial registrationthis study was pre-registered on open science framework (osf.io) on april 24, 2022 (https://osf.io/p34sq/).",AB_0511
"motivation as an important player in transcriptome regulation, micrornas may effectively diffuse somatic mutation impacts to broad cellular processes and ultimately manifest disease and dictate prognosis. previous studies that tried to correlate mutation with gene expression dysregulation neglected to adjust for the disparate multitudes of false positives associated with unequal sample sizes and uneven class balancing scenarios.results to properly address this issue, we developed a statistical framework to rigorously assess the extent of mutation impact on micrornas in relation to a permutation-based null distribution of a matching sample structure. carrying out the framework in a pan-cancer study, we ascertained 9008 protein-coding genes with statistically significant mutation impacts on mirnas. of these, the collective mirna expression for 83 genes showed significant prognostic power in nine cancer types. for example, in lower-grade glioma, 10 genes' mutations broadly impacted mirnas, all of which showed prognostic value with the corresponding mirna expression. our framework was further validated with functional analysis and augmented with rich features including the ability to analyze mirna isoforms; aggregative prognostic analysis; advanced annotations such as mutation type, regulator alteration, somatic motif, and disease association; and instructive visualization such as mutation oncoprint, ideogram, and interactive mrna-mirna network.availability and implementation the data underlying this article are available in mutmix, at http://innovebioinfo.com/database/tmiex/mutmix.php.",AB_0511
"purpose - low performance life and increased machine downtime due to wear of resistance welding copper electrode is of major concern in fin-tube resistance welding in waste heat recovery boilers. the purpose of this study is to investigate an alternative material with good wear resistance to replace the currently utilized c11000 electrolytic tough pitch (etp) copper electrode. design/methodology/approach - in this study, a cu-cr-zr ternary alloy was developed for fin-to-tube welding electrode by melting commercial grade electrolytic copper (99.9% purity) plates, chips of chromium, powder of zirconium at 1100 degrees-1300 degrees c, followed by hot forging and precipitation hardening at 450 degrees-550 degrees c to attain appropriate grain flow. microstructures of cu-cr-zr alloys were analysed using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive backscatter electron spectrometry. findings - wear performance of cu-cr-zr and c11000 etp cu was evaluated using pin-on-disc set-up with taguchi's l-8 orthogonal array. ranking of the parameters was done, and it was observed that the material and temperature play a very significant role in controlling the wear of an electrode. practical implications - rate of fin-tube resistance welding was increased by 26% with cu-cr-zr alloy. further investigation on effect of plasma on the metallurgical characteristics of cu-cr-zr is recommended. originality/value tribo-mechanical performance of newly developed cu-cr-zr ternary alloy was compared with c11000 etp copper. peer review - the peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/ilt-04-2023-0092/",AB_0511
"dna-binding proteins (dbps) play critical roles in many biological processes, including gene expression, dna replication, recombination and repair. understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes depends on the precise identification of dbps. in recent times, several computational methods have been developed to identify dbps. however, because of the generic nature of the models, these models are unable to identify species-specific dbps with higher accuracy. therefore, a species-specific computational model is needed to predict species-specific dbps. in this paper, we introduce the computational dbpmod method, which makes use of a machine learning approach to identify species-specific dbps. for prediction, both shallow learning algorithms and deep learning models were used, with shallow learning models achieving higher accuracy. additionally, the evolutionary features outperformed sequence-derived features in terms of accuracy. five model organisms, including caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster, escherichia coli, homo sapiens and mus musculus, were used to assess the performance of dbpmod. five-fold cross-validation and independent test set analyses were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy in terms of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (auroc) and area under precision-recall curve (auprc), which was found to be similar to 89-92% and similar to 89-95%, respectively. the comparative results demonstrate that the dbpmod outperforms 12 current state-of-the-art computational approaches in identifying the dbps for all five model organisms. we further developed the web server of dbpmod to make it easier for researchers to detect dbps and is publicly available at https://iasri-sg.icar.gov.in/dbpmod/. dbpmod is expected to be an invaluable tool for discovering dbps, supplementing the current experimental and computational methods.",AB_0511
