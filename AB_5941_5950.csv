"background innovative restructuring of cardiac rehabilitation (cr) delivery remains critical to reduce barriers and improve access to diverse populations. destination cardiac rehab is a novel virtual world technology-based cr program delivered through the virtual world platform, second life, which previously demonstrated high acceptability as an extension of traditional center-based cr. this study aims to evaluate efficacy and adherence of the virtual world-based cr program compared with center-based cr within a community-informed, implementation science framework.methods using a noninferiority, hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation, randomized controlled trial, 150 patients with an eligible cardiovascular event will be recruited from 6 geographically diverse cr centers across the united states. participants will be randomized 1:1 to either the 12-week destination cardiac rehab or the center-based cr control groups. the primary efficacy outcome is a composite cardiovascular health score based on the american heart association life's essential 8 at 3 and 6 months. adherence outcomes include cr session attendance and participation in exercise sessions. a diverse patient/caregiver/stakeholder advisory board was assembled to guide recruitment, implementation, and dissemination plans and to contextualize study findings. the institutional review board-approved randomized controlled trial will enroll and randomize patients to the intervention (or control group) in 3 consecutive waves/year over 3 years. the results will be published at data collection and analyses completion.conclusions the destination cardiac rehab randomized controlled trial tests an innovative and potentially scalable model to enhance cr participation and advance health equity. our findings will inform the use of effective virtual cr programs to expand equitable access to diverse patient populations.registration url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct05897710.",AB_0595
"motivation genome-wide association studies is an essential tool for analyzing associations between phenotypes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps). most of binary phenotypes in large biobanks are extremely unbalanced, which leads to inflated type i error rates for many widely used association tests for joint analysis of multiple phenotypes. in this article, we first propose a novel method to construct a multi-layer network (mln) using individuals with at least one case status among all phenotypes. then, we introduce a computationally efficient community detection method to group phenotypes into disjoint clusters based on the mln. finally, we propose a novel approach, mln with omnibus (mln-o), to jointly analyse the association between phenotypes and a snp. mln-o uses the score test to test the association of each merged phenotype in a cluster and a snp, then uses the omnibus test to obtain an overall test statistic to test the association between all phenotypes and a snp. results we conduct extensive simulation studies to reveal that the proposed approach can control type i error rates and is more powerful than some existing methods. meanwhile, we apply the proposed method to a real data set in the uk biobank. using phenotypes in chapter xiii (diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue) in the uk biobank, we find that mln-o identifies more significant snps than other methods we compare with. availability and implementation https://github.com/hongjing-xie/multi-layer-network-with-omnibus-mln-o.",AB_0595
"while vaccines are crucial to end the covid-19 pandemic, public confidence in vaccine safety has always been vulnerable. many statistical methtem) database to study the safety of covid-19 vaccines. however, none of these methods considered the adverse event (ae) ontology. aes are naturally related; for example, events of retching, dysphagia, and reflux are all related to an abnormal digestive system. explicitly bringing ae relationships into the model can aid in the detection of true ae signals amid the noise while reducing false positives. we propose a bayesian graph-assisted signal selection (bgrass) model to simultaneously estimate all aes while incorporating the network of dependence between aes. under a fully bayesian inference framework, we also propose a negative control approach to mitigate the reporting bias and an enrichment approach to detecting ae groups of concern. for posterior computation we construct an equivalent model representation and develop an efficient gibbs sampler. we evaluate the performance of bgrass via extensive simulations. to study the safety of covid-19 vaccines, we apply bgrass to analyze approximately one million vaers reports (01/01/2016-12/24/2021) involving more than 800 aes. in particular, we found that blood clots (including deep vein thrombosis, thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism) are more likely to be reported after covid-19 vaccination, compared to influenza vaccines. they are also reported more often for johnson & johnson-janssen vaccine, compared to mrna-based covid-19 vaccines. a user-friendly r package bgrass that implements the proposed methods to assess vaccine safety is included in the supplementary material and is publicly available at https://github.com/bangyaozhao/bgrass.",AB_0595
"categorizing individual cells into one of many known cell-type cate-gories, also known as cell-type annotation, is a critical step in the analy-sis of single-cell genomics data. the current process of annotation is time intensive and subjective, which has led to different studies describing cell types with labels of varying degrees of resolution. while supervised learn-ing approaches have provided automated solutions to annotation, there re-mains a significant challenge in fitting a unified model for multiple datasets with inconsistent labels. in this article we propose a new multinomial lo-gistic regression estimator which can be used to model cell-type probabil-ities by integrating multiple datasets with labels of varying resolution. to compute our estimator, we solve a nonconvex optimization problem using a blockwise proximal gradient descent algorithm. we show through simu-lation studies that our approach estimates cell-type probabilities more accu-rately than competitors in a wide variety of scenarios. we apply our method to 10 single-cell rna-seq datasets and demonstrate its utility in predicting fine resolution cell-type labels on unlabeled data as well as refining cell -type labels on data with existing coarse resolution annotations. finally, we demonstrate that our method can lead to novel scientific insights in the con-text of a differential expression analysis comparing peripheral blood gene expression before and after treatment with interferon-a. an r package im-plementing the method is available in the supplementary material and at https://github.com/keshav-motwani/ibmr, and the collection of datasets we analyze is available at https://github.com/keshav-motwani/annotatedpbmc.",AB_0595
"transcript annotations play a critical role in gene expression analysis as they serve as a reference for quantifying isoform-level expression. the two main sources of annotations are refseq and ensembl/gencode, but discrepancies between their methodologies and information resources can lead to significant differences. it has been demonstrated that the choice of annotation can have a significant impact on gene expression analysis. furthermore, transcript assembly is closely linked to annotations, as assembling large-scale available rna-seq data is an effective data-driven way to construct annotations, and annotations are often served as benchmarks to evaluate the accuracy of assembly methods. however, the influence of different annotations on transcript assembly is not yet fully understood. we investigate the impact of annotations on transcript assembly. surprisingly, we observe that opposite conclusions can arise when evaluating assemblers with different annotations. to understand this striking phenomenon, we compare the structural similarity of annotations at various levels and find that the primary structural difference across annotations occurs at the intron-chain level. next, we examine the biotypes of annotated and assembled transcripts and uncover a significant bias towards annotating and assembling transcripts with intron retentions, which explains above the contradictory conclusions. we develop a standalone tool, available at https://github.com/shao-group/irtool, that can be combined with an assembler to generate an assembly without intron retentions. we evaluate the performance of such a pipeline and offer guidance to select appropriate assembling tools for different application scenarios. transcript annotations are essential foundations for transcriptomic studies, offering valuable insights into gene structures, functions, and acting as references for isoform-level expression expression quantification and differential analysis. however, the impact of different annotations on transcript assembly remains uncertain. we demonstrated that the choice of an annotation can lead to conflicting outcomes when evaluating assemblers. our investigation revealed the distinctive features of annotations that led to the aforementioned contradictory conclusion, through a comprehensive comparison of annotations from the perspectives of biotypes and gene structures, contributing to a broader, deeper understanding of annotations. our research provides guidance in making well-informed choice of annotations and assemblers for practical rna-seq data analysis.",AB_0595
"efficiently circumventing the blood-brain barrier (bbb) poses a major hurdle in the development of drugs that target the central nervous system. although there are several methods to determine bbb permeability of small molecules, the parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (pampa) is one of the most common assays in drug discovery due to its robust and high-throughput nature. drug discovery is a long and costly venture, thus, any advances to streamline this process are beneficial. in this study, similar to 2,000 compounds from over 60 ncats projects were screened in the pampa-bbb assay to develop a quantitative structure-activity relationship model to predict bbb permeability of small molecules. after analyzing both state-of-the-art and latest machine learning methods, we found that random forest based on rdkit descriptors as additional features provided the best training balanced accuracy (0.70 +/- 0.015) and a message-passing variant of graph convolutional neural network that uses rdkit descriptors provided the highest balanced accuracy (0.72) on a prospective validation set. finally, we correlated in vitro pampa-bbb data with in vivo brain permeation data in rodents to observe a categorical correlation of 77%, suggesting that models developed using data from pampa-bbb can forecast in vivo brain permeability. given that majority of prior research has relied on in vitro or in vivo data for assessing bbb permeability, our model, developed using the largest pampa-bbb dataset to date, offers an orthogonal means to estimate bbb permeability of small molecules. we deposited a subset of our data into pubchem bioassay database (aid: 1845228) and deployed the best performing model on the ncats open data adme portal (https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/adme/). these initiatives were undertaken with the aim of providing valuable resources for the drug discovery community.",AB_0595
"we present a lightweight, flexible, and high-performance framework for inferring the properties of gravitational-wave events. by combining likelihood heterodyning, automatically differentiable, and accelerator-compatible waveforms, and gradient-based markov chain monte carlo sampling enhanced by normalizing flows, we achieve full bayesian parameter estimation for real events like gw150914 and gw170817 within a minute of sampling time. our framework does not require pretraining or explicit reparameterizations and can be generalized to handle higher dimensional problems. we present the details of our implementation and discuss trade-offs and future developments in the context of other proposed strategies for real-time parameter estimation. our code for running the analysis is publicly available on github at https://github.com/kazewong/jim.",AB_0595
"objectives. to assess the association between the new york secure ammunition and firearms enforcement act (ny safe act) and firearm suicide and homicide rates.methods. we employed a synthetic controls approach to investigate the impact of the ny safe act on firearm suicide and firearm homicide rates. we collected state-level data on firearm mortality from the centers for disease control and prevention's wide-ranging online data for epidemiologic research (wonder) database for the period 1999-2019. we derived statistical inference by using a permutation based in-place placebo test.results. the implementation of the ny safe act was associated with a significant reduction in firearm homicide rates, demonstrating a decrease of 63%. this decrease corresponds to an estimated prevention of 1697 deaths between 2013 and 2019. however, there was no association between the ny safe act and firearm suicide rates.conclusions. as the responsibility for enacting firearm policies increasingly falls on states instead of the federal government, this study provides valuable information that can assist states in making evidence based decisions regarding the development and implementation of firearm policies that prioritize public safety and aim to prevent firearm-related fatalities.

"objective interbody fusion is the primary method for achieving arthrodesis across the lumbosacral junction in the setting of degenerative pathologies, such as spondylosis and spondylolisthesis. two common techniques are anterior lumbar interbody fusion (alif) and posterior transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (tlif). in recent years, interbody design and technology have advanced, and most earlier studies comparing alif and tlif did not specifically assess the lumbosacral junction. this study compared changes in radiographic and clinical parameters between patients undergoing modern-era single-level alif and minimally invasive surgery (mis) tlif at l5-s1. methods consecutive patients who underwent single-segment l5-s1 alif or mis tlif performed by the senior authors over a 6-year interval (january 1, 2016-november 30, 2021) were retrospectively reviewed. upright radiographs were used to determine pre-and postoperative lumbar lordosis, segmental lordosis, disc angle, and neuroforaminal height. improvements in patient-reported outcome scores (oswestry disability index and sf-36) were also compared. results overall, 108 patients (58 [54%] men, 50 [46%] women; mean [sd] age 57.6 [13.5] years) were included in the study. alif was performed in 49 patients, and tlif was performed in 59 patients. the most common treatment indications were spondylolisthesis (50%, 54/108) and spondylosis (46%, 50/108). the cohorts did not differ in terms of intraoperative (p > 0.99) or postoperative (p = 0.73) complication rates. the mean (sd) hospital length of stay was significantly shorter for patients undergoing tlif than alif (1.3 [0.6] days vs 2.0 [1.4] days, p < 0.001). both techniques significantly improved l5-s1 segmental lordosis, disc angle, and neuroforaminal height (p <= 0.008). alif versus tlif significantly increased mean [sd] segmental lordosis (12.5 degrees [7.3 degrees] vs 2.0 degrees [5.7 degrees], p < 0.001), disc angle (14.8 degrees [5.5 degrees] vs 3.0 degrees [6.1 degrees], p < 0.001), and neuroforaminal height (4.5 [4.6] mm vs 2.4 [3.0] mm, p = 0.008). improvements in patient-reported outcome parameters and reoperation rates were similar between cohorts. conclusions when treating patients at a single segment across the lumbosacral junction, alif resulted in signifi- cantly greater increases in segmental lordosis, l5-s1 disc angle, and neuroforaminal height compared with mis tlif. improvements in clinical parameters and reoperation rates were similar between the 2 techniques. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2023.5.spine221224",AB_0595
