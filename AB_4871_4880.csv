"aerosol particle number concentration measurements are a crucial part of aerosol research. vertical profile measurements and high-altitude/low-pressure performance of the respective instruments become more important for remote sensing validation and a vital tool for the observation of climate variables. this study tests the new, commercially available water condensation particle counter (magic 210-lp) for the deployment at aircraft cruising pressure levels that the european research infrastructure iagos (in-service aircraft for a global observing system; http://www.iagos.org, last access: 2 may 2023) is aiming for by operating measurement instrumentation onboard passenger aircraft. we conducted laboratory experiments for conditions to simulate passenger aircraft flight altitude at operation pressure. we demonstrate that this type of water condensation particle counter shows excellent agreement with a butanol-based instrument used in parallel. a faraday cup aerosol electrometer serves as the reference instrument. experiments are performed with test aerosol ammonium sulfate and fresh combustion soot at pressure levels ranging from 700 to 200 hpa. for soluble particles like ammonium sulfate, the 50 % detection efficiency cut-off diameter (d50) is around 5 nm and does not differ significantly for all performed experiments. for non-soluble fresh soot particles, the d50 cut-off diameter of approximately 10 nm does not vary substantially as a function of pressure, whereas the 90 % detection efficiency cut-off diameter d90 increases from 19 nm at 700 hpa to 37 nm at 200 hpa. the overall counting efficiency for particles larger than 40 nm reaches 100 % for working pressures of 200 hpa and higher.",AB_0488
"estuarine dynamics are highly complex as a result of the temperature and salinity gradients, as well as the multiple interactions between atmospheric, maritime, and hydrological forcing agents. given the environmental and socioeconomic importance of estuaries and their current and future threats due to human interventions and climate change, it is of vital importance to characterize these dynamics, monitor their evolution, and quantify the expected impacts derived from climate change. this paper presents a hybrid database combining data obtained in six field surveys (in 2012, 2013, and 2015) and results from a physically based 3d numerical model for the bay of cadiz (southern spain), a highly anthropized mesotidal estuary. the 3d dataset includes water levels, currents, density, and wave climate, allowing for an analysis of bay dynamics at different timescales ranging from intratidal processes to seasonal variabilities. the results offer an example of the potential uses of the dataset and include (1) an assessment of the spatial and seasonal variability of the estuarine dynamics and (2) an analysis of the effects of severe weather events. these examples provide convincing evidence regarding how the dataset can be employed in multiple research fields and applications, including ocean-bay interactions, water exchange between basins, longwave and shortwave propagation along creek systems, and energy extraction of tidal waves. therefore, this hybrid dataset may be of significant interest for stakeholders and scientists from different sectors (water engineering, ecology, urban development, energy, etc.) working on the environmental management of the gulf of cadiz and other tidally dominated shallow bays. it can also serve as a benchmark test for numerical hydrodynamic models, infrastructure intervention assessments (e.g., dikes or breakwaters), or renewable energy conversion system models. the dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7484186 (zarzuelo et al., 2022b).",AB_0488
"background: the rapid expansion of whole-genome sequencing has revolutionized the fields of clinical and food microbiology. however, its implementation as a routine laboratory technique remains challenging due to the growth of data at a faster rate than can be effectively analyzed and critical gaps in bioinformatics knowledge. results: to address both issues, campype was developed as a new bioinformatics workflow for the genomics analysis of sequencing data of bacteria, especially campylobacter, which is the main cause of gastroenteritis worldwide making a negative impact on the economy of the public health systems. campype allows fully customization of stages to run and tools to use, including read quality control filtering, read contamination, reads extension and assembly, bacterial typing, genome annotation, searching for antibiotic resistance genes, virulence genes and plasmids, pangenome construction and identification of nucleotide variants. all results are processed and resumed in an interactive html report for best data visualization and interpretation. conclusions: the minimal user intervention of campype makes of this workflow an attractive resource for microbiology laboratories with no expertise in bioinformatics as a first line method for bacterial typing and epidemiological analyses, that would help to reduce the costs of disease outbreaks, or for comparative genomic analyses. campype is publicly available at https://github.com/josebarbero/campype.",AB_0488
"while the effect of missing audiences has been studied numerously in team sports with diverse effects, studies on individual performances are rare. the current investigation analyzes performances of professional dart players in (a) the absence of spectators, (b) the presence of real crowds, and (c) artificial crowd noise (simulated crowds) substituting live spectators during the covid-19 pandemic. empirical evidence suggests that performances in coordination-based accuracy tasks are negatively impacted by the presence of others. therefore, we hypothesize that performance of elite darts players deteriorates in the presence of a real audience (ra) in comparison to no audience (na) and simulated audience (sa). https://dartsorakel.com provided the data of professional tournaments played from 2018 to 2021, which included n=26,724 individual performances from k=442 players (98.8% male). how ra and sa impacted checkout percentage (cp) and three-dart average (3da) was analyzed using separate multilevel models, adding various control variables. competing with audiences (sa and ra) resulted in decreased cp with an effect of beta(stand_real)=-.20, p<.001, and beta(stand_sim)=-.14, p<.001. 3da increased with sa, beta(stand_sim)=.08, p<.001, and decreased with ra, beta(stand_sim)=-.07, p<.001. the results show that real crowds appear to have a negative impact on darts performance, yet effect sizes are small.",AB_0488
"functional enrichment analysis or gene set enrichment analysis is a basic bioinformatics method that evaluates the biological importance of a list of genes of interest. however, it may pro-duce a long list of significant terms with highly redundant information that is difficult to summarize. current tools to simplify enrichment results by clustering them into groups either still produce redundancy between clusters or do not retain consistent term similarities within clusters. we pro-pose a new method named binary cut for clustering similarity matrices of functional terms. through comprehensive benchmarks on both simulated and real-world datasets, we demonstrated that bi-nary cut could efficiently cluster functional terms into groups where terms showed consistent sim-ilarities within groups and were mutually exclusive between groups. we compared binary cut clustering on the similarity matrices obtained from different similarity measures and found that semantic similarity worked well with binary cut, while similarity matrices based on gene overlap showed less consistent patterns. we implemented the binary cut algorithm in the r package sim-plifyenrichment, which additionally provides functionalities for visualizing, summarizing, and com-paring the clustering. the simplifyenrichment package and the documentation are available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/simplifyenrichment/.",AB_0488
"background: cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)4/6-inhibitors with endocrine therapy represent the standard of treatment of hormone receptor-positive(hr+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2)-negative metastatic breast cancer (mbc). gut microbiota seems to predict treatment response in several tumour types, being directly implied in chemotherapy resistance and development of adverse effects. no evidence is available on gut microbiota impact on efficacy of hr+ breast cancer treatment. patients and methods: we assessed the potential association among faecal microbiota and therapeutic efficacy of cdk4/6-inhibitors on 14 mbc patients classified as responders and non-responders (nr) according to progression-free survival. a stool sample was collected at baseline and v3-v4 16s targeted sequencing was employed to assess its bacterial compo- sition. statistical associations with r and nr were studied. results: no significant differences were observed between r and nr in terms of & alpha;-/& beta;-di- versity at the phylum and species level. machine-learning (ml) algorithms evidenced four bacterial species as a discriminant for r (bifidobacterium longum, ruminococcus callidus) and nr (clostridium innocuum, schaalia odontolytica), and an area under curve (auc) 0.946 after random forest modelling. network analysis evidenced two major clusters bacterial species, named species interacting groups (sig)1-2, with sig1 harbouring 75% of nr-related bacterial species, and sig2 regrouping 76% of r-related species (p < 0.001). cross-correlations among several patients' circulating immune cells or biomarkers and bacterial species' relative abundances showed associations with potential prognostic plications. conclusions: our results provide initial insights into the gut microbiota involvement in sen- sitivity and/or resistance to cdk4/6-inhibitors + endocrine therapy in mbc. if confirmed larger trials, several microbiota manipulation strategies might be hypothesised to improve response to cdk4/6-inhibitors. data availability statement: all raw data (fastq.gz files) and clinical metadata, complying with fair principles (https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), are available at ncbi sra portal under prjna946762 bioproject. & copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc license ().",AB_0488

"monstrilloid copepods are protelean endoparasites of benthic invertebrates. their adult free-living stage is chiefly found in the plankton of shallow coastal systems, estuaries and coral reefs; there are no previous records of monstrilloids from deeper marine habitats including epipelagic or mesopelagic waters. two new species of the monstrilloid copepod genus cymbasoma thompson, 1888 are described based on adult females incidentally captured by an epibenthic sledge operated at a depth range of 118-302 m off north-west iceland and the norway channel. cymbasoma norvegicum sp. nov. is distinguished by a combination of characters including a long, constricted anal somite, bilobed fifth legs with long inner lobe, antennules with fused segments, and first antennule segment unarmed. cymbasoma pedroi sp. nov. has a pair of rounded posterolateral protuberances on the genital somite, fused fifth legs lobes, and an anteriorly produced, ornamented forehead. both species are considered new members of the cymbasoma rigidum species group, widely distributed in different geographic areas but not previously known from epi-mesopelagic depths. the finding of these new species represents the first discovery of monstrilloids at epi-mesopelagic depths in the pacific ocean and it significantly adds to our knowledge of this copepod order, thus highlighting their potentially high yet unstudied diversity in deeper waters.http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:c05eec28-9936-41cb-bc9e-d990ae53b3b1",AB_0488
"we present a long-term data set of 1 degrees x 1 degrees monthly mean total column water vapour (tcwv) based on global measurements of the ozone monitoring instrument (omi) covering the time range from january 2005 to december 2020. in comparison to the retrieval algorithm of borger et al. (2020), several modifications and filters have been applied accounting for instrumental issues (such as omi's row anomaly) or the inferior quality of solar reference spectra. for instance, to overcome issues related to low-quality reference spectra, the daily solar irradiance spectrum is replaced by an annually varying mean earthshine radiance obtained in december over antarctica. for the tcwv data set, we only consider measurements with an effective cloud fraction less than 20 %, an air mass factor (amf) greater than 0.1, a snow- and ice-free ground pixel, and an omi row that is not affected by the row anomaly over the complete time range of the data set. the individual tcwv measurements are then gridded to a regular 1 degrees x 1 degrees lattice, from which the monthly means are calculated. the investigation of sampling errors in the omi tcwv data set shows that these are dominated by the clear-sky bias and cause on average deviations of around 10 %, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies. however, the spatiotemporal sampling errors and those due to the row-anomaly filter are negligible. in a comprehensive intercomparison study, we demonstrate that the omi tcwv data set is in good agreement with the global reference data sets of era5 (fifth-generation ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis), rss ss-m/i (remote sensing systems special sensor microwave imager), and cm saf/cci tcwv-global (combi): over ocean the orthogonal distance regressions indicate slopes close to unity with very small offsets and high coefficients of determination of around 0.96. however, over land, distinctive positive deviations of more than +10 kg m(-2) are obtained for high tcwv values. these overestimations are mainly due to extreme overestimations of high tcwv values in the tropics, likely caused by uncertainties in the retrieval input data (surface albedo, cloud information) due to frequent cloud contamination in these regions. similar results are found from intercomparisons with in situ radiosonde measurements from version 2 of the integrated global radiosonde archive (igra2) data set. nevertheless, for tcwv values smaller than 25 kg m(-2), the omi tcwv data set shows very good agreement with the global reference data sets. furthermore, a temporal stability analysis proves that the omi tcwv data set is consistent with the temporal changes in the reference data sets and shows no significant deviation trends. as the tcwv retrieval can be easily applied to further satellite missions, additional tcwv data sets can be created from past missions, such as the global ozone monitoring experiment-1 (gome-1) or the scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric cartography (sciamachy); under consideration of systematic differences (e.g. due to different observation times), these data sets can be combined with the omi tcwv data set in order to create a data record that would cover a time span from 1995 to the present. moreover, the tcwv retrieval will also work for all missions dedicated to no2 in the future, such as sentinel-5 on metop-sg. the max planck institute for chemistry (mpic) omi total column water vapour (tcwv) climate data record (cdr) is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7973889 (borger et al., 2023).",AB_0488
"3d human pose estimation is a key component of clinical monitoring systems. the clinical applicability of deep pose estimation models, however, is limited by their poor generalization under domain shifts along with their need for sufficient labeled training data. as a remedy, we present a novel domain adaptation method, adapting a model from a labeled source to a shifted unlabeled target domain. our method comprises two complementary adaptation strategies based on prior knowledge about human anatomy. first, we guide the learning process in the target domain by constraining predictions to the space of anatomically plausible poses. to this end, we embed the prior knowledge into an anatomical loss function that penalizes asymmetric limb lengths, implausible bone lengths, and implausible joint angles. second, we propose to filter pseudo labels for self-training according to their anatomical plausibility and incorporate the concept into the mean teacher paradigm. we unify both strategies in a point cloud-based framework applicable to unsupervised and source free domain adaptation. evaluation is performed for in-bed pose estimation under two adaptation scenarios, using the public slp dataset and a newly created dataset. our method consistently outperforms various stateof-the-art domain adaptation methods, surpasses the baseline model by 31%/66%, and reduces the domain gap by 65%/82%. source code is available at https://github.com/multimodallearning/da-3dhpe-anatomy.",AB_0488
