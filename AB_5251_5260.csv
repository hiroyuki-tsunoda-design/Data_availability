"anticancer peptides (acps) are the types of peptides that have been demonstrated to have anticancer activities. using acps to prevent cancer could be a viable alternative to conventional cancer treatments because they are safer and display higher selectivity. due to acp identification being highly lab-limited, expensive and lengthy, a computational method is proposed to predict acps from sequence information in this study. the process includes the input of the peptide sequences, feature extraction in terms of ordinal encoding with positional information and handcrafted features, and finally feature selection. the whole model comprises of two modules, including deep learning and machine learning algorithms. the deep learning module contained two channels: bidirectional long short-term memory (bilstm) and convolutional neural network (cnn). light gradient boosting machine (lightgbm) was used in the machine learning module. finally, this study voted the three models' classification results for the three paths resulting in the model ensemble layer. this study provides insights into acp prediction utilizing a novel method and presented a promising performance. it used a benchmark dataset for further exploration and improvement compared with previous studies. our final model has an accuracy of 0.7895, sensitivity of 0.8153 and specificity of 0.7676, and it was increased by at least 2% compared with the state-of-the-art studies in all metrics. hence, this paper presents a novel method that can potentially predict acps more effectively and efficiently. the work and source codes are made available to the community of researchers and developers at https://github.com/khanhlee/acp-ope/.",AB_0526
"research highlight: delhey, k., valcu, m., dale, j., & kempenaers, b. (2022). the evolution of carotenoid- based plumage colours in passerine birds. journal of animal ecology, https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13791. carotenoids, a class of colour pigments, are responsible for red, yellow and orange hues in nature. they play an important role in visual animals, and specially birds, where dietary carotenoids can act as honest sexual signals. long-standing interest in the function of carotenoid- based colours has led to different hypotheses for their evolutionary drivers. yet, comparative studies testing the generality of these hypotheses have been previously limited in phylogenetic scope or resolution. in a recent study, delhey et al. (2022) combined sexual dichromatism, life history and environmental data to investigate the evolution of carotenoid- based colouration in the largest avian radiation, the passerines (order: passeriformes). the authors show that the expression of carotenoid- based colours depends on environmental availability, dietary content and body size. they also show that red carotenoids are more often evolutionarily and metabolically derived, and suggest different colours are favoured by natural and sexual selection. these findings shine new light on commonly held hypotheses of carotenoid-colour evolution and contribute to our understanding of how phenotypic diversity evolves.",AB_0526
"background: endoluminal surgery for the management of rectal prolapse remains largely experimental. objective: to evaluate the evolution and short-term outcomes of a new endoluminal technique for the management of complete rectal prolapse. design: this was a prospective study. settings: this study was conducted at a single tertiary care teaching center. patients: a total of 29 patients were included. the first 12 patients underwent the procedure with our initial technique, and the last 17 patients were subjected to the new modified procedure. the follow-up duration was 3 years for the older technique and 26 months for the newer technique. intervention: this technique involves: 1) ventral suture rectopexy: rectum is fixed anteriorly to the anterior abdominal wall using percutaneously placed sutures. 2) posterior rectum is fixed to the sacral promontory using tackers through a submucosal tunnel. main outcome measures: safety, recurrence, functional outcomes, morbidity, and mortality were the main outcome measures. results: there were improvements in constipation and incontinence scores, anal manometric pressures, anorectal angle, anorectal descent, and quality of life postoperatively in both groups. in patients undergoing the modified procedure, there was a significant decrease in duration of surgery (220 +/- 48.89 vs 110 +/- 12.51 min), shortened hospital stay (4.6 +/- 1.71 vs 2.6 +/- 0.65 d), decreased recurrence (25% vs 5.8%), and complications (surgical-site infection and retrorectal abscess). limitations: short follow-up, small sample size, and single-center study were the limitations. conclusion: this is a novel endoluminal technique for treating rectal prolapse obviating perirectal dissection, abdominal incisions, or a mesh. this can now be performed under complete endoscopic and fluoroscopic vision. it avoids general anesthesia and therefore can be an alternative for patients with comorbid conditions in whom the standard abdominal procedure may not be well tolerated. larger randomized multicentric studies with longer follow-ups are warranted. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c59.",AB_0526
"background: the findings from randomized clinical trials (rcts) examining the effect of magnesium supplementation on depression are inconsistent. we decided to conduct a meta-analysis that summarizes all the evidence on the impact of magnesium supplementation on depression scores in adults with depressive disorder.methods: we conducted a systematic search in the online databases using all related keywords up to july 2023. we included all randomized clinical trials examining the effect of magnesium, in contrast to placebo, on depression scores.results: finally, seven clinical trials were included in this systematic review, building up a total sample size of 325 individuals with ages ranging from 20 to 60 years on average. these rcts resulted in eight effect sizes. our findings from the meta-analysis showed a significant decline in depression scores due to intervention with magnesium supplements [standardized mean difference (smd): -0.919, 95% ci: -1.443 to -0.396, p = 0.001].conclusion: our review suggests that magnesium supplementation can have a beneficial effect on depression. future high-quality rcts with larger sample sizes must be run to interpret this effect of magnesium on depression in clinical settings.systematic review registration https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?recordid=447909.",AB_0526
"motivation t cells play an essential role in adaptive immune system to fight pathogens and cancer but may also give rise to autoimmune diseases. the recognition of a peptide-mhc (pmhc) complex by a t cell receptor (tcr) is required to elicit an immune response. many machine learning models have been developed to predict the binding, but generalizing predictions to pmhcs outside the training data remains challenging.results we have developed a new machine learning model that utilizes information about the tcr from both alpha and beta chains, epitope sequence, and mhc. our method uses protbert embeddings for the amino acid sequences of both chains and the epitope, as well as convolution and multi-head attention architectures. we show the importance of each input feature as well as the benefit of including epitopes with only a few tcrs to the training data. we evaluate our model on existing databases and show that it compares favorably against other state-of-the-art models.availability and implementation https://github.com/danitheorange/epic-trace.",AB_0526
"automatic biomedical relation extraction (biore) is an essential task in biomedical research in order to generate high-quality labelled data that can be used for the development of innovative predictive methods. however, building such fully labelled, high quality biore data sets of adequate size for the training of state-of-the-art relation extraction models is hindered by an annotation bottleneck due to limitations on time and expertise of researchers and curators. we show here how active learning (al) plays an important role in resolving this issue and positively improve biore tasks, effectively overcoming the labelling limits inherent to a data set. six different al strategies are benchmarked on seven biore data sets, using pubmedbert as the base model, evaluating their area under the learning curve (aulc) as well as intermediate results measurements. the results demonstrate that uncertainty-based strategies, such as least-confident or margin sampling, are statistically performing better in terms of f1-score, accuracy and precision, than other types of al strategies. however, in terms of recall, a diversity-based strategy, called core-set, outperforms all strategies. al strategies are shown to reduce the annotation need (in order to reach a performance at par with training on all data), from 6% to 38%, depending on the data set; with margin sampling and least-confident sampling strategies moreover obtaining the best aulcs compared to the random sampling baseline. we show through the experiments the importance of using al methods to reduce the amount of labelling needed to construct high-quality data sets leading to optimal performance of deep learning models. the code and data sets to reproduce all the results presented in the article are available at https://github.com/oligogenic/deep_active_learning_biore.",AB_0526
"one of the challenges in multi-omics data analysis for precision medicine is the efficient exploration of undiscovered molecular interactions in disease processes. we present biomobs, a workflow consisting of two data visualization tools integrated with an open-source molecular information database to perform clinically relevant analyses (https://github.com/driesheylen123/biomobs). we performed exploratory pathway analysis with biomobs and demonstrate its ability to generate relevant molecular hypotheses, by reproducing recent findings in type 2 diabetes uk biobank data. the central visualisation tool, where data-driven and literature-based findings can be integrated, is available within the github link as well. biomobs is a workflow that leverages information from multiple data-driven interactive analyses and visually integrates it with established pathway knowledge. the demonstrated use cases place trust in the usage of biomobs as a procedure to offer clinically relevant insights in disease pathway analyses on various types of omics data.",AB_0526
"the present paper reports an independent and better powered (n = 847 vs. n = 85) replication of experiment 3 in glikson et al. (2018). the authors of the original study reported support for their proposition that due to perceptions of (in)appropriateness, the use of smileys may backfire and produce less favorable perceptions of competence in a formal work-related setting, yet more favorable perceptions of warmth in an informal work-related setting. our results, in contrast, indicated that smileys produce a negative effect on perceptions of competence and a positive effect on perceptions of warmth, regardless of the level of formality. moreover, our results did not support the reported moderated mediation model involving perceptions of appropriateness. potential explanations for the discrepancies in results are discussed. we provide data, code, and materials on https://osf.io/n7yc4/.",AB_0526
"convolutional neural networks (cnns) have demonstrated encouraging results in image classification tasks. however, the prohibitive computational cost of cnns hinders the deployment of cnns onto resource-constrained embedded devices. to address this issue, we propose edgecompress, a comprehensive compression framework to reduce the computational overhead of cnns. in edgecompress, we first introduce dynamic image cropping (dic), where we design a lightweight foreground predictor to accurately crop the most informative foreground object of input images for inference, which avoids redundant computation on background regions. subsequently, we present compound shrinking (cs) to collaboratively compress the three dimensions (depth, width, and resolution) of cnns according to their contribution to accuracy and model computation. dic and cs together constitute a multidimensional cnn compression framework, which is able to comprehensively reduce the computational redundancy in both input images and neural network architectures, thereby improving the inference efficiency of cnns. further, we present a dynamic inference framework to efficiently process input images with different recognition difficulties, where we cascade multiple models with different complexities from our compression framework and dynamically adopt different models for different input images, which further compresses the computational redundancy and improves the inference efficiency of cnns, facilitating the deployment of advanced cnns onto embedded hardware. experiments on imagenet-1k demonstrate that edgecompress reduces the computation of resnet-50 by 48.8% while improving the top-1 accuracy by 0.8%. meanwhile, we improve the accuracy by 4.1% with similar computation compared to hrank. the state-of-the-art compression framework. the source code and models are available at https://github.com/ntuliuteam/edge-compress.",AB_0526
"backgroundadjustment problems and disorders are highly prevalent among university students worldwide. these problems can cause significant interference in academic and social functioning and increase vulnerability to other mental health disorders. unfortunately, only half of students in need receive psychological help. furthermore, few studies have evaluated psychological interventions for adjustment disorders in students. new, more scalable forms of treatment for students with an adjustment disorder need to be developed, evaluated, and implemented. the study aims to determine the effectiveness of an online transdiagnostic cognitive behavioural intervention for students experiencing adjustment disorder and to assess mediators of change.method/designin this three-arm randomized controlled trial, we plan to recruit 214 polish students diagnosed with an adjustment disorder. participants who meet initial eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to one of three 6-week conditions: (1) online cognitive behavioural therapy intervention based on an existing, empirically supported transdiagnostic protocol, the unified protocol; (2) online progressive muscle relaxation training as an active control group; or (3) waiting-list control group. both interventions are asynchronous, interactive, and include minimal amount of therapist support. assessments will consist of self-report questionnaires, daily diary measures, and neurocognitive tasks for evaluating cognitive functioning. these will be conducted at baseline, post-treatment, and 1-month follow-up. daily diary measures will be taken during the first and last week of treatment (or waitlist period). primary outcome measures will include adjustment disorder severity; secondary outcome measures will consist of other negative (psychopathology: depression, anxiety, and stress) and positive (life satisfaction) indexes of mental health as well as process measures (e.g. mindfulness, experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion).discussionto our knowledge, the current study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a psychological intervention for students with adjustment disorder. therefore, it may have important practical implications for students with this disorder. it can potentially guide the development of a scalable, validated treatment option.trial registrationclinical trials, nct05768308, registered 14 march 2023, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct05768308",AB_0526
