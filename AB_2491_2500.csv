"person re-identification (reid) aims to match a specific person across non-overlapping camera views and has wide application prospects. however, existing methods are still susceptible to occlusion and missing critical parts. most methods fuse low-level detail features and high-level strong semantic features using feature concatenation or addition, leading to useful information being overwhelmed by a large amount of useless information. in addition, many methods extract spatial context features by designing different blocks but ignore the local channel context features. to relieve these issues, this paper presents an improved interaction-and-aggregation network (iianet) to learn more representative feature representation. first, to improve model robustness to serious occlusion or missing crucial parts of the target person, we employ a global multi-scale module (msm) to extract multi-scale features by multi-branch convolution and hierarchical residual connection. second, to selectively fuse low-level detail features and high-level semantic features effectively, we design a gated fully fusion module (gffm) to control information transmission and reduce feature interferences in fusing different-level features. finally, we adopt a channel context module (ccm) to learn channel context information via multi-scale local fusion. sufficient experiments demonstrate the better performances of our iianet on dataset market-1501. the map and rank-1 accuracy of our model reach 84.9% and 94.2%, respectively. our code is available at: https://gitee.com/bingsfan/iianet/tree/master/",AB_0250
"background alternative splicing (as) is a co-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of plants in response to environmental stress. however, the role of as in biotic and abiotic stress responses remains largely unknown. to speed up our understanding of plant as patterns under different stress responses, development of informative and comprehensive plant as databases is highly demanded. description in this study, we first collected 3,255 rna-seq data under biotic and abiotic stresses from two important model plants (arabidopsis and rice). then, we conducted as event detection and gene expression analysis, and established a user-friendly plant as database termed plaasdb. by using representative samples from this highly integrated database resource, we compared as patterns between arabidopsis and rice under abiotic and biotic stresses, and further investigated the corresponding difference between as and gene expression. specifically, we found that differentially spliced genes (dsgs) and differentially expressed genes (deg) share very limited overlapping under all kinds of stresses, suggesting that gene expression regulation and as seemed to play independent roles in response to stresses. compared with gene expression, arabidopsis and rice were more inclined to have conserved as patterns under stress conditions. conclusion plaasdb is a comprehensive plant-specific as database that mainly integrates the as and gene expression data of arabidopsis and rice in stress response. through large-scale comparative analyses, the global landscape of as events in arabidopsis and rice was observed. we believe that plaasdb could help researchers understand the regulatory mechanisms of as in plants under stresses more conveniently. plaasdb is freely accessible at http://zzdlab. com/plaasdb/asdb/index. html.",AB_0250
"cyclic amp receptor proteins (crps) are important transcription regulators in many species. the prediction of crp-binding sites was mainly based on position-weighted matrixes (pwms). traditional prediction methods only considered known binding motifs, and their ability to discover inflexible binding patterns was limited. thus, a novel crp-binding site prediction model called crpbsfinder was developed in this research, which combined the hidden markov model, knowledge-based pwms and structure-based binding affinity matrixes. we trained this model using validated crp-binding data from escherichia coli and evaluated it with computational and experimental methods. the result shows that the model not only can provide higher prediction performance than a classic method but also quantitatively indicates the binding affinity of transcription factor binding sites by prediction scores. the prediction result included not only the most knowns regulated genes but also 1089 novel crp-regulated genes. the major regulatory roles of crps were divided into four classes: carbohydrate metabolism, organic acid metabolism, nitrogen compound metabolism and cellular transport. several novel functions were also discovered, including heterocycle metabolic and response to stimulus. based on the functional similarity of homologous crps, we applied the model to 35 other species. the prediction tool and the prediction results are online and are available at: https://awi.cuhk.edu.cn/similar to crpbsfinder.",AB_0250
"background foxtail millet (setaria italica) harbors the small diploid genome (similar to 450 mb) and shows the high inbreed-ing rate and close relationship to several major foods, feed, fuel and bioenergy grasses. previously, we created a mini foxtail millet, xiaomi, with an arabidopsis-like life cycle. the de novo assembled genome data with high-quality and an efficient agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation system made xiaomi an ideal c-4 model system. the mini foxtail millet has been widely shared in the research community and as a result there is a growing need for a user-friendly portal and intuitive interface to perform exploratory analysis of the data. results here, we built a multi-omics database for setaria italica (mdsi, http://sky.sxau.edu.cn/mdsi.htm), that contains xiaomi genome of 161,844 annotations, 34,436 protein-coding genes and their expression information in 29 different tissues ofxiaomi (6) and jg21 (23) samples that can be showed as an electronic fluorescent pictograph (xefp) in-situ. moreover, the whole-genome resequencing (wgs) data of 398 germplasms, including 360 foxtail millets and 38 green foxtails and the corresponding metabolic data were available in mdsi. the snps and indels of these germ-plasms were called in advance and can be searched and compared in an interactive manner. common tools including blast, gbrowse, jbrowse, map viewer, and data downloads were implemented in mdsi. conclusion the mdsi constructed in this study integrated and visualized data from three levels of genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics, and also provides information on the variation of hundreds of germplasm resources that can satisfies the mainstream requirements and supports the corresponding research community.",AB_0250
"background: difficult airway conditions represent a substantial challenge for clinicians. predicting such conditions is essential for subsequent treatment planning, but the reported diagnostic accuracies are still quite low. to overcome these challenges, we developed a rapid, non-invasive, cost-effective, and highly-accurate deep-learning approach to identify difficult airway conditions through photographic image analysis.methods: for each of 1000 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia, images were captured from 9 specific and different viewpoints. the collected image set was divided into training and testing subsets in the ratio of 8:2. we used a semi-supervised deep-learning method to train and test an ai model for difficult airway prediction.results: we trained our semi-supervised deep-learning model using only 30% of the labeled training samples (with the remaining 70% used without labels). we evaluated the model performance using metrics of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, f1-score, and the area under the roc curve (auc). the numerical values of these four metrics were found to be 90.00%, 89.58%, 90.13%, 81.13%, and 0.9435, respectively. for a fully-supervised learning scheme (with 100% of the labeled training samples used for model training), the corresponding values were 90.50%, 91.67%, 90.13%, 82.25%, and 0.9457, respectively. when three professional anesthesiologists conducted comprehensive evaluation, the corresponding results were 91.00%, 91.67%, 90.79%, 83.26%, and 0.9497, respectively. it can be seen that the semi-supervised deep learning model trained by us with only 30% labeled samples can achieve a comparable effect with the fully supervised learning model, but the sample labeling cost is smaller. our method can achieve a good balance between performance and cost. at the same time, the results of the semi-supervised model trained with only 30% labeled samples were very close to the performance of human experts.conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first one to apply a semi-supervised deep-learning method in order to identify the difficulties of both mask ventilation and intubation. our ai-based image analysis system can be used as an effective tool to identify patients with difficult airway conditions.clinical trial registration: chictr2100049879 (url: http://www.chictr.org.cn).",AB_0250
"background and objective: quantitative analysis of choroidal vessels is important for the diagnosis of choroidal related diseases and the cognition of the choroid. previous studies focused on segmenting choroidal vessels in enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (oct) and swept-source oct modalities. there is still a blank for the segmentation of 3d choroidal vessels in the spectral-domain oct (sd-oct) modality. quantitative analysis of choroidal vessels is crucial for diagnosing choroidal-related diseases and understanding the choroid. previous studies have focused on segmenting choroidal vessels in enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (oct) and swept-source oct modalities. there is still a gap in the segmentation of 3d choroidal vessels in the spectral-domain oct (sd-oct) modality. method: we propose a novel 3d cnn-based method, called shape-aware adversarial networks (san), for segmenting choroidal vessels in sd-oct images. to learn the 3d mapping of sd-oct images and labels, we built a 3d u-shape network backbone with anisotropic down-sampling and up-sampling operations. to learn the morphological characteristics of choroidal vessels, we constructed an auxiliary output branch to predict a newly designed choroidal vessel shape representation generated by labels. we further introduced a label-conditional adversarial loss to enforce shape learning in a patch-based pipeline. the code for san is publicly available at: https://github.com/nicetomeetu21/san. results: the effectiveness of san has been verified in data with myopia. the proposed model reported as measures of segmentation performance a mean dice similarity coefficient of 85.96% and a mean hausdorff distance of 2.54, outperforming other 2d and 3d segmentation methods. we further applied our method in the statistical analysis of the choroidal feature between 100 eyes with low to moderate myopia and 108 eyes with high myopia. the results show that in all early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study subfields, the choroid volumes and vascular volumes of the two groups are significantly different (< 0.01). the choroidal vascular indexes (cvi) of two groups are significantly different in most subfields (< 0.01) except for central and nasal inner subfields. the cvi of the high myopia group is higher than that of the low to moderate myopia group in most subfields except for the nasal inner subfield. conclusions: the results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately segment choroidal vessels from sd-oct volumes. the quantitative analysis of choroidal biomarkers in a total of 208 myopia eyes shows the applicability of the proposed method in helping to study the choroid.",AB_0250
"hematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide images (wsis) are the gold standard for pathologists and medical professionals for tumor diagnosis, surgery planning, and postoperative examinations. in recent years, due to the rapidly emerging field of deep learning, there have been many convolutional neural networks (cnns) and transformer based models applied to computational pathology for accurate segmentation. however, the generalization ability and robustness of models often affect the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer, and we attempt to effectively combine the advantage of cnn which excels in sparse wsi segmentation while transformer excels in dense cases. in this paper, we propose a novel feature fusion strategy, dhunet, which utilizes swin transformer and convnext modules with a dual-branch hierarchical u-shaped architecture to fuse global and local features for wsi segmentation. firstly, a wsi is divided into small patches, which are put into the global and local encoders to generate hierarchical features in parallel. then, with the help of global-local fusion modules and skip connections, the decoder can fully obtain the global coarse and local fine-grained information during the upsampling process. the proposed cross-scale expand layer can make the patches with the same center but different scales recover the input resolution gradually at each stage. finally, all the projected pixel-level patch masks are merged to restore the final wsi tumor segmentation. extensive experiments demonstrate that dhunet has excellent performance and generalization ability for wsi segmentation, achieving the best segmentation results on three datasets with different types of cancer, densities, and target sizes. the code and pre-processed datasets will be publicly available at https://github.com/pengsl-lab/dhunet.",AB_0250
"in recent years, there have been several solutions to medical image segmentation, such as u-shaped structure, transformer-based network, and multi-scale feature learning method. however, their network parameters and real-time performance are often neglected and cannot segment boundary regions well. the main reason is that such networks have deep encoders, a large number of channels, and excessive attention to local information rather than global information, which is crucial to the accuracy of image segmentation. therefore, we propose a novel multi-branch medical image segmentation network mbsnet. we first design two branches using a parallel residual mixer (prm) module and dilate convolution block to capture the local and global information of the image. at the same time, a se-block and a new spatial attention module enhance the output features. considering the different output features of the two branches, we adopt a cross-fusion method to effectively combine and complement the features between different layers. mbsnet was tested on five datasets isic2018, kvasir, busi, covid-19, and lgg. the combined results show that mbsnet is lighter, faster, and more accurate. specifically, for a 320 x 320 input, mbsnet's flops is 10.68g, with an f1-score of 85.29% on the kvasir test dataset, well above 78.73% for unet++ with flops of 216.55g. we also use the multi-criteria decision making method topsis based on f1-score, iou and geometric-mean (g-mean) for overall analysis. the proposed mbsnet model performs better than other competitive methods. code is available at https://github.com/yulionel/mbsnet.",AB_0250
"in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-em) single particle analysis (spa), high-resolution three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules are determined by iteratively aligning and averaging a large number of two-dimensional projections of molecules. since the correlation measures are sensitive to the signal-to-noise ratio, various parameter estimation steps in spa will be disturbed by the high-intensity noise in cryo-em. however, denoising algorithms tend to damage high frequencies and suppress mid- and high-frequency contrast of micrographs, which exactly the precise parameter estimation relies on, therefore, limiting their application in spa. in this study, we suggest combining a cryo-em image processing pipeline with denoising and maximizing the signal's contribution in various parameter estimation steps. to solve the inherent flaws of denoising algorithms, we design an algorithm named mscale to correct the amplitude distortion caused by denoising and propose a new orientation determination strategy to compensate for the high-frequency loss. in the experiments on several real datasets, the denoised particles are successfully applied in the class assignment estimation and orientation determination tasks, ultimately enhancing the quality of biomacromolecule reconstruction. the case study on classification indicates that our strategy not only improves the resolution of difficult classes (up to 5 angstrom) but also resolves an additional class. in the case study on orientation determination, our strategy improves the resolution of the final reconstructed density map by 0.34 angstrom compared with conventional strategy. the code is available at https://github.com/zhanghui186/mscale.",AB_0250
"background & aims: it is unclear whether vitamin d supplementation contributes to gestational glucose control and whether the specific effects vary in individuals with diverse genetic and metabolic contexts. the study aimed to assess the effect of vitamin d supplementation during pregnancy on subsequent glucose levels and to identify factors modulating the response to vitamin d3 intake. methods: we conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial, 1720 pregnant women recruited from the three antenatal clinics of hefei city, china, who were allocated to receive either 1600 iu/d vitamin d3 (n = 858) or 400 iu/d vitamin d3 (n = 862) for 2 months at 24-28 weeks' gestation. outcomes were changes in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d (25(oh)d) and fasting plasma glucose (fpg) levels from baseline, 32-36 weeks' gestation to delivery (37-41 weeks) quantified using a linear mixed model. results: after 2 months, fpg levels of the control group significantly increased by 0.22 mmol/l (from 4.6 [0.4] mmol/l to 4.8 [1.2] mmol/l, p < 0.001) at delivery, but that of the intervention group had no significant variation (from 4.6 [0.4] mmol/l to 4.7 [1.1] mmol/l; between-group difference in changes,-0.2 mmol/l, 95% ci,-0.3 to-0.08, p = 0.015). and differences in fpg variation were found in participants with the apai snp cc genotype, or bsmi-cc, taqi-aa, foki-aa, respectively. pregnant women with basal 25(oh)d con-centrations higher than 50 nmol/l subgroup showed the greatest decline in fpg levels (between-group difference,-0.3 mmol/l; 95% ci,-0.5 to-0.1, p < 0.001). moreover, pregnant women with gdm, multiple pregnancies or who were overweight were more likely to have fpg decline from vitamin d treatment. conclusions: vitamin d supplementation significantly protected glucose homeostasis in mid-late gestation, and glycemic response to vitamin d may be dependent on basal 25(oh)d status, vdr gene polymorphism or their metabolic profiles. trial registration number: chictr2100051914. url of registration: http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=134700.
