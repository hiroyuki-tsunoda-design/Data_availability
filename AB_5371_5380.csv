"customer satisfaction is crucially affected by energy consumption in mobile devices. one of the most energy-consuming parts of an application is images. this paper, first, investigates that there is a correlation between energy consumption and image quality as well as image file size. therefore, these two can be considered as a proxy for energy consumption. in the next step, we focused on proposing a multi-objective strategy to enhance image quality and reduce image file size based on the quantisation table (qt) in jpeg image compression. to this end, we have used two general multi-objective approaches: scalarisation and pareto-based. in this paper, we embed our strategy into five scalarisation algorithms, including energy-aware multi-objective genetic algorithm (enmoga), energy-aware multi-objective particle swarm optimisation (enmopso), energy-aware multi-objective differential evolution (enmode), energy-aware multi-objective evolutionary strategy (enmoes), and energy-aware multi-objective pattern search (enmops). also, two pareto-based methods, including a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (nsga-ii) and a reference-point-based nsga-ii (nsga-iii) are used for the embedding scheme, and two pareto-based algorithms, ennsgaii and ennsgaiii, are presented. with our proposed scalarisation method, user's preferences can be set before starting the optimisation process and the algorithm generates only one solution based on the preference, while our pareto-based approaches generate a set of solutions so that a user can select one of the preferred solutions after the optimisation process. experimental studies show that the performance of the baseline algorithm is improved by em-bedding the proposed strategy into metaheuristic algorithms. in particular, enmoga, enmops, and ennsga-ii can perform competitively, among others. from the results, the baseline algorithm in all cases and in comparison to all algorithms yields the worst results. among the scalarisation methods, enmoga and enmops can achieve the first rank in 6 and 7 out of 13 cases and the second rank in 7 and 5 cases in terms of objective function. also, enmoes achieved the fifth or worst rank among the scalarisation algorithms. regarding the pareto-based algorithms, the table shows that ennsgaii outperforms ennsgaiii in 10 out of 13 cases in terms of hyper-volume measure, while it fails in 3 cases. furthermore, we statistically verify the proposed algorithm's effectiveness based on the wilcoxon-signed rank test. finally, a sensitivity analysis of the parameters is provided. the source code for reproducing the results is available in: https://github.com/seyedjalaleddinmousavirad/ multiobjectivejpegimagecompression.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0538
"motivation: relation extraction (re) is a crucial process to deal with the amount of text published daily, e.g. to find missing associations in a database. re is a text mining task for which the state-of-the-art approaches use bidirectional encoders, namely, bert. however, state-of-the-art performance may be limited by the lack of efficient external knowledge injection approaches, with a larger impact in the biomedical area given the widespread usage and high quality of biomedical ontologies. this knowledge can propel these systems forward by aiding them in predicting more explainable biomedical associations. with this in mind, we developed k-ret, a novel, knowledgeable biomedical re system that, for the first time, injects knowledge by handling different types of associations, multiple sources and where to apply it, and multi-token entities. results: we tested k-ret on three independent and open-access corpora (ddi, bc5cdr, and pgr) using four biomedical ontologies handling different entities. k-ret improved state-of-the-art results by 2.68% on average, with the ddi corpus yielding the most significant boost in performance, from 79.30% to 87.19% in f-measure, representing a p-value of 2:91 x 10(-12). availability and implementation: https://github.com/lasigebiotm/k-ret.",AB_0538
"wi-fi sensing technology has shown superiority in smart homes among various sensors for its cost-effective and privacy-preserving merits. it is empowered by channel state information (csi) extracted from wi-fi signals and advanced machine learning models to analyze motion patterns in csi. many learning-based models have been proposed for kinds of applications, but they severely suffer from environmental dependency. though domain adaptation methods have been proposed to tackle this issue, it is not practical to collect high-quality, well-segmented, and balanced csi samples in a new environment for adaptation algorithms, but randomly captured csi samples can be easily collected. in this article, we first explore how to learn a robust model from these low-quality csi samples, and propose autofi, an annotation-efficient wi-fi sensing model based on a novel geometric self-supervised learning algorithm. the autofi fully utilizes unlabeled low-quality csi samples that are captured randomly, and then transfers the knowledge to specific tasks defined by users, which is the first work to achieve cross-task transfer in wi-fi sensing. the autofi is implemented on a pair of atheros wi-fi aps for evaluation. the autofi transfers knowledge from randomly collected csi samples into human gait recognition and achieves state-of-the-art performance. furthermore, we simulate cross-task transfer using public data sets to further demonstrate its capacity for cross-task learning. for the ut-har and widar data sets, the autofi achieves satisfactory results on activity recognition and gesture recognition without any prior training. we believe that autofi takes a huge step toward automatic wi-fi sensing without any developer engagement. our codes have been included in https://github.com/xyanchen/wi-fi-csi-sensing-benchmark.",AB_0538
"aim: to develop models that predict the presence of medication errors (mes) (prescription, preparation, administration, and monitoring) using machine learning in nicu patients.design: prospective, observational cohort study randomized with machine learning (ml) algorithms.setting: a 22-bed capacity nicu in ankara, turkey, between february 2020 and july 2021.results: a total of 11,908 medication orders (28.9 orders/patient) for 412 nicu patients (5.53 drugs/patient/day) who received 2,280 prescriptions over 32,925 patient days were analyzed. at least one physician-related me and nurse-related me were found in 174 (42.2%) and 235 (57.0%) of the patients, respectively. the parameters that had the highest correlation with me occurrence and subsequently included in the model were: total number of drugs, anti-infective drugs, nervous system drugs, 5-min apgar score, postnatal age, alimentary tract and metabolism drugs, and respiratory system drugs as patient-related parameters, and weekly working hours of nurses, weekly working hours of physicians, and number of nurses' monthly shifts as care provider-related parameters. the obtained model showed high performance to predict me (auc: 0.920; 95% ci: 0.876-0.970) presence and is accessible online (http://softmed.hacettepe.edu.tr/neodeer_medication_error/).conclusion: this is the first developed and validated model to predict the presence of me using work environment and pharmacotherapy parameters with high-performance ml algorithms in nicu patients. this approach and the current model hold the promise of implementation of targeted/precision screening to prevent mes in neonates.",AB_0538
"data simulation is fundamental for machine learning and causal inference, as it allows exploration of scenarios and assessment of methods in settings with full control of ground truth. directed acyclic graphs (dags) are well established for encoding the dependence structure over a collection of variables in both inference and simulation settings. however, while modern machine learning is applied to data of an increasingly complex nature, dagbased simulation frameworks are still confined to settings with relatively simple variable types and functional forms. we here present dagsim, a python-based framework for dagbased data simulation without any constraints on variable types or functional relations. a succinct yaml format for defining the simulation model structure promotes transparency, while separate user-provided functions for generating each variable based on its parents ensure simulation code modularization. we illustrate the capabilities of dagsim through use cases where metadata variables control shapes in an image and patterns in bio-sequences. dagsim is available as a python package at pypi. source code and documentation are available at: https://github.com/uio-bmi/dagsim",AB_0538
"molecular property prediction is an essential task in drug discovery. recently, deep neural networks have accelerated the discovery of compounds with improved molecular profiles for effective drug development. in particular, graph neural networks (gnns) have played a pivotal role in identifying promising drug candidates with desirable molecular properties. however, it is common for only a few molecules to share the same set of properties, which presents a low-data problem unanswered by regular machine learning (ml) approaches. transformer networks have also emerged as a promising solution to model the long-range dependence in molecular embeddings and achieve encouraging results across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks. nonetheless, these methods still require a large number of data points per task to achieve acceptable performance. in this study, we propose a few-shot gnn-transformer architecture, fs-gnntr to face the challenge of low-data in molecular property prediction. the proposed model accepts molecules in the form of molecular graphs to model the local spatial context of molecular graph embeddings while preserving the global information of deep representations. furthermore, we introduce a two-module meta-learning framework to iteratively update model parameters across few-shot tasks and predict new molecular properties with limited available data. finally, we conduct multiple experiments on small-sized biological datasets for molecular property prediction, tox21 and sider, and our results demonstrate the superior performance of fs-gnntr compared to simpler graph-based baselines. the code and data underlying this article are available in the repository, https://github.com/ltorres97/fs-gnntr.",AB_0538
"background: microbial culture collections play a key role in taxonomy by studying the diversity of their strains and providing well-characterized biological material to the scientific community for fundamental and applied research. these microbial resource centers thus need to implement new standards in species delineation, including whole-genome sequencing and phylogenomics. in this context, the genomic needs of the belgian coordinated collections of microorganisms were studied, resulting in the gen-era toolbox. the latter is a unified cluster of bioinformatic workflows dedicated to both bacteria and small eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts). findings: this public toolbox allows researchers without a specific training in bioinformatics to perform robust phylogenomic analyses. hence, it facilitates all steps from genome downloading and quality assessment, including genomic contamination estimation, to tree reconstruction. it also offers workflows for average nucleotide identity comparisons and metabolic modeling. technical details: nextflow workflows are launched by a single command and are available on the gen-era github repository (https://github.com/lcornet/genera). all the workflows are based on singularity containers to increase reproducibility. testing: the toolbox was developed for a diversity of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. it was further tested on an empirical dataset of 18 (meta)genomes of early branching cyanobacteria, providing the most up-to-date phylogenomic analysis of the gloeobacterales order, the first group to diverge in the evolutionary tree of cyanobacteria. conclusion: the gen-era toolbox can be used to infer completely reproducible comparative genomic and metabolic analyses on prokaryotes and small eukaryotes. although designed for routine bioinformatics of culture collections, it can also be used by all researchers interested in microbial taxonomy, as exemplified by our case study on gloeobacterales.",AB_0538
"drug repurposing or repositioning (dr) refers to finding new therapeutic applications for existing drugs. current computational dr methods face data representation and negative data sampling challenges. although retrospective studies attempt to operate various representations, it is a crucial step for an accurate prediction to aggregate these features and bring the associations between drugs and diseases into a unified latent space. in addition, the number of unknown associations between drugs and diseases, which is considered negative data, is much higher than the number of known associations, or positive data, leading to an imbalanced dataset. in this regard, we propose the drugrep-kg method, which applies a knowledge graph embedding approach for representing drugs and diseases, to address these challenges. despite the typical dr methods that consider all unknown drug-disease associations as negative data, we select a subset of unknown associations, provided the disease occurs because of an adverse reaction to a drug. drugrep-kg has been evaluated based on different settings and achieves an auc-roc (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 90.83% and an auc-pr (area under the precision-recall curve) of 90.10%, which are higher than in previous works. besides, we checked the performance of our framework in finding potential drugs for coronavirus infection and skin-related diseases: contact dermatitis and atopic eczema. drugrep-kg predicted beclomethasone for contact dermatitis, and fluorometholone, clocortolone, fluocinonide, and beclomethasone for atopic eczema, all of which have previously been proven to be effective in other studies. fluorometholone for contact dermatitis is a novel suggestion by drugrep-kg that should be validated experimentally. drugrep-kg also predicted the associations between covid-19 and potential treatments suggested by drugbank, in addition to new drug candidates provided with experimental evidence. the data and code underlying this article are available at https:// github.com/cbrc-lab/drugrep-kg.",AB_0538
"hospitalized newborns have an increased risk of malnutrition and, especially preterm infants, often experience malnutrition-related extrauterine growth restriction (eugr). the aim of this study was to predict the discharge weight and the presence of weight gain at discharge with machine learning (ml) algorithms. the demographic and clinical parameters were used to develop the models using fivefold cross-validation in the software-r with a neonatal nutritional screening tool (nnst). a total of 512 nicu patients were prospectively included in the study. length of hospital stay (los), parenteral nutrition treatment (pn), postnatal age (pna), surgery, and sodium were the most important variables in predicting the presence of weight gain at discharge with a random forest classification (auroc:0.847). the auroc of nnst-plus, which was improved by adding los, pn, pna, surgery, and sodium to nnst, increased by 16.5%. in addition, weight at admission, los, gestation-adjusted age at admission (> 40 weeks), sex, gestational age, birth weight, pna, sga, complications of labor and delivery, multiple birth, serum creatinine, and pn treatment were the most important variables in predicting discharge weight with an elastic net regression (r-2 = 0.748). this is the first study on the early prediction of eugr with promising clinical performance based on ml algorithms. it is estimated that the incidence of eugr can be improved with the implementation of this ml-based web tool (http://www.softmed.hacettepe.edu.tr/neo-.deer/) in clinical practice.",AB_0538
