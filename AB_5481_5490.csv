"in 2021, a group of seven italian institutions decided to bring together their know-how, experience, and instruments for measuring the drop size distribution (dsd) of atmospheric precipitation, giving birth to the italian group of disdrometry (in italian named gruppo italiano disdrometria, gid, https://www.gid-net.it/, last access: 16 may 2023). gid has made freely available a database of 1 min records of dsd collected by the disdrometer network along the italian peninsula. at the time of writing, the disdrometer network was composed of eight laser disdrometers belonging to six different italian institutions (including research centres, universities, and environmental regional agencies). this work aims to document the technical aspects of the italian dsd database consisting of 1 min sampling data from 2012 to 2021 in a uniform standard format defined within gid. although not all the disdrometers have the same data record length, the dsd data collection effort is the first of its kind in italy, and from here onwards, it opens up new opportunities in the surface characterization of microphysical properties of precipitation in the perspective of climate records and beyond. the version 01 gid database can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6875801 (adirosi et al., 2022), while version 02 can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7708563 (adirosi et al., 2023). the difference among the two versions is the diameter-fall velocity relation used for the dsd computation.",AB_0549
"deep learning (dl) applied to breast tissue segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (mri) has received increased attention in the last decade, however, the domain shift which arises from different vendors, acquisition protocols, and biological heterogeneity, remains an important but challenging obstacle on the path towards clinical implementation. in this paper, we propose a novel multilevel semantic-guided contrastive domain adaptation (mscda) framework to address this issue in an unsupervised manner. our approach incorporates self-training with contrastive learning to align feature representations between domains. in particular, we extend the contrastive loss by incorporating pixel-to-pixel, pixel-to-centroid, and centroid-to-centroid contrasts to better exploit the underlying semantic information of the image at different levels. to resolve the data imbalance problem, we utilize a category-wise cross-domain sampling strategy to sample anchors from target images and build a hybrid memory bank to store samples from source images. we have validated mscda with a challenging task of cross-domain breast mri segmentation between datasets of healthy volunteers and invasive breast cancer patients. extensive experiments show that mscda effectively improves the model's feature alignment capabilities between domains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. furthermore, the framework is shown to be label-efficient, achieving good performance with a smaller source dataset. the code is publicly available at https://github.com/shengkuangcn/mscda.(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0549

"background cancer immunotherapy is implemented by identifying antigens that are presented on the cell surface of cancer cells and illicit t-cell response (schumacher and schreiber, science 348:69-74, 2015; waldman et al., nat rev immunol 20:651-668, 2020; zhang et al., front immunol 12:672,356, 2021b). classical candidates of such antigens are the peptides resulting from genetic alterations and are named neoantigen (schumacher and schreiber, science 348:69-74, 2015). neoantigens have been widely catalogued across several human cancer types (tan et al., database (oxford) 2020;2020b; vigneron et al., cancer immun 13:15, 2013; yi et al., iscience 24:103,107, 2021; zhang et al., bmc bioinformatics 22:40, 2021a). recently, a new class of inducible antigens has been identified, namely substitutants, that are produced as a result of aberrant protein translation (pataskar et al., nature 603:721-727, 2022). main catalogues of substitutant expression across human cancer types, their specificity and association to gene expression signatures remain elusive for the scientific community's access. as a solution, we present abpepserver, an online database and analytical platform that can visualize a large-scale tumour proteomics analysis of substitutant expression across eight tumour types sourced from the cptac database (edwards et al., j proteome res 14:2707-713, 2015). functionally, abpepserver offers the analysis of gene-association signatures of substitutant peptides, a comparison of enrichment between tumour and tumour-adjacent normal tissues, and a list of peptides that serve as candidates for immunotherapy design. abpepserver will significantly enhance the exploration of aberrant protein production in human cancer, as exemplified in a case study. conclusion abpepserver is designed on an r shiny platform to catalogue substitutant peptides in human cancer. the application is available at https://rhpc.nki.nl/sites/shiny/abpep/. the code is available under gnu general public license from github (https://github.com/jasminesmn/abpepserver).",AB_0549
"service robots, in general, have to work independently and adapt to the dynamic changes happening in the environment in real time. one important aspect in such scenarios is to continually learn to recognize newer object categories when they become available. this combines two main research problems, namely, continual learning and 3-d object recognition. most of the existing research approaches include the use of deep convolutional neural networks (cnns) focusing on image data sets. a modified approach might be needed for continually learning 3-d object categories. a major concern in using cnns is the problem of catastrophic forgetting when a model tries to learn a new task. despite various proposed solutions to mitigate this problem, there still exist some downsides of such solutions, e.g., computational complexity, especially when learning a substantial number of tasks. these downsides can pose major problems in robotic scenarios where real-time response plays an essential role. toward addressing this challenge, we propose a new deep transfer learning approach based on a dynamic architectural method to make robots capable of open-ended learning about new 3-d object categories. furthermore, we make sure that the mentioned downsides are minimized to a great extent. experimental results showed that the proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art approaches with regards to accuracy and also substantially minimizes computational overhead. the code is available online at: https://github.com/sudhakaranjain/3d_den.",AB_0549
"introduction organ preservation is associated with superior functional outcome and quality of life (qol) compared with total mesorectal excision (tme) for rectal cancer. only 10% of patients are eligible for organ preservation following short-course radiotherapy (scrt, 25 gy in five fractions) and a prolonged interval (4-8 weeks) to response evaluation. the organ preservation rate could potentially be increased by dose-escalated radiotherapy. online adaptive magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy (mrgrt) is anticipated to reduce radiation-induced toxicity and enable radiotherapy dose escalation. this trial aims to establish the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) of dose-escalated scrt using online adaptive mrgrt. methods and analysis the preradar is a multi-centre phase i trial with a 6+3 dose-escalation design. patients with intermediate-risk rectal cancer (ct3c-d(mrf-)n1m0 or ct1-3(mrf-)n1m0) interested in organ preservation are eligible. patients are treated with a radiotherapy boost of 2x5 gy (level 0), 3x5 gy (level 1), 4x5 gy (level 2) or 5x5 gy (level 3) on the gross tumour volume in the week following standard scrt using online adaptive mrgrt. the trial starts on dose level 1. the primary endpoint is the mtd based on the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (dlt) per dose level. dlt is a composite of maximum one in nine severe radiation-induced toxicities and maximum one in three severe postoperative complications, in patients treated with tme or local excision within 26 weeks following start of treatment. secondary endpoints include the organ preservation rate, non-dlt, oncological outcomes, patient-reported qol and functional outcomes up to 2 years following start of treatment. imaging and laboratory biomarkers are explored for early response prediction. ethics and dissemination the trial protocol has been approved by the medical ethics committee of the university medical centre utrecht. the primary and secondary trial results will be published in international peer-reviewed journals. trial registration number who international clinical trials registry (nl8997; https://trialsearch.who.int).",AB_0549
"computing the matrix square root and its inverse in a differentiable manner is important in a variety of computer vision tasks. previous methods either adopt the singular value decomposition (svd) to explicitly factorize the matrix or use the newton-schulz iteration (ns iteration) to derive the approximate solution. however, both methods are not computationally efficient enough in either the forward pass or the backward pass. in this paper, we propose two more efficient variants to compute the differentiable matrix square root and the inverse square root. for the forward propagation, one method is to use matrix taylor polynomial (mtp), and the other method is to use matrix pade approximants (mpa). the backward gradient is computed by iteratively solving the continuous-time lyapunov equation using the matrix sign function. a series of numerical tests show that both methods yield considerable speed-up compared with the svd or the ns iteration. moreover, we validate the effectiveness of our methods in several real-world applications, including de-correlated batch normalization, second-order vision transformer, global covariance pooling for large-scale and fine-grained recognition, attentive covariance pooling for video recognition, and neural style transfer. the experiments demonstrate that our methods can also achieve competitive and even slightly better performances. code is available at https://github.com/kingjamessong/fastdifferentiablematsqrt.",AB_0549
"background: accurate biomarkers to monitor tumor load and response in metastatic colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery could optimize treatment regimens. objective: this study aimed to explore the clinical validity of tumor-informed quantification of circulating tumor dna in blood using ultradeep sequencing. design: resection specimens from 53 colorectal cancer patients were analyzed for tumor-specific mutations in 15 genes. these mutations were used to measure the presence of circulating tumor dna in preoperatively collected plasma samples using hybrid capture-based sequencing. additional postoperative measurements were performed 1 week after surgery in 16 patients. settings: the study was conducted at the radboud university medical center. patients: a total of 53 colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery of metastases were included. main outcome measures: the detection of circulating tumor dna. results: at least 1 tumor-specific mutation was detected in all tumor samples. in preoperative plasma samples, circulating tumor dna was detected in 88% (37/42) of systemic treatment-naive patients and in 55% (6/11) of patients who received preoperative chemotherapy. more specifically, circulating tumor dna was detected in 0% (0/3) of cases with a subtotal or partial pathologic response and in 75% (6/8) of cases without a pathologic response in the resection specimen (p = 0.06). in postoperative plasma samples, circulating tumor dna was detected in 80% (4/5) of patients with an incomplete resection and in 0% (0/11) of those with a complete resection (p = 0.003). limitations: the study was limited by the heterogeneity of the cohort and the small number of postoperative plasma samples. conclusions: these data indicate that tumor-informed circulating tumor dna detection in the plasma of patients undergoing surgery for metastatic colorectal cancer is feasible and may have clinical value in response monitoring and predicting residual disease. prospective studies are needed to establish the clinical utility of circulating tumor dna analysis to guide treatment decisions in these patients. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b990.",AB_0549
"pathogen genomics is transforming surveillance of infectious diseases, deepening our understanding of evolution and diffusion of etiological agents, host-pathogen interactions and antimicrobial resistance. this discipline is playing an important role in the development of one health surveillance with public health experts of various disciplines integrating methods applied to pathogen research, monitoring, management and prevention of outbreaks. especially with the notion that foodborne diseases may not be transmitted by food only, the aries genomics project aimed to deliver an information system for the collection of genomic and epidemiological data to enable genomics-based surveillance of infectious epidemics, foodborne outbreaks and diseases at the animal-human interface. keeping in mind that the users of the system comprised persons with expertise in a wide variety of domains, the system was expected to be used with a low learning curve directly by the persons target of the analyses' results, keeping the information exchange chains as short as possible. as a result, the irida-aries platform (https://irida.iss.it/) provides an intuitive web-based interface for multisectoral data collection and bioinformatic analyses. in practice, the user creates a sample and uploads the next-generation sequencing reads, then an analysis pipeline is launched automatically performing a series of typing and clustering operations fueling the information flow. instances of irida-aries host the italian national surveillance system for infections by listeria monocytogenes (lm) and the surveillance system for infections by shigatoxin-producing escherichia coli (stec). as of today, the platform does not provide tools to manage epidemiological investigations but serves as an instrument of aggregation for risk monitoring, capable of triggering alarms on possible critical situations that might go unnoticed otherwise.",AB_0549
"long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) regulate gene expression through different molecular mechanisms, in-cluding dna binding via the formation of rna:dna:dna triple helices (tpxs). despite the increasing amount of experimental evidence, tpxs investigation remains challenging. here we present 3plex, a soft-ware able to predict tpx interactions in silico. given an rna sequence and a set of dna sequences, 3plex integrates 1) hoogsteen pairing rules that describe the biochemical interactions between rna and dna nucleotides, 2) rna secondary structure prediction and 3) determination of the tpx thermal stability de-rived from a collection of tpx experimental evidences. we systematically collected and uniformly re-analysed published experimental lncrna binding sites on human and mouse genomes. we used these data to evaluate 3plex performance and showed that its specific features allow a reliable identification of tpx interactions. we compared 3plex with the other available software and obtained comparable or even better accuracy at a fraction of the computation time. interestingly, by inspecting collected data with 3plex we found that tpxs tend to be shorter and more degenerated than previously expected and that the majority of analysed lncrnas can directly bind to the genome by tpx formation. those results suggest that an im-portant fraction of lncrnas can exert its biological function through this mechanism. the software is available at https://github.com/molinerislab/3plex.
