"background: cardiac adrenergic receptor gene polymorphisms have the potential to influence risk of developing ventricular fibrillation (vf) during st-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, but no previous study has comprehensively investigated those most likely to alter norepinephrine release, signal transduction, or biased signaling. methods and results: in a case-control study, we recruited 953 patients with st-segment-elevation myocardial infarction without previous cardiac history, 477 with primary vf, and 476 controls without vf, and genotyped them for adrb1 arg389gly and ser49gly, adrb2 gln27glu and gly16arg, and adra2c ins322-325del. within each minor allele-containing genotype, haplotype, or 2-genotype combination, patients with incident vf were compared with non-vf controls by odds ratios (or) of variant frequencies referenced against major allele homozygotes. of 156 investigated genetic constructs, 19 (12.2%) exhibited significantly (p<0.05) reduced association with incident vf, and none was associated with increased vf risk except for adrb1 gly389 homozygotes in the subset of patients not receiving beta-blockers. adrb1 gly49 carriers (prevalence 23.0%) had an or (95% ci) of 0.70 (0.49-0.98), and the adra2c 322-325 deletion (del) carriers (prevalence 13.5%) had an or of 0.61 (0.39-0.94). when present in genotype combinations (8 each), both adrb1 gly49 carriers (or, 0.67 [0.56-0.80]) and adra2c del carriers (or, 0.57 [0.45-0.71]) were associated with reduced vf risk. conclusions: in st-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, the adrenergic receptor minor alleles adrb1 gly49, whose encoded receptor undergoes enhanced agonist-mediated internalization and beta-arrestin interactions leading to cardioprotective biased signaling, and adra2c del322-325, whose receptor causes disinhibition of norepinephrine release, are associated with a lower incidence of vf. registration: url: https://clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct00859300.",AB_0469
"the detection of structural chromosomal abnormalities (sca) is crucial for diagnosis, prognosis and man-agement of many genetic diseases and cancers. this detection, done by highly qualified medical experts, is tedious and time-consuming. we propose a highly performing and intelligent method to assist cytoge-neticists to screen for sca. each chromosome is present in two copies that make up a pair of chromo-somes. usually, sca are present in only one copy of the pair. convolutional neural networks (cnn) with siamese architecture are particularly relevant for evaluating similarities between two images, which is why we used this method to detect abnormalities between both chromosomes of a given pair. as a proof-of-concept, we first focused on a deletion occurring on chromosome 5 (del(5q)) observed in hema-tological malignancies. using our dataset, we conducted several experiments without and with data aug-mentation on seven popular cnn models. overall, performances obtained were very relevant for detecting deletions, particularly with xception and inceptionresnetv2 models achieving 97.50% and 97.01% of f1-score, respectively. we additionally demonstrated that these models successfully recog-nized another sca, inversion inv(3), which is one of the most difficult sca to detect. the performance improved when the training was applied on inversion inv(3) dataset, achieving 94.82% of f1-score. the technique that we propose in this paper is the first highly performing method based on siamese architec-ture that allows the detection of sca. our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/meabechar/ chromosomesiamesead.

"background: nanopore sequencing is crucial to metagenomic studies as its kilobase-long reads can contribute to resolving genomic structural differences among microbes. however, sequencing platform-specific challenges, including high base-call error rate, nonuniform read lengths, and the presence of chimeric artifacts, necessitate specifically designed analytical algorithms. the use of simulated datasets with characteristics that are true to the sequencing platform under evaluation is a cost-effective way to assess the performance of bioinformatics tools with the ground truth in a controlled environment. results: here, we present meta-nanosim, a fast and versatile utility that characterizes and simulates the unique properties of nanopore metagenomic reads. it improves upon state-of-the-art methods on microbial abundance estimation through a base-level quantification algorithm. meta-nanosim can simulate complex microbial communities composed of both linear and circular genomes and can stream reference genomes from online servers directly. simulated datasets showed high congruence with experimental data in terms of read length, error profiles, and abundance levels. we demonstrate that meta-nanosim simulated data can facilitate the development of metagenomic algorithms and guide experimental design through a metagenome assembly benchmarking task. conclusions: the meta-nanosim characterization module investigates read features, including chimeric information and abundance levels, while the simulation module simulates large and complex multisample microbial communities with different abundance profiles. all trained models and the software are freely accessible at github: https://github.com/bcgsc/nanosim.",AB_0469

"remote sensing (rs) of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (sif) has a great potential for monitoring plant photosynthetic activity. radiative transfer models (rtm) are essential to better interpret and extract information from sif signals. dart is one of the most comprehensive and accurate 3d rtms. its standard mode dart-ft simulates sif using a discrete ordinates method but is not adapted to large landscapes due to computational constraints. dart-lux, the new mode based on a bi-directional path tracing algorithm, greatly improves dart computational efficiency for simulating images. this paper presents the theory of a novel sif modelling algo-rithm in dart-lux. we verified its accuracy with dart-ft and the scope model for three types of canopies: turbid medium, maize field and forest. dart-lux closely matches dart-ft (relative difference < 2%) with much better computational efficiency depending on the scene complexity, number of spectral bands and needed ac-curacy. for example, simulation time is reduced by a factor of approximate to 48, and memory usage by approximate to 50 for a maize field at 1 cm resolution. it allowed to simulate sif images of large scenes as the 3 x 3 km2 ripperdan agricultural site that dart-ft could not simulate. the new sif modelling algorithm opens new horizons for rs studies of large and complex landscapes. it is available as part of released dart versions (v1152 onwards) (https://dart.omp. eu/).",AB_0469
"we investigate the high-pt tails of the pp -> lv and pp -> ll drell-yan processes as probes of new physics in semileptonic interactions with an arbitrary flavor structure. for this purpose, we provide a general decomposition of the 2 -> 2 scattering amplitudes in terms of form-factors that we match to specific scenarios, such as the standard model effective field theory (smeft), including all relevant operators up to dimension-8, as well as ultraviolet scenarios giving rise to tree-level exchange of new bosonic mediators with masses at the tev scale. by using the latest lhc run-ii data in the monolepton ( ev, mu v, tv) and dilepton (ee, mu mu, tt, e mu, et mu t) production channels, we derive constraints on the smeft wilson coefficients for semileptonic four-fermion and dipole operators with the most general flavor structure, as well as on all possible leptoquark models. for the smeft, we discuss the range of validity of the eft description, the relevance of omicron(1 /lambda(2)) and o(1 /lambda(4)) truncations, the impact of d = 8 operators and the effects of different quarkflavor alignments. finally, as a highlight, we extract for several new physics scenarios the combined limits from high- pt processes, electroweak pole measurements and low-energy flavor data for the b -> ctv transition, showing the complementarity between these different observables. our results are compiled in highpt (https://highpt.github.io), a package in mathematica which provides a simple way for users to extract the drell-yan tails likelihoods for semileptonic effective operators and for leptoquark models.",AB_0469
"background: exploring the function or the developmental history of cells in various organisms provides insights into a given cell type's core molecular characteristics and putative evolutionary mechanisms. numerous computational methods now exist for analyzing single-cell data and identifying cell states. these methods mostly rely on the expression of genes considered as markers for a given cell state. yet, there is a lack of scrna-seq computational tools to study the evolution of cell states, particularly how cell states change their molecular profiles. this can include novel gene activation or the novel deployment of programs already existing in other cell types, known as co-option.results: here we present scevonet, a python tool for predicting cell type evolution in cross-species or cancer-related scrna-seq datasets. scevonet builds the confusion matrix of cell states and a bipartite network connecting genes and cell states. it allows a user to obtain a set of genes shared by the characteristic signature of two cell states even between distantly-related datasets. these genes can be used as indicators of either evolutionary divergence or co-option occurring during organism or tumor evolution. our results on cancer and developmental datasets indicate that scevonet is a helpful tool for the initial screening of such genes as well as for measuring cell state similarities.conclusion: the scevonet package is implemented in python and is freely available from https://github.com/monsoro/scevonet. utilizing this framework and exploring the continuum of transcriptome states between developmental stages and species will help explain cell state dynamics.",AB_0469
"study objectives: this pilot study determined whether transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy for parasomnias (cbtp) reduces parasomnia and activity levels during sleep in a sample of adult sleep clinic outpatients. a secondary objective was to assess whether treatment produces improvements in daytime fatigue/sleepiness, perceived cognition, mood, and depression/anxiety/stress, as well as functional impairment in work and leisure activities.methods: this was a randomized controlled trial with cbtp and self-monitoring control conditions. participants were 19 adults with a dsm 5 parasomnia disorder who received individual cbtp virtually from their homes. cbtp consisted of psychoeducation, sleep hygiene and safety instructions, relaxation training, parasomnia techniques, and relapse prevention in a 6-week manualized, structured program. results: using a repeated measures analysis of variance model, and relative to a self-monitoring control condition, results showed that cbtp produced statistically significant improvements in parasomnia frequency, severity, nocturnal activity, and sleep efficiency. there was a trend toward reduced sleep-onset latency and improved work and social adjustment. of treated participants, 100% rated themselves as improved at study conclusion.conclusions: implications of these findings are that cognitive behavioral interventions for parasomnias are effective in lessening parasomnias. more investigation into this type of treatment is warranted.clinical trial registration: registry: clinicaltrials.gov; name: impact of cognitive behavioral therapy on parasomnias; url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ nct04633668; identifier: nct04633668.",AB_0469
"two studies (n = 1,522) examined the impact of role models in sport and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) domains where gender discrimination has resulted in a lack of high-profile women. we examined the role of gender matching of personally known and famous exemplars on women's and men's motivation. participants nominated a woman or man in sport (study 1) or stem (study 2) who was either famous or known to them personally; they then indicated the extent to which they perceived this individual to be a motivating role model. women and men were more motivated by personally known (vs. famous) role models. for famous exemplars, both women and men were most motivated by same-gender models (studies 1 and 2). for personally known exemplars, men were similarly motivated by same-and other-gender models (studies 1 and 2), but women were more motivated by same-gender models in sport (study 1). mediation analyses indicated that person-ally known (vs. famous) exemplars and, for women, same-(vs. other-) gender exemplars, were perceived as more attainable future selves and consequently were more motivating (study 2). given that there are fewer famous women in domains dominated by men, it is important to know if women can be inspired by personally known rather than famous individuals. these studies provide insight into the kinds of exemplars that are most motivating for women and may serve as a guide for educators and other practitioners seeking to provide the best role models for girls and women in domains dominated by men. additional online materials for this article are available on pwq's website at http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/03616843231156165.",AB_0469
"predicting the kinetics of reactions involving nucleic acid strands is a fundamental task in biology and biotechnology. reaction kinetics can be modeled as an elementary step continuous-time markov chain, where states correspond to secondary structures and transitions correspond to base pair formation and breakage. since the number of states in the markov chain could be large, rates are determined by estimating the mean first passage time from sampled trajectories. as a result, the cost of kinetic predictions becomes prohibitively expensive for rare events with extremely long trajectories. also problematic are scenarios where multiple predictions are needed for the same reaction, e.g., under different environmental conditions, or when calibrating model parameters, because a new set of trajectories is needed multiple times. we propose a new method, called pathway elaboration, to handle these scenarios. pathway elaboration builds a truncated continuous-time markov chain through both biased and unbiased sampling. the resulting markov chain has moderate state space size, so matrix methods can efficiently compute reaction rates, even for rare events. also the transition rates of the truncated markov chain can easily be adapted when model or environmental parameters are perturbed, making model calibration feasible. we illustrate the utility of pathway elaboration on toehold-mediated strand displacement reactions, show that it well-approximates trajectory-based predictions of unbiased elementary step models on a wide range of reaction types for which such predictions are feasible, and demonstrate that it performs better than alternative truncation-based approaches that are applicable for mean first passage time estimation. finally, in a small study, we use pathway elaboration to optimize the metropolis kinetic model of multistrand, an elementary step simulator, showing that the optimized parameters greatly improve reaction rate predictions. our framework and dataset are available at https://github.com/dna-and-natural-algorithms-group/pathwayelaboration.",AB_0469
