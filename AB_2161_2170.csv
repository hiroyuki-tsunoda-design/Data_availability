"gene regulation plays an important role in understanding the mechanisms of human biology and diseases. however, inferring causal relationships between all genes is challenging due to the large number of genes in the transcriptome. here, we present signet (statistical inference on gene regulatory networks), a flexible software package that reveals networks of causal regulation between genes built upon large-scale transcriptomic and genotypic data at the population level. like mendelian randomization, signet uses genotypic variants as natural instrumental variables to establish such causal relationships but constructs a transcriptome-wide gene regulatory network with high confidence. signet makes such a computationally heavy task feasible by deploying a well-designed statistical algorithm over a parallel computing environment. it also provides a user-friendly interface allowing for parameter tuning, efficient parallel computing scheduling, interactive network visualization, and confirmatory results retrieval. the open source signet software is freely available (https://www.zstats.org/signet/).",AB_0217
"motivation many approaches in systems biology have been applied in drug repositioning due to the increased availability of the omics data and computational biology tools. using a multi-omics integrated network, which contains information of various biological interactions, could offer a more comprehensive inspective and interpretation for the drug mechanism of action (moa).results we developed a computational pipeline for dissecting the hidden moas of drugs (open moa). our pipeline computes confidence scores to edges that represent connections between genes/proteins in the integrated network. the interactions showing the highest confidence score could indicate potential drug targets and infer the underlying molecular moas. open moa was also validated by testing some well-established targets. additionally, we applied open moa to reveal the moa of a repositioned drug (jnk-in-5a) that modulates the pklr expression in hepg2 cells and found stat1 is the key transcription factor. overall, open moa represents a first-generation tool that could be utilized for predicting the potential moa of repurposed drugs and dissecting de novo targets for developing effective treatments.availability and implementation source code is available at https://github.com/xinmengliao/open_moa.",AB_0217
"motivation recent frameworks based on deep learning have been developed to identify cancer subtypes from high-throughput gene expression profiles. unfortunately, the performance of deep learning is highly dependent on its neural network architectures which are often hand-crafted with expertise in deep neural networks, meanwhile, the optimization and adjustment of the network are usually costly and time consuming.results to address such limitations, we proposed a fully automated deep neural architecture search model for diagnosing consensus molecular subtypes from gene expression data (dnas). the proposed model uses ant colony algorithm, one of the heuristic swarm intelligence algorithms, to search and optimize neural network architecture, and it can automatically find the optimal deep learning model architecture for cancer diagnosis in its search space. we validated dnas on eight colorectal cancer datasets, achieving the average accuracy of 95.48%, the average specificity of 98.07%, and the average sensitivity of 96.24%, respectively. without the loss of generality, we investigated the general applicability of dnas further on other cancer types from different platforms including lung cancer and breast cancer, and dnas achieved an area under the curve of 95% and 96%, respectively. in addition, we conducted gene ontology enrichment and pathological analysis to reveal interesting insights into cancer subtype identification and characterization across multiple cancer types.availability and implementation the source code and data can be downloaded from https://github.com/userd113/dnas-main. and the web server of dnas is publicly accessible at 119.45.145.120:5001.",AB_0217

"introductionchronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) is a physical and mental disorder in which long-term fatigue is the main symptom. cfs patients are often accompanied by functional gastrointestinal diseases (fgids), which lead to decreased quality of life and increased fatigue. prolong-life-with-nine-turn-method (plwnt) is a kind of physical and mental exercise. its operation includes adjusting the mind, breathing and cooperating with eight self-rubbing methods and one upper body rocking method. plwnt was used to improve the digestive function in ancient china and to treat fgids such as functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome in modern times. previous studies have shown that plwnt can reduce fatigue in patients with cfs. but it is unclear whether the effect of plwnt on cfs fatigue is related to gastrointestinal function. the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between plwnt and fatigue and gastrointestinal function in patients with cfs.methodsthis study is a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial (rct). the whole study period is 38 weeks, including 2 weeks of baseline evaluation, 12 weeks of intervention and 6 months of follow-up. ninety-six cfs patients will be stratified random assigned to the intervention group (plwnt) and the control group (cognitive behavior treatment) in the ratio of 1:1 through the random number table generated by spss. in the evaluation of results, multidimensional fatigue inventory-20 (mfi-20), gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (gsrs), bristol stool form scale (bsfs), and short form 36 item health survey (sf-36) will be evaluated at week 0 (baseline), week 6 (midterm), week 12 (endpoint) and month 9 (follow up). the intestinal flora will be evaluated at week 0 (baseline) and week 12 (endpoint). the data results will be processed by statistical experts. the data analysis will be based on the intention to treat principle and per-protocol analysis. in the efficacy evaluation, repeated measurement analysis of variance will be used for data conforming to normal distribution or approximate normal distribution. the data which do not conform to the analysis of repeated measurement variance will be analyzed by the generalized estimation equation linear discriminant analysis will be used to clarify the difference species of intestinal flora. the significance level sets as 5%. the safety of interventions will be evaluated after each treatment session.discussionthis trial will provide evidence to plwnt exerting positive effects on fatigue and gastrointestinal function of cfs. it will further explore whether the improvement of plwnt on cfs fatigue is related to gastrointestinal function.trial registrationthe trial was registered at chinese clinical trial registry http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=151456 (registration no.: chictr2200056530). date: 2022-02-07.",AB_0217
"with the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, more and more computational models for generating new molecules are being developed. however, we are often confronted with the question of whether these compounds are easy or difficult to synthesize, which refers to synthetic accessibility of compounds. in this study, a deep learning based computational model called deepsa, was proposed to predict the synthesis accessibility of compounds, which provides a useful tool to choose molecules. deepsa is a chemical language model that was developed by training on a dataset of 3,593,053 molecules using various natural language processing (nlp) algorithms, offering advantages over state-of-the-art methods and having a much higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auroc), i.e., 89.6%, in discriminating those molecules that are difficult to synthesize. this helps users select less expensive molecules for synthesis, reducing the time and cost required for drug discovery and development. interestingly, a comparison of deepsa with a graph attention-based method shows that using smiles alone can also efficiently visualize and extract compound's informative features. deepsa is available online on the below web server (https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/deepsa/) of our group, and the code is available at https://github.com/shihang-wang-58/deepsa.",AB_0217
