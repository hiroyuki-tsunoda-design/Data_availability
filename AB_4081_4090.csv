"in this work, we introduce shiphullgan, a generic parametric modeller built using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (gans) for the versatile representation and generation of ship hulls. at a high level, the new model intends to address the current conservatism in the parametric ship design paradigm, where parametric modellers can only handle a particular ship type. we trained shiphullgan on a large dataset of 52,591 physically validated designs from a wide range of existing ship types, including container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, tugboats, and crew supply vessels. we developed a new shape extraction and representation strategy to convert all training designs into a common geometric representation of the same resolution, as typically gans can only accept vectors of fixed dimension as input. a space-filling layer is placed right after the generator component to ensure that the trained generator can cover all design classes. during training, designs are provided in the form of a shape-signature tensor (sst) which harnesses the compact geometric representation using geometric moments that further enable the inexpensive incorporation of physics-informed elements in ship design. we have shown through extensive comparative studies and optimisation cases that shiphullgan can generate designs with augmented features resulting in versatile design spaces that produce traditional and novel designs with geometrically valid and practically feasible shapes.video abstract: https://youtu.be/lt9z52vbgzi (c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0409
"the role of the sensory visual cortex during visual short-term memory (vstm) remains controversial. this controversy is possibly due to methodological issues in previous attempts to investigate the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) on vstm. the aim of this study was to use tms, while covering previous methodological deficits. sixty-four young adults were recruited to participate in two experiments (experiment 1: n = 36; experiment 2: n = 28) using a vstm orientation change-detection task under tms. monocular vision was ensured using red-blue goggles combined with red-blue stimuli. double-pulse tms was delivered at different times (experiment 1: 0, 200 or 1000 ms; experiment 2: 200, 1000 ms) during a 2 s maintenance phase, on one side of the occipital hemisphere. in experiment 2, a sham tms condition was introduced. decreased detection sensitivity (d') in the ipsilateral occipital hemisphere to visual hemifield, and in the real tms (compared with sham tms) condition indicated inhibitory tms effects, and thus, a causal involvement of the sensory visual cortex during early (200 ms) and late (1000 ms) maintenance in vstm. these findings are aligned with sensory recruitment, which proposes that both perceptual and memory processes rely upon the same neural substrates in the sensory visual cortex. the methods used in this study were preregistered and had received in-principle acceptance on 6 june 2022 (stage 1 protocol can be found in: https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/empdt).",AB_0409
"background infections are one of the leading causes of death in the neonatal period. this trial aims to evaluate if the provision of alcohol-based hand rub (abhr) to pregnant women for postnatal household use prevents severe infections (including sepsis, diarrhoea, pneumonia, or death) among infants during the first three postnatal months. methods through a cluster-randomised trial in eastern uganda, 72 clusters are randomised in a 2-arm design with rural villages as units of randomisation. we estimate to include a total of 5932 pregnant women at 34 weeks of gestation. all women and infants in the study are receiving standard antenatal and postnatal care. women in the intervention group additionally receive six litres of abhr and training on its use. research midwives conduct follow-up visits at participants' homes on days 1, 7, 28, 42, and 90 after birth and telephone calls on days 14, 48, and 60 to assess the mother and infant for study outcomes. primary analyses will be by intention to treat. discussion this study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of a locally available and low-cost intervention in preventing neonatal sepsis and early infant infections. if abhr is found effective, it could be implemented by adding it to birthing kits. trial registration pan african clinical trial registry, pactr202004705649428. registered 1 april 2020, https://pactr.samrc.ac.za/.",AB_0409
"background: early growth and body composition may influence the risk of obesity and health in adulthood. few studies have examined how undernutrition is associated with body composition in early life. objectives: we assessed stunting and wasting as correlates of body composition in young kenyan children.methods: nested in a randomized controlled nutrition trial, this longitudinal study assessed fat and fat-free mass (fm, ffm) using deuterium dilution technique among children at age 6 and 15 months. this trial was registered at http://controlled-trials.com/ (isrctn30012997). cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between z-score categories of length-for-age (laz) or weight-for-length (wlz) and fm, ffm, fat mass index (fmi), fat-free mass index (ffmi), triceps, and subscapular skinfolds were analyzed by linear mixed models.results: among the 499 children enrolled, breastfeeding declined from 99% to 87%, stunting increased from 13% to 32%, and wasting remained at 2% to 3% between 6 and 15 mo. compared with laz >0, stunted children had a 1.12 kg (95% ci: 0.88, 1.36; p < 0.001) lower ffm at 6 mo and increased to 1.59 kg (95% ci: 1.25, 1.94; p < 0.001) at 15 mo, corresponding to differences of 18% and 17%, respectively. when analyzing ffmi, the deficit in ffm tended to be less than proportional to children's height at 6 mo (p < 0.060) but not at 15 mo (p > 0.40). stunting was associated with 0.28 kg (95% ci: 0.09, 0.47; p = 0.004) lower fm at 6 mo. however, this association was not significant at 15 mo, and stunting was not associated with fmi at any time point. a lower wlz was generally associated with lower fm, ffm, fmi, and ffmi at 6 and 15 mo. differences in ffm, but not fm, increased with time, whereas ffmi differences did not change, and fmi differences generally decreased with time.conclusions: overall, low laz and wlz among young kenyan children were associated with reduced lean tissue, which may have long-term health consequences.",AB_0409
"motivation: finding outliers in rna-sequencing (rna-seq) gene expression (ge) can help in identifying genes that are aberrant and cause mendelian disorders. recently developed models for this task rely on modeling rna-seq ge data using the negative binomial distribution (nbd). however, some of those models either rely on procedures for inferring nbd's parameters in a nonbiased way that are computationally demanding and thus make confounder control challenging, while others rely on less computationally demanding but biased procedures and convoluted confounder control approaches that hinder interpretability. results: in this article, we present outsingle (outlier detection using singular value decomposition), an almost instantaneous way of detecting outliers in rna-seq ge data. it uses a simple log-normal approach for count modeling. for confounder control, it uses the recently discovered optimal hard threshold (oht) method for noise detection, which itself is based on singular value decomposition (svd). due to its svd/oht utilization, outsingle's model is straightforward to understand and interpret. we then show that our novel method, when used on rna-seq ge data with real biological outliers masked by confounders, outcompetes the previous state-of-the-art model based on an ad hoc denoising autoencoder. additionally, outsingle can be used to inject artificial outliers masked by confounders, which is difficult to achieve with previous approaches. we describe a way of using outsingle for outlier injection and proceed to show how outsingle outperforms its competition on 16 out of 18 datasets that were generated from three real datasets using outsingle's injection procedure with different outlier types and magnitudes. our methods are applicable to other types of similar problems involving finding outliers in matrices under the presence of confounders. availability and implementation: the code for outsingle is available at https://github.com/esalkovic/outsingle.",AB_0409
"we propose a novel approach to translate unpaired contrast computed tomography (ct) scans to noncontrast ct scans and the other way around. solving this task has two important applications: (i) to automatically generate contrast ct scans for patients for whom injecting contrast substance is not an option, and (ii) to enhance the alignment between contrast and non-contrast ct by reducing the differences induced by the contrast substance before registration.our approach is based on cycle-consistent generative adversarial convolutional transformers, for short, cytran. our neural model can be trained on unpaired images, due to the integration of a multi-level cycleconsistency loss. aside from the standard cycle-consistency loss applied at the image level, we propose to apply additional cycle-consistency losses between intermediate feature representations, which enforces the model to be cycle-consistent at multiple representations levels, leading to superior results. to deal with high-resolution images, we design a hybrid architecture based on convolutional and multi-head attention layers. in addition, we introduce a novel data set, coltea-lung-ct-100w, containing 100 3d triphasic lung ct scans (with a total of 37,290 images) collected from 100 female patients (there is one examination per patient). each scan contains three phases (non-contrast, early portal venous, and late arterial), allowing us to perform experiments to compare our novel approach with state-of-the-art methods for image style transfer.our empirical results show that cytran outperforms all competing methods. moreover, we show that cytran can be employed as a preliminary step to improve a state-of-the-art medical image alignment method. we release our novel model and data set as open source at: https://github.com/ristea/cycletransformer.our qualitative and subjective human evaluations reveal that cytran is the only approach that does not introduce visual artifacts during the translation process. we believe this is a key advantage in our application domain, where medical images need to precisely represent the scanned body parts.

"we introduce version 2.0 of z'-explorer, a software tool that provides a simple, fast, and user-friendly test of models with an extra u (1) gauge boson (z') against experimental lhc results. the main novelty of the second version is the inclusion of missing energy searches, as the first version only included final states into sm particles. hence z'-explorer 2.0 is able to test dark matter models where the z' acts as an s-channel mediator between the standard model and the dark sector, a widespread benchmark employed by the atlas and cms experimental collaborations. to this end, we perform here the first public reinterpretation of the most recent atlas mono-jet search with 139 fb-1. in addition, the corresponding searches in the visible final states have also been updated. we illustrate the power of our code by re -obtaining public plots and also showing novel results. in particular, we study the cases where the z' couples strongly to top quarks (top-philic), where dark matter couples with a mixture of vector and axial-vector couplings, and also perform a scan in the parameter space of a string inspired stuckelberg model. z'-explorer 2.0 is publicly available on github. program summary program title: z'-explorer 2.0 cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /k7tdp8kwgf .2 developer's repository link: https://github .com /ro -sanda /z--explorer-2 .0 licensing provisions: gplv3 programming language: c++ and bash nature of problem: new sm neutral gauge bosons, z', are ubiquitously present in models of new physics. in order to confront these models versus a large and ever-growing library of lhc searches, z'-explorer 1.0 had already included all final states including standard model particles. notably, the previous version of this tool lacked the so-called invisible final states manifested as a momentum imbalance in the transverse plane (missing energy). these searches help to probe mediators into a dark sector, where a dark matter candidate resides. solution method: z'-explorer encodes the production cross sections for z' bosons at the lhc as a function of their mass, allowing for a fast evaluation of the exclusion limits. this version of z'-explorer includes a careful validation of the latest search with one energetic jet (mono-jet) performed by the atlas collaboration. hence one can now test if a given point in parameter space is excluded by both visible and invisible searches. the modular structure of the code has been kept, which allows for potential additions (low-energy constraints, flavor, extrapolation to future colliders).
