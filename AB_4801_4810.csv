"backgroundicu survivors often suffer from prolonged physical and mental impairments resulting in the so called post-intensive care syndrome (pics). the aftercare of former icu patients affected by pics in particular has not been addressed sufficiently in germany so far. the aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a pragmatic randomised trial (rct) comparing an intensive care unit (icu) follow-up clinic intervention to usual care.methodsthis pilot study in a german university hospital evaluated the feasibility of a pragmatic rct. patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to an icu follow-up clinic intervention or to usual care. the concept of this follow-up clinic was previously developed in a participatory process with patients, next of kin, health care professionals and researchers. we performed a process evaluation and determined acceptability, fidelity, completeness of measurement instruments and practicality as feasibility outcomes. the rct's primary outcome (health-related quality of life) was assessed six months after icu discharge by means of the physical component scale of the short-form-12 self-report questionnaire.resultsthe pilot study was conducted from june 2020 to may 2021 with 21 and 20 participants in the intervention and control group. principal findings related to feasibility were 85% consent rate (n = 48), 62% fidelity rate, 34% attrition rate (n = 41) and 77% completeness of outcome measurements. the primary effectiveness outcome (health-related quality of life) could be measured in 93% of participants who completed the study (n = 27). the majority of participants (85%) needed assistance with follow-up questionnaires (practicality). median length of icu stay was 13 days and 85% (n = 41) received mechanical ventilation, median sequential organ failure assessment score was nine. six-month follow-up assessment was planned for all study participants and performed for 66% (n = 41) of the participants after 197 days (median).conclusionthe participatory developed intervention of an icu follow-up clinic and the pragmatic pilot rct both seem to be feasible. we recommend to start a pragmatic rct on the effectiveness of the icu follow-up clinic.trial registrationclinicaltrials.gov us nlm, nct04186468, submission: 02/12/2019, registration: 04/12/2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04186468",AB_0481
"motivation: the detection of homology through sequence comparison is a typical first step in the study of protein function and evolution. in this work, we explore the applicability of protein language models to this task.results: we introduce plm-blast, a tool inspired by blast, that detects distant homology by comparing single-sequence representations (embeddings) derived from a protein language model, prott5. our benchmarks reveal that plm-blast maintains a level of accuracy on par with hhsearch for both highly similar sequences (with >50% identity) and markedly divergent sequences (with <30% identity), while being significantly faster. additionally, plm-blast stands out among other embedding-based tools due to its ability to compute local alignments. we show that these local alignments, produced by plm-blast, often connect highly divergent proteins, thereby highlighting its potential to uncover previously undiscovered homologous relationships and improve protein annotation. availability and implementation:plm-blast is accessible via the mpi bioinformatics toolkit as a web server for searching precomputed data-bases (https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/plmblast). it is also available as a standalone tool for building custom databases and performingbatch searches (https://github.com/labstructbioinf/plm-blast).",AB_0481
"motivation flux balance analysis (fba) is widely recognized as an important method for studying metabolic networks. when incorporating flux measurements of certain reactions into an fba problem, it is possible that the underlying linear program may become infeasible, e.g. due to measurement or modeling inaccuracies. furthermore, while the biomass reaction is of central importance in fba models, its stoichiometry is often a rough estimate and a source of high uncertainty.results in this work, we present a method that allows modifications to the biomass reaction stoichiometry as a means to (i) render the fba problem feasible and (ii) improve the accuracy of the model by corrections in the biomass composition. optionally, the adjustment of the biomass composition can be used in conjunction with a previously introduced approach for balancing inconsistent fluxes to obtain a feasible fba system. we demonstrate the value of our approach by analyzing realistic flux measurements of e.coli. in particular, we find that the growth-associated maintenance (gam) demand of atp, which is typically integrated with the biomass reaction, is likely overestimated in recent genome-scale models, at least for certain growth conditions. in light of these findings, we discuss issues related to the determination and inclusion of gam values in constraint-based models. overall, our method can uncover potential errors and suggest adjustments in the assumed biomass composition in fba models based on inconsistencies between the model and measured fluxes.availability and implementation the developed method has been implemented in our software tool cnapy available from https://github.com/cnapy-org/cnapy.",AB_0481
"faithful genome duplication is a challenging task for dividing mammalian cells, particularly under replication stress where timely resolution of late replication intermediates (lris) becomes crucial prior to cell division. in human cancer cells, mitotic dna repair synthesis (midas) is described as a final mechanism for the resolution of lris to avoid lethal chromosome missegregation. rad52-driven midas achieves this mission in part by generating gaps/breaks on metaphase chromosomes, which preferentially occur at common fragile sites (cfs). we previously demonstrated that a midas mechanism also exists in untransformed and primary human cells, which is rad52 independent but requires fancd2. however, the properties of this form of midas are not well understood. here, we report that fancd2-driven midas in untransformed human cells: 1) requires a prerequisite step of fancd2 mono-ubiquitination by a subset of fanconi anemia (fa) proteins, 2) primarily acts to preserve cfs stability but not to prevent chromo-some mis-segregation, and 3) depends on helq, which potentially functions at an early step. hence, fancd2-driven midas in untransformed cells is built to protect cfs stability, whereas rad52-driven midas in cancer cells is likely adapted to prevent chromosome missegregation at the cost of cfs expression. notably, we also identified a novel form of midas, which surfaces to function when fancd2 is absent in untransformed cells. our findings substantiate the complex nature of midas and a link between its deficiencies and the pathogenesis of fa, a human genetic disease.(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://crea-tivecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0481
"drug repurposing is an important strategy in covid-19 treatment, but many clinically approved compounds have not been extensively studied in the context of embryogenesis, thus limiting their administration during pregnancy. here we used the zebrafish embryo model organism to test the effects of 162 marketed drugs on cardiovascular development. among the compounds used in the clinic for covd-19 treatment, we found that remdesivir led to reduced body size and heart functionality at clinically relevant doses. ritonavir and baricitinib showed reduced heart functionality and molnupiravir and baricitinib showed effects on embryo activity. sabizabulin was highly toxic at concentrations only 5 times higher than cmax and led to a mean mortality of 20% at cmax. furthermore, we tested if zebrafish could be used as a model to study inflammatory response in response to spike protein treatment and found that remdesivir, ritonavir, molnupiravir, baricitinib as well as sabizabulin counteracted the inflammatory response related gene expression upon sars-cov-2 spike protein treatment. our results show that the zebrafish allows to study immune-modulating properties of covid-19 compounds and highlights the need to rule out secondary defects of compound treatment on embryogenesis. all results are available on a user friendly web-interface https://share.streamlit.io/alernst/covasc_dataapp/main/covasc_dataapp.py that provides a comprehensive overview of all observed phenotypic effects and allows personalized search on specific compounds or group of compounds. furthermore, the presented platform can be expanded for rapid detection of developmental side effects of new compounds for treatment of covid-19 and further viral infectious diseases.",AB_0481
"advances in remote sensing image processing techniques have further increased the demand for annotated datasets. however, preparing annotated multi-temporal 2d/3d multimodal data is especially challenging, both for the increased costs of the annotation step and the lack of multimodal acquisitions available on the same area. we introduce the simulated multimodal aerial remote sensing (smars) dataset, a synthetic dataset aimed at the tasks of urban semantic segmentation, change detection, and building extraction, along with a description of the pipeline to generate them and the parameters required to set our rendering. samples in the form of orthorectified photos, digital surface models and ground truth for all the tasks are provided. unlike existing datasets, orthorectified images and digital surface models are derived from synthetic images using photogrammetry, yielding more realistic simulations of the data. the increased size of smars, compared to available datasets of this kind, facilitates both traditional and deep learning algorithms. reported experiments from state-of-the-art algorithms on smars scenes yield satisfactory results, in line with our expectations. both benefits of the smars datasets and constraints imposed by its use are discussed. specifically, building detection on the smars-real potsdam cross-domain test demonstrates the quality and the advantages of proposed synthetic data generation workflow. smars is published as an isprs benchmark dataset and can be downloaded from https://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm1/wg8/benchmark_smars/.",AB_0481
"introduction: comprehensive studies investigating sustained hypercoagulability, endothelial function, and/or inflammation in relation to post-covid-19 (pcc) symptoms with a prolonged follow-up are currently lacking. therefore, the aim of this single-centre cohort study was to investigate serum biomarkers of coagulation activation, microvascular dysfunction, and inflammation in relation to persisting symptoms two years after acute covid-19. methods: patients diagnosed with acute sars-cov-2 infection between february and june 2020 were recruited. outcome measures included the corona follow-up (corfu) questionnaire, which is based on an internationally developed and partially validated basic questionnaire on persistent pcc symptoms. additionally, plasma biomarkers reflecting coagulation activation, endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation were measured. results: 167 individuals were approached of which 148 (89%) completed the corfu questionnaire. at 24 months after acute infection, fatigue was the most prevalent pcc symptom (84.5%). over 50% of the patients experienced symptoms related to breathing, cognition, sleep or mobility; 30.3% still experienced at least one severe or extreme (4 or 5 on a 5-point scale) pcc symptom. multiple correlations were found between several pcc symptoms and markers of endothelial dysfunction (endothelin-1 and von willebrand factor) and systemic inflammation (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist). no positive correlations were found between pcc symptoms and coagulation complexes. discussion: in conclusion, this study shows that at 24 months after acute covid-19 infection patients experience a high prevalence of pcc symptoms which correlate with inflammatory cytokine il-1ra and markers of endothelial dysfunction, especially endothelin-1. our data may provide a rationale for the selection of treatment strategies for further clinical studies. trial registration: this study was performed in collaboration with the corona follow-up (corfu) study (nct05240742, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ nct05240742).",AB_0481
"backgroundgout is the most common form of rheumatic disease in which monosodium urate crystals are deposited in the joints followed by acute inflammatory reactions. there are various approved drugs that can be prescribed for pain relief during an acute gout attack. however, to date, no direct comparison of efficacy of colchicine and prednisolone for the treatment of acute gout attacks has been investigated. furthermore, the majority of previous research studies were not only conducted in tertiary centres but also excluded patients with common comorbidities due to contraindications to naproxen.methodsthis pragmatic, prospective, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, randomized, non-inferiority trial investigates whether prednisolone (intervention) is non-inferior to treatment with colchicine (active control) in patients with acute gout. adult patients presenting with acute gout to their general practitioners in 60 practices across 3 university sites (greifswald, gottingen, and wurzburg) are eligible to participate in the study. participants in the intervention group receive 30 mg prednisolone for 5 days. those in the control group receive low-dose colchicine (day 1: 1.5 mg; days 2-5: 1 mg). the primary outcome is the absolute level of the most severe pain on day 3 (in the last 24 h) measured with an 11-item numerical rating scale. day 0 is the day patients take their study medication for the first time. they are then asked to fill out a study diary the same time each day for pain quantification. pain scores are used for comparison between the two medications. secondary outcomes are average response to treatment, swelling, tenderness and physical function of the joint, patients' global assessment of treatment success, use of additional pain medication and non-pharmacological pain therapies. for safety reasons, potential side effects and course of systolic blood pressure are assessed.discussionthis trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness of pain reduction and side effects of colchicine and prednisolone in acute gout in primary care.trial registrationclinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct05698680 first posted on january 26, 2023 (retrospectively registered). url of trial registry record: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/nct05698680",AB_0481

"we present the gpry algorithm for fast bayesian inference of general (non -gaussian) posteriors with a moderate number of parameters. gpry does not need any pre -training, special hardware such as gpus, and is intended as a drop-in replacement for tradi-tional monte carlo methods for bayesian inference. our algorithm is based on generating a gaussian process surrogate model of the log-posterior, aided by a support vector machine classifier that excludes extreme or non-finite values. an active learning scheme allows us to reduce the number of required posterior evaluations by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional monte carlo inference. our algorithm allows for parallel evaluations of the posterior at optimal locations, further reducing wall-clock times. we significantly improve performance using properties of the posterior in our active learning scheme and for the def-inition of the gp prior. in particular we account for the expected dynamical range of the posterior in different dimensionalities. we test our model against a number of synthetic and cosmological examples. gpry outperforms traditional monte carlo methods when the evalu-ation time of the likelihood (or the calculation of theoretical observables) is of the order of seconds; for evaluation times of over a minute it can perform inference in days that would take months using traditional methods. gpry is distributed as an open source python package (pip install gpry) and can also be found at https://github.com/jonaselgammal/gpry. jcap10(2023)021",AB_0481
