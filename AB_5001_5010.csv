"objective: to assess the value of a morphine patient controlled intravenous analgesia (pcia)methods: 30 adult patients were treated with oral analgesics (protocol group) and compared to 30 patients treated with a morphine pcia for the first 3 postoperative days (pods) after te. average and maximum pain severities (numeric rating scale -- nrs: 0-10) on pods 1-3, analgesic score, quality of life, patient satisfaction and side effects were defined as outcome measures.results: average pain severities of the protocol and the pcia group were of similar magnitude (nrs) (pod1: 4.48 vs. 4.71 [p = 0.68], pod2: 4.75 vs. 4.22 [p = 0.32] and pod3: 4.44 vs. 4.25 [p = 0.71]). maximum pain intensities on pod1 (p = 0.92), pod2 (p = 0.51) and pod3 (p = 0.36) were also comparable between both groups. patients with a pcia consumed significantly more opioids (p = 0.001) without significant more side-effects. conclusion: the pcia did not provide a superior pain control compared to oral analgesics. in view of the considerable effort and the high opioid consumption, it cannot be recommended as a standardized application for pain control after te.(c) 2021 associac , a tilde o brasileira de otorrinolaringologia e cirurgia c acute accent ervico-facial. published by elsevier editora ltda. this is an open access article under the cc by license (http://",AB_0501
"computing occupancy grids with lidar data, is a popular strategy for environment representation. in the last two decades, several authors have proposed different methods to render the sensed information into the grids, seeking to obtain computational efficiency or accurate environment modeling. however, no comparison regarding their performance under object detection in autonomous driving applications has been found in the literature. as a result, this work compares six representative lidar scan rendering strategies in a quantitative manner. to that end, a novel quantitative evaluation framework for occupancy grids is proposed. it addresses the two main steps of object detection: object segmentation and features estimation, proposing a meaningful procedure, repeatable with other og approaches. the code of this evaluation framework is available in https://git-autopia.car.upm-csic.es/open_source/occupancy_grid_object_detection_evaluation.git.(c) 2023 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0501
"motivation: somatic mutations are usually called by analyzing the dna sequence of a tumor sample in conjunction with a matched normal. however, a matched normal is not always available, for instance, in retrospective analysis or diagnostic settings. for such cases, tumor-only somatic variant calling tools need to be designed. previously proposed approaches demonstrate inferior performance on whole-genome sequencing (wgs) samples. results: we present the convolutional neural network-based approach called deepsom for detecting somatic single nucleotide polymorphism and short insertion and deletion variants in tumor wgs samples without a matched normal. we validate deepsom by reporting its performance on five different cancer datasets. we also demonstrate that on wgs samples deepsom outperforms previously proposed methods for tumor-only somatic variant calling. availability and implementation: deepsom is available as a github repository at https://github.com/heiniglab/deepsom. contact: matthias.heinig@helmholtz-muenchen.de supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0501
"background: diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (ph) is often delayed or missed, leading to disease progression and missed treatment opportunities. in this study, we measured variation in care provided by board-certified cardiologists and pulmonologists in simulated patients with potentially undiagnosed ph. methods and results: in a cross-sectional study (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov, nct04693793), 219 us practicing cardiologists and pulmonologists cared for simulated patients presenting with symptoms of chronic dyspnea and associated signs of potential ph. we scored the clinical quality of care decisions made in a clinical encounter against predetermined evidence based criteria. overall, quality of care scores ranged from 18% to 74%, averaging 43.2%+/- 11.5%. ph, when present, was correctly suspected 49.1% of the time. conversely, physicians incorrectly identified ph in 53.7% of non ph cases. physicians ordered 2-dimensional echocardiography in just 64.3% of cases overall. physicians who ordered 2-dimensional echocardiography in the ph cases were significantly more likely to get the presumptive diagnosis (61.9% versus 30.7%; p < 0.001). ordering other diagnostic work up items showed similar results for ventilation/perfusion scan (81.5% versus 51.4%; p=0.005) and high resolution computed tomography (60.4% versus 43.2%; p=0.001). physicians who correctly identified ph were significantly more likely to order confirmatory right heart catheterization or refer to ph center (67.3% versus 15.8%; p < 0.001). conclusions: a wide range of care in the clinical practice among simulated patients presenting with possible ph was found, specifically in the evaluation and plan for definitive diagnosis of patients with ph. the delay or misdiagnosis of ph is likely attributed to a low clinical suspicion, nonspecific symptoms, and underuse of key diagnostic tests.",AB_0501
"biological condensates are membraneless organelles with different material properties. proteins and rnas are the main components, but most of their interactions are still unknown. here, we introduce praline, a database for the interrogation of proteins and rnas contained in stress granules, processing bodies and other assemblies including droplets and amyloids. praline provides information about the predicted and experimentally validated protein-protein, protein-rna and rna-rna interactions. for proteins, it reports the liquid-liquid phase separation and liquid-solid phase separation propensities. for rnas, it provides information on predicted secondary structure content. praline shows detailed information on human single-nucleotide variants, their clinical significance and presence in protein and rna binding sites, and how they can affect condensates' physical properties. availability and implementation: praline is freely accessible on the web at http://praline.tartaglialab.com. contact: alexandros.armaos@iit.it or gian.tartaglia@iit.it",AB_0501
"golgi-associated plant pathogenesis related protein 1 (gapr-1) acts as a negative regulator of autop-hagy by interacting with beclin 1 at golgi membranes in mammalian cells. the molecular mechanism of this interaction is largely unknown. we recently showed that human gapr-1 (hgapr-1) has amyloido-genic properties resulting in the formation of protein condensates upon overexpression in saccharomyces cerevisiae. here we show that human beclin 1 (hbeclin 1) has several predicted amyloidogenic regions and that overexpression of hbeclin 1-mcherry in yeast also results in the formation of fluorescent protein condensates. surprisingly, co-expression of hgapr-1-gfp and hbeclin 1-mcherry results in a strong reduction of hbeclin 1 condensates. mutations of the known interaction site on the hgapr-1 and hbeclin 1 surface abolished the effect on condensate formation during co-expression without affecting the con-densate formation properties of the individual proteins. similarly, a hbeclin 1-derived b18 peptide that is known to bind hgapr-1 and to interfere with the interaction between hgapr-1 and hbeclin 1, abol-ished the reduction of hbeclin 1 condensates by co-expression of hgapr-1. these results indicate that the same type of protein-protein interactions interfere with condensate formation during co-expression of hgapr-1 and hbeclin 1 as previously described for their interaction at golgi membranes. the amyloido-genic properties of the b18 peptide were, however, important for the interaction with hgapr-1, as mutant peptides with reduced amyloidogenic properties also showed reduced interaction with hgapr-1 and reduced interference with hgapr-1/hbeclin 1 condensate formation. we propose that amyloidogenic interactions take place between hgapr-1 and hbeclin 1 prior to condensate formation.(c) 2023 the authors. published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://crea-tivecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0501
"parkinson's disease (pd) progresses with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta region of the brain. the superior mechanisms and the cause of this specific localized neurodegeneration is currently unknown. however, experimental evidence indicates a link between pd progression and reactive oxygen species with imbalanced metal homeostasis. wild-type caenorhabditis elegans exposed to redoxactive metals was used as the model organism to study cellular response to imbalanced metal homeostasis linked to neurodegenerative diseases. using modern hyphenated techniques such as capillary electrophoresis coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, alterations in the lipidome and metallome were determined in vivo. in contrast to iron, most of the absorbed zinc and manganese were loosely bound. we observed changes in the phospholipid composition for acute iron and manganese exposures, as well as chronic zinc exposure. furthermore, we focused on the mitochondrial membrane alteration due to its importance in neuronal function. however, significant changes in the inner mitochondrial membrane by determination of cardiolipin species could only be observed for acute iron exposure. these results indicate different intracellular sites of local ros generation, depending on the redox active metal. our study combines metallomic and lipidomic alterations as the cause and consequence to enlighten intracellular mechanisms in vivo, associated with pd progression. the mass spectrometry raw data have been deposited to the massive database (https://massive. ucsd.edu) with the identifier msv000090796 and 10.25345/c51j97c8f.",AB_0501
"motivation: as non-coding driver mutations move more into the focus of cancer research, a comprehensive and easy-to-use software solution for regulatory variant analysis and data visualization is highly relevant. the interpretation of regulatory variants in large tumor genome cohorts requires specialized analysis and visualization of multiple layers of data, including for example breakpoints of structural variants, enhancer elements and additional available gene locus annotation, in the context of changes in gene expression.results: we introduce a user-friendly tool, revana (regulatory variant analysis), that can aggregate and visually represent regulatory variants from cancer genomes in a gene-centric manner. it requires whole-genome and rna sequencing data of a cohort of tumor samples and creates interactive html reports summarizing the most important regulatory events.availability and implementation: revana is implemented in r and javascript. it is available for download as an r package under < https://github.com/kitz-heidelberg/revana >. sample results can be viewed under < https://github.com/kitz-heidelberg/revana-demo-report > and a short walkthrough is available under < https://github.com/kitz-heidelberg/revana-demo-data >.",AB_0501
"background: in recent years, 3-dimensional (3d) spheroid models have become increasingly popular in scientific research as they provide a more physiologically relevant microenvironment that mimics in vivo conditions. the use of 3d spheroid assays has proven to be advantageous as it offers a better understanding of the cellular behavior, drug efficacy, and toxicity as compared to traditional 2dimensional cell culture methods. however, the use of 3d spheroid assays is impeded by the absence of automated and user-friendly tools for spheroid image analysis, which adversely affects the reproducibility and throughput of these assays. results: to address these issues, we have developed a fully automated, web-based tool called spheroscan, which uses the deep learning framework called mask regions with convolutional neural networks (r-cnn) for image detection and segmentation. to develop a deep learning model that could be applied to spheroid images from a range of experimental conditions, we trained the model using spheroid images captured using incucyte live-cell analysis system and a conventional microscope. performance evaluation of the trained model using validation and test datasets shows promising results. conclusion: spheroscan allows for easy analysis of large numbers of images and provides interactive visualization features for a more in-depth understanding of the data. our tool represents a significant advancement in the analysis of spheroid images and will facilitate the widespread adoption of 3d spheroid models in scientific research. the source code and a detailed tutorial for spheroscan are available at https://github.com/functionalurology/spheroscan.",AB_0501
"recent advances in reinforcement learning (rl) have increased the promise of introduc-ing cognitive assistance and automation to robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (rals). however, progress in algorithms and methods depends on the availability of standardized learning environments that represent skills relevant to rals. we present lapgym, a frame-work for building rl environments for rals that models the challenges posed by surgical tasks, and sofa env, a diverse suite of 12 environments. motivated by surgical training, these environments are organized into 4 tracks: spatial reasoning, deformable object manipulation & grasping, dissection, and thread manipulation. each environment is highly parametrizable for increasing difficulty, resulting in a high performance ceiling for new algorithms. we use proximal policy optimization (ppo) to establish a baseline for model-free rl algorithms, investigating the effect of several environment parameters on task difficulty. finally, we show that many environments and parameter configurations reflect well-known, open problems in rl research, allowing researchers to continue explor-ing these fundamental problems in a surgical context. we aim to provide a challenging, standard environment suite for further development of rl for rals, ultimately helping to realize the full potential of cognitive surgical robotics. lapgym is publicly accessible through github (https://github.com/scheiklp/lap_gym).",AB_0501
