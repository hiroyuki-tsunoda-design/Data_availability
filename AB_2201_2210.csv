"room layout estimation aims to predict the spatial structure of a room from a single image. most existing methods relying on 2d cues are suitable for cuboid rooms, but non-cuboid rooms. 3d layout estimation methods can reconstruct 3d models of general rooms, but they are trained with depth information on high collection costs, consume large computation resources, and run slowly. this paper considers an undirected graph representation method of the general room layouts, which includes cuboid and non-cuboid rooms consisting of a single ceiling, a single floor, and multiple walls. to this end, we first predict the positions of the layout vertices and then use the network automatically learn the connection relationship between the vertices. the final layout is obtained through a simple layout inference post-processing algorithm. the experimental results both on cuboid and non-cuboid datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. the code is available at https://github. com/hui-yao/2d-graph-layout-estimation.",AB_0221
"plants produce a wide range of bioactive peptides as part of their innate defense mechanisms. with the explosive growth of plant-derived peptides, verifying the therapeutic function using traditional experimental methods are resources and time consuming. therefore, it is necessary to predict the therapeutic function of plant-derived peptides more effectively and accurately with reduced waste of resources and thus expedite the development of plant peptides. we herein developed a repository of plant peptides predicted to have multiple therapeutic functions, named as mfppdb (multi-functional plant peptide database). mfppdb including 1,482,409 single or multiple functional plant origin therapeutic peptides derived from 121 fundamental plant species. the functional categories of these therapeutic peptides include 41 different features such as anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-hiv, anti-viral, and anti-cancer. the detailed physicochemical information of these peptides was presented in functional search and physicochemical property search module, which can help users easily access the peptide information by the plant peptide species, id, and functions, or by their peptide id, isoelectric point, peptide sequence, and molecular weight through web-friendly interface. we further matched the predicted peptides to nine state-of-the-art curated functional peptide databases and found that at least 293,408 of the peptides possess functional potentials. overall, mfppdb integrated a massive number of plant peptides have single or multiple therapeutic functions, which will facilitate the comprehensive research in plant peptidomics. mfppdb can be freely accessed through http://124.223.195.214:9188/mfppdb/index.",AB_0221
"background: genome-scale phylogenetic analysis based on core gene sets is routinely used in microbiological research. however, the techniques are still not approachable for individuals with little bioinformatics experience. here, we present easycgtree, a user-friendly and cross-platform pipeline to reconstruct genome-scale maximum-likehood (ml) phylogenetic tree using supermatrix (sm) and supertree (st) approaches.results: easycgtree was implemented in perl programming languages and was built using a collection of published reputable programs. all the programs were precompiled as standalone executable files and contained in the easycgtree package. it can run after installing perl language environment. several profile hidden markov models (hmms) of core gene sets were prepared in advance to construct a profile hmm database (phd) that was enclosed in the package and available for homolog searching. customized gene sets can also be used to build profile hmm and added to the phd via easycgtree. taking 43 genomes of the genus paracoccus as the testing data set, consensus (a variant of the typical sm), sm, and st trees were inferred via easycgtree successfully, and the sm trees were compared with those inferred via the pipelines ubcg and bcgtree, using the metrics of cophenetic correlation coefficients (ccc) and robinson-foulds distance (topological distance). the results suggested that easycgtree can infer sm trees with nearly identical topology (distance < 0.1) and accuracy (ccc > 0.99) to those of trees inferred with the two pipelines.conclusions: easycgtree is an all-in-one automatic pipeline from input data to phylogenomic tree with guaranteed accuracy, and is much easier to install and use than the reference pipelines. in addition, st is implemented in easycgtree conveniently and can be used to explore prokaryotic evolutionary signals from a different perspective. the easycgtree version 4 is freely available for linux and windows users at github (https://github.com/zdf1987/easycgtree4).",AB_0221
"extensive investigations in outer space have revealed not only how life adapts to the space environment, but also that interesting biophysical phenomena occur. these phenomena affect human health and other life forms (animals, plants, bacteria, and fungi), and to ensure the safety of future human space exploration need to be further investigated. this calls for joint research efforts between biologists and physicists, as these phenomena present cross-disciplinary barriers. various national organizations provide useful forums for bridging this gap. additional discussion avenues and database resources are helpful for facilitating the interdisciplinary investigations of these phenomena. in this paper, we present the newly established space life investigation database (spacelid, https://bidd.group/spacelid/) which provides information about biophysical phenomena occurring in space. examples obtained using the database are given while discussing the underlying causes of these phenomena and their implications for the physiology and health of life in space.",AB_0221
"backgroundmetagenomic sequencing is an unbiased approach that can potentially detect all the known and unidentified strains in pathogen detection. recently, nanopore sequencing has been emerging as a highly potential tool for rapid pathogen detection due to its fast turnaround time. however, identifying pathogen within species is nontrivial for nanopore sequencing data due to the high sequencing error rate.resultswe developed the core gene alleles metagenome strain identification (cgmsi) tool, which uses a two-stage maximum a posteriori probability estimation method to detect pathogens at strain level from nanopore metagenomic sequencing data at low computational cost. the cgmsi tool can accurately identify strains and estimate relative abundance at 1x coverage.conclusionswe developed cgmsi for nanopore metagenomic pathogen detection within species. cgmsi is available at https://github.com/zhu-xu-xmu/cgmsi.",AB_0221
"background: with the significant reduction in the cost of high-throughput sequencing technology, genomic selection technology has been rapidly developed in the field of plant breeding. although numerous genomic selection methods have been proposed by researchers, the existing genomic selection methods still face the problem of poor prediction accuracy in practical applications. results: this paper proposes a genome prediction method msxfgp based on a multi-strategy improved sparrow search algorithm (ssa) to optimize xgboost parameters and feature selection. firstly, logistic chaos mapping, elite learning, adaptive parameter adjustment, levy flight, and an early stop strategy are incorporated into the ssa. this integration serves to enhance the global and local search capabilities of the algorithm, thereby improving its convergence accuracy and stability. subsequently, the improved ssa is utilized to concurrently optimize xgboost parameters and feature selection, leading to the establishment of a new genomic selection method, msxfgp. utilizing both the coefficient of determination r-2 and the pearson correlation coefficient as evaluation metrics, msxfgp was evaluated against six existing genomic selection models across six datasets. the findings reveal that msxfgp prediction accuracy is comparable or better than existing widely used genomic selection methods, and it exhibits better accuracy when r-2 is utilized as an assessment metric. additionally, this research provides a user-friendly python utility designed to aid breeders in the effective application of this innovative method. msxfgp is accessible at https://github.com/ dibreeding/msxfgp. conclusions: the experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of msxfgp is comparable or better than existing genome selection methods, providing a new approach for plant genome selection.",AB_0221
"'esophageal cancer' (ec) is a highly aggressive and deadly complex disease. it comprises two types, esophageal adenocarcinoma (eac) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (escc), with barrett's esophagus (be) being the only known precursor. recent research has revealed that micrornas (mirnas) play a crucial role in the development, prognosis and treatment of ec and are involved in various human diseases. biological databases have become essential for cancer research as they provide information on genes, proteins, pathways and their interactions. these databases collect, store and manage large amounts of molecular data, which can be used to identify patterns, predict outcomes and generate hypotheses. however, no comprehensive database exists for ec and mirna relationships. to address this gap, we developed a dynamic database named 'esomir (mirna in esophageal cancer) (https://esomir.dqweilab-sjtu.com)', which includes information about targeted genes and mirnas associated with ec. the database uses analysis and prediction methods, including experimentally endorsed mirna(s) information. esomir is a user-friendly interface that allows easy access to ec-associated data by searching for mirnas, target genes, sequences, chromosomal positions and associated signaling pathways. the search modules are designed to provide specific data access to users based on their requirements. additionally, the database provides information about network interactions, signaling pathways and region information of chromosomes associated with the 3modifier letter primeuntranslated region (3modifier letter primeutr) or 5modifier letter primeutr and exon sites. users can also access energy levels of specific mirnas with targeted genes. a fuzzy term search is included in each module to enhance the ease of use for researchers. esomir can be a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians to gain insight into ec, including identifying biomarkers and treatments for this aggressive tumor.database url https://esomir.dqweilab-sjtu.com",AB_0221
"motivation: the outbreak of the human coronavirus (sars-cov-2) has placed a huge burden on public health and the world economy. compared with de novo drug discovery, drug repurposing is a promising therapeutic strategy that facilitates rapid clinical treatment decisions, shortens the development process, and reduces costs. results: in this study, we propose a weighted hypergraph learning and adaptive inductive matrix completion method, whaimc, for predicting potential virus-drug associations. firstly, we integrate multi-source data to describe viruses and drugs from multiple perspectives, including drug chemical structures, drug targets, virus complete genome sequences, and virus-drug associations. then, whaimc establishes an adaptive inductive matrix completion model to improve performance through adaptive learning of similarity relations. finally, whaimc introduces weighted hypergraph learning into adaptive inductive matrix completion to capture higherorder relationships of viruses (or drugs). the results showed that whaimc had a strong predictive performance for new virus-drug associations, new viruses, and new drugs. the case study further demonstrates that whaimc is highly effective for repositioning antiviral drugs against sars-cov-2 and provides a new perspective for virusdrug association prediction. the code and data in this study is freely available at https://github.com/ma yingjun20179/whaimc.",AB_0221
"cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-em) captures snapshots of dynamic macromolecules, collectively illustrating the involved structural landscapes. this provides an exciting opportunity to explore the structural variations of macromolecules under study. however, traditional cryo-em single-particle analysis often yields static structures. here we describe opus-dsd, an algorithm capable of efficiently reconstructing the structural landscape embedded in cryo-em data. opus-dsd uses a three-dimensional convolutional encoder-decoder architecture trained with cryo-em images, thereby encoding structural variations into a smooth and easily analyzable low-dimension space. this space can be traversed to reconstruct continuous dynamics or clustered to identify distinct conformations. opus-dsd can offer meaningful insights into the structural variations of macromolecules, filling in the gaps left by traditional cryo-em structural determination, and potentially improves the reconstruction resolution by reliably clustering similar particles within the dataset. these functionalities are especially relevant to the study of highly dynamic biological systems. opus-dsd is available at https://github.com/alncat/opusdsd. opus-dsd is a neural network-based algorithm that reconstructs distinct conformations or continuous dynamics of the macromolecular structural landscape, starting from single-particle cryo-em data.",AB_0221
"in terms of increasing privacy issues, federated learning (fl) has received extensive attention in medical imaging. through collaborative training, fl can produce superior diagnostic models with global knowledge, while preserving private data locally. in practice, medical diagnosis suffers from intra-/inter-observer vari-ability, thus label noise is inevitable in dataset preparation. different from existing studies on centralized datasets, the label noise problem in fl scenarios confronts more challenges, due to data inaccessibility and even noise heterogeneity. in this work, we propose a federated framework with joint graph purification (fedgp) to address the label noise in fl through server and clients collaboration. specifically, to overcome the impact of label noise on local training, we first devise a noisy graph purification on the client side to generate reliable pseudo labels by progressively expanding the purified graph with topological knowledge. then, we further propose a graph-guided negative ensemble loss to exploit the topology of the client-side purified graph with robust complementary supervision against label noise. moreover, to address the fl label noise with data silos, we propose a global centroid aggregation on the server side to produce a robust classifier with global knowledge, which can be optimized collaboratively in the fl framework. extensive experiments are conducted on endoscopic and pathological images with the comparison under the homogeneous, heterogeneous, and real -world label noise for medical fl. among these diverse noisy fl settings, our fedgp framework significantly outperforms denoising and noisy fl state-of-the-arts by a large margin. the source code is available at https://github.com/cuhk-aim-group/fedgp.",AB_0221
