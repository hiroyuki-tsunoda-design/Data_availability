"motivation technical errors in sequencing or bioinformatics steps and difficulties in alignment at some genomic sites result in false positive (fp) variants. filtering based on quality metrics is a common method for detecting fp variants, but setting thresholds to reduce fp rates may reduce the number of true positive variants by overlooking the more complex relationships between features. the goal of this study is to develop a machine learning-based model for identifying fps that integrates quality metrics with genomic features and with the feature interpretability property to provide insights into model results.results we propose a random forest-based model that utilizes genomic features to improve identification of fps. further examination of the features shows that the newly introduced features have an important impact on the prediction of variants misclassified by vef, gatk-cnn, and garfield, recently introduced fp detection systems. we applied cost-sensitive training to avoid errors in misclassification of true variants and developed a model that provides a robust mechanism against misclassification of true variants while increasing the prediction rate of fp variants. this model can be easily re-trained when factors such as experimental protocols might alter the fp distribution. in addition, it has an interpretability mechanism that allows users to understand the impact of features on the model's predictions.availability and implementation the software implementation can be found at https://github.com/ideateknoloji/fpdetect.",AB_0527
"a hybrid unet and transformer (hut) network is introduced to combine the merits of the unet and transformer architectures, improving brain lesion segmentation from mri and ct scans. the hut overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches by utilizing two parallel stages: one based on unet and the other on transformers. the transformer-based stage captures global dependencies and long-range correlations. it uses intermediate feature vectors from the unet decoder and improves segmentation accuracy by enhancing the attention and relationship modeling between voxel patches derived from the 3d brain volumes. in addition, hut incorporates self-supervised learning on the transformer network. this allows the transformer network to learn by maintaining consistency between the classification layers of the different resolutions of patches and augmentations. there is an improvement in the rate of convergence of the training and the overall capability of segmentation. experimental results on benchmark datasets, including atlas and isles2018, demonstrate hut's advantage over the state-of-the-art methods. hut achieves higher dice scores and reduced hausdorff distance scores in single-modality and multi-modality lesion segmentation. hut outperforms the state-the-art network spin in the single-modality mri segmentation on anatomical tracings of lesion after stroke (atlas) dataset by 4.84% of dice score and a large margin of 40.7% in the hausdorff distance score. hut also performed well on ct perfusion brain scans in the ischemic stroke lesion segmentation (isles2018) dataset and demonstrated an improvement over the recent state-of-the-art network usslnet by 3.3% in the dice score and 12.5% in the hausdorff distance score. with the analysis of both single and multi-modalities datasets (atlasr12 and isles2018), we show that hut can perform and generalize well on different datasets.code is available at: https://github.com/vicsohntu/hut_ct.",AB_0527
"this study aims to develop and validate a modeling framework to predict long-term weight change on the basis of self-reported weight data. the aim is to enable focusing resources of health systems on individuals that are at risk of not achieving their goals in weight loss interventions, which would help both health professionals and the individuals in weight loss management. the weight loss prediction models were built on 327 participants, aged 21-78, from a finnish weight coaching cohort, with at least 9 months of self-reported follow-up weight data during weight loss intervention. with these data, we used six machine learning methods to predict weight loss after 9 months and selected the best performing models for implementation as modeling framework. we trained the models to predict either three classes of weight change (weight loss, insufficient weight loss, weight gain) or five classes (high/moderate/insufficient weight loss, high/low weight gain). finally, the prediction accuracy was validated with an independent cohort of overweight uk adults (n = 184). of the six tested modeling approaches, logistic regression performed the best. most three-class prediction models achieved prediction accuracy of > 50% already with half a month of data and up to 97% with 8 months. the five-class prediction models achieved accuracies from 39% (0.5 months) to 89% (8 months). our approach provides an accurate prediction method for long-term weight loss, with potential for easier and more efficient management of weight loss interventions in the future. a web application is available: https://elolab.shinyapps.io/weightchangepredictor/.",AB_0527
"numerous biological environments have been characterized with the advent of metagenomic sequencing using next generation sequencing which lays out the relative abundance values of microbial taxa. modeling the human microbiome using machine learning models has the potential to identify microbial biomarkers and aid in the diagnosis of a variety of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, colorectal cancer, and many others. the goal of this study is to develop an effective classification model for the analysis of metagenomic datasets associated with different diseases. in this way, we aim to identify taxonomic biomarkers associated with these diseases and facilitate disease diagnosis. the microbiomegsm tool presented in this work incorporates the pre-existing taxonomy information into a machine learning approach and challenges to solve the classification problem in metagenomics disease-associated datasets. based on the g-s-m (grouping-scoring-modeling) approach, species level information is used as features and classified by relating their taxonomic features at different levels, including genus, family, and order. using four different disease associated metagenomics datasets, the performance of microbiomegsm is comparatively evaluated with other feature selection methods such as fast correlation based filter (fcbf), select k best (skb), extreme gradient boosting (xgb), conditional mutual information maximization (cmim), maximum likelihood and minimum redundancy (mrmr) and information gain (ig), also with other classifiers such as adaboost, decision tree, logitboost and random forest. microbiomegsm achieved the highest results with an area under the curve (auc) value of 0.98% at the order taxonomic level for ibdmd dataset. another significant output of microbiomegsm is the list of taxonomic groups that are identified as important for the disease under study and the names of the species within these groups. the association between the detected species and the disease under investigation is confirmed by previous studies in the literature. the microbiomegsm tool and other supplementary files are publicly available at: https://github.com/malikyousef/microbiomegsm.",AB_0527
"background myrtus communis l. (mc) has been used in mesopotamian medicine. here, the cholinesterase (che) inhibitory potential of its methyl alcohol extracts has been investigated and computationally dissected.method the che inhibition has been measured based on usual ellman's colorimetric method compared to a canonical che inhibitor, eserine. through a deep text mining, the structures of phytocompounds (= ligands) of mc were curated from chemspider, pubchem, and zinc databases and docked into protein targets, ache (pdb 1eve) and bche (pdb 1p0i) after initial in silico preparedness and binding affinity (ba; kcal/mol) reported as an endpoint. the calculation of admet (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) features of phytocompounds were retrieved from swissadme (http://www.swissadme.ch/) and admetsar software to predict the drug-likeness or lead-likeness fitness. the toxtree v2.5.1, software platforms (http://toxtree.sourceforge.net/) have been used to predict the class of toxicity of phytocompounds. the stitch platform (http://stitch.embl.de) has been employed to predict che-chemicals interactions.results the possible inhibitory activities of ache of extracts of leaves and berries were 37.33 and 70.00%, respectively as compared to that of eserine while inhibitory bche activities of extracts of leaves and berries of mc were 19.00 and 50.67%, respectively as compared to that of eserine. phytochemicals of mc had ba towards ache ranging from -7.1 (carvacrol) to -9.9 (ellagic acid) kcal/mol. in this regard, alpha-bulnesene, (z)-gamma-bisabolene, and beta-bourbonene were top-listed low toxic binders of ache, and (z)-gamma-bisabolene was a more specific ache binder. alpha-cadinol, estragole, humulene epoxide ii, (a)esculin, ellagic acid, patuletin, juniper camphor, linalyl anthranilate, and spathulenol were high class (class iii) toxic substances which among others, patuletin and alpha-cadinol were more specific ache binders. among intermediate class (class ii) toxic substances, beta-chamigrene was a more specific ache binder while semimyrtucommulone and myrtucommulone a were more specific bche binders.conclusion in sum, the ache binders derived from mc were categorized mostly as antiinsectants (e.g., patuletin and alpha-cardinal) due to their predicted toxic classes. it seems that structural amendment and stereoselective synthesis like adding sulphonate or sulphamate groups to these phytocompounds may make them more suitable candidates for considering in preclinical investigations of alzheimer's disease.",AB_0527
"according to research, it has been suggested that individuals who are affected by depression could potentially engage in the creation and experience emotional advantages relating to positive events directed towards the past or future, with the condition that they are provided with suitable mental imagery techniques. the main aim of this study was to assess the impact of utilizing positive imagery, specifically through the utilization of photographs featuring loved ones, on mood states and suicidal ideation among individuals diagnosed with depression and exhibiting suicidal tendencies. this randomized, double-blind, controlled crossover trial was conducted among 78 hospitalized depressive patients at three psychiatric services between april and august 2019. the patients participated in four individual picture-viewing sessions on four consecutive days. the four categories of pictures were included: loved ones, neutral faces of strangers, natural landscapes, and optical illusions. directly prior to and immediately following the observation of the visual stimuli (photographs), the brunel mood scale (brums) and the beck scale for suicide ideation (bssi) were completed by the patients. repeated measures anovas conducted in this study revealed a significant main effect of time on ratings of tension, depression, fatigue, vigor, calmness, and happiness (p values < 0.001). additionally, statistically significant interactions were identified between picture category and time in relation to the variables of tension, depression, fatigue, vigor, calmness, and happiness (p values < 0.001). the analysis did not reveal a significant main effect of time on ratings of anger, confusion, and suicidal ideation (p values > 0.05). likewise, the interaction between picture category and time did not yield significant results for the variables of anger, confusion, and suicidal ideation (p values > 0.05). the positive imagery procedure using the presentation of loved ones' photos showed beneficial effects on the mood states of depressed patients. the findings of this study suggest that incorporating a greater emphasis on positive imagery within the context of clinical depression may offer potential advantages. this highlights the potential for novel opportunities in the treatment of depression. trial registration: the study has been registered in the iranian registry of clinical trials (registration number: irct20180808040744n1; first registration date: december 22, 2018; website: https://en.irct.ir/trial/33186).",AB_0527
"introductiondespite the high prevalence and detrimental consequences of cognitive and executive dysfunction in adhd, the evidence base of cognitive remediation in the adult adhd population is sparse. executive problems can increase both anxiety and depression in adhd. thcus, it is important to develop treatment options for adults with adhd, aiming to improve goal-directed behavior and mood. goal management training (gmt) is an intervention that has received empirical support in improving executive functions and mood in normal aging and for various neurological and psychiatric conditions. the present randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of a goal-focused intervention combining 1) group-based gmt incorporating psychoeducation about adhd and 2) guidance in implementing individual goals for coping with executive problems in everyday life, compared to treatment as usual (tau). the primary outcome was perceived executive functioning in everyday life. secondary outcomes included psychological well-being (anxiety, depression, and coping with adhd symptoms).methodswe recruited 81 adult participants with a verified adhd diagnosis (mage = 31 years). inclusion was based upon the presence of executive functioning complaints. the participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or tau. the intervention group (n = 41) received 16 hours of gmt and psychoeducation, in addition to 4 individual sessions focusing on formulating goals. the goals were assessed in 6 bi-weekly phone calls in the first three months following the group sessions. participants in the tau group (n = 40) received standard, individually-adapted follow-up in an outpatient psychiatric health care setting. all participants were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and at 8-month follow-up (main measurement time point).resultssignificant improvements in everyday executive functioning, psychological wellbeing, and symptoms of adhd from baseline to 8-month follow-up were reported in both groups. the intervention group reported a significantly higher reduction in symptoms of anxiety compared to tau. conclusions. our findings provide support for considering cognitive remediation as a treatment option for patients with adhd.clinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/nct04638283?term=nct04638283&rank=1, identifier: nct04638283.resultssignificant improvements in everyday executive functioning, psychological wellbeing, and symptoms of adhd from baseline to 8-month follow-up were reported in both groups. the intervention group reported a significantly higher reduction in symptoms of anxiety compared to tau. conclusions. our findings provide support for considering cognitive remediation as a treatment option for patients with adhd.clinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/nct04638283?term=nct04638283&rank=1, identifier: nct04638283.",AB_0527
"backgroundan organised cervical cancer screening programme (occsp) was started in poland in 2006/2007. each woman aged 25 to 59 is eligible for a free pap test every 3 years in occsp. despite implementation of the occsp, the age-standardised cervical cancer (cc) incidence and mortality rates in 2019 were 7.3/100 000 and 3.9/100 000 respectively and were still higher than those in western european countries with well-organised screening programmes. apart from low coverage of the occsp, suboptimal performance of the screening test (conventional cytology) may be partially responsible for this situation. several countries have already incorporated high risk human papillomavirus (hrhpv) testing in cc screening as a more sensitive tool reducing the risk of missing precancerous lesions and allowing for extension of screening intervals. the european guidelines for quality assurance in cervical cancer screening recommend pilot evaluation of a new screening test in country-specific conditions before its implementation.methodsthe hippo project (hpv testing in polish population-based cervical cancer screening program) is a randomised health services study nested in the occsp in poland. the project will randomise 33 000 women aged 30-59 years to cytology or hrhpv testing (ratio: 1:1) with age stratification. in the cytology arm women with repeated atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (asc-us) or >= low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (lsil) are referred for colposcopy. in the other arm, hrhpv ( +) women with >= asc-us reflex liquid-based cytology (lbc) are referred for colposcopy. primary endpoints include detection rates of histologically confirmed high grade intraepithelial lesions or worse (cin2 +) in each arm.discussionthis pilot randomised healthcare study nested in the occsp in poland will assess and compare the performance of hrhpv testing to current standard-cytology in order to make decisions on implementation of hpv-based screening in the country.trial registrationthis randomised healthcare service study was prospectively registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ (identifier: nct04111835, protocol id 28/2019) on 19th of september 2019.",AB_0527

"drug failure during experimental procedures due to low bioactivity presents a significant challenge. to mitigate this risk and enhance compound bioactivities, predicting bioactivity classes during lead optimization is essential. the existing studies on structure-activity relationships have highlighted the connection between the chemical structures of compounds and their bioactivity. however, these studies often overlook the intricate relationship between drugs and bioactivity, which encompasses multiple factors beyond the chemical structure alone. to address this issue, we propose the bioact-het model, employing a heterogeneous siamese neural network to model the complex relationship between drugs and bioactivity classes, bringing them into a unified latent space. in particular, we introduce a novel representation for the bioactivity classes, called bio-prof, and enhance the original bioactivity data sets to tackle data scarcity. these innovative approaches resulted in our model outperforming the previous ones. the evaluation of bioact-het is conducted through three distinct strategies: association-based, bioactivity class-based, and compound-based. the association-based strategy utilizes supervised learning classification, while the bioactivity class-based strategy adopts a retrospective study evaluation approach. on the other hand, the compound-based strategy demonstrates similarities to the concept of meta-learning. furthermore, the model's effectiveness in addressing real-world problems is analyzed through a case study on the application of vancomycin and oseltamivir for covid-19 treatment as well as molnupiravir's potential efficacy in treating covid-19 patients. the data and code underlying this article are available on https://github.com/cbrc-lab/bioact-het. however, data sets were derived from sources in the public domain.",AB_0527
