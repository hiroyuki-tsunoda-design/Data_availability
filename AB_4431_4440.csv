"in 2019, we released missense3d which identifies stereochemical features that are disrupted by a missense variant, such as introducing a buried charge. missense3d analyses the effect of a missense variant on a single structure and thus may fail to identify as damaging surface variants disrupting a protein interface i.e., a protein-protein interaction (ppi) site. here we present missense3d-ppi designed to predict missense variants at ppi interfaces. our development dataset comprised of 1,279 missense variants (pathogenic n = 733, benign n = 546) in 434 proteins and 545 experimental structures of ppi complexes. benchmarking of missense3d-ppi was performed after dividing the dataset in training (320 benign and 320 pathogenic variants) and testing (226 benign and 413 pathogenic). structural features affecting ppi, such as disruption of interchain bonds and introduction of unbalanced charged interface residues, were analysed to assess the impact of the variant at ppi. the performance of missense3d-ppi was superior to that of missense3d: sensitivity 44 % versus 8% and accuracy 58% versus 40%, p = 4.23 x 10(-16). however, the specificity of missense3d-ppi was lower compared to missense3d (84% versus 98%). on our dataset, missense3d-ppi's accuracy was superior to beatmusic (p = 3.4 x 10(-5)), mcsm-ppi2 (p = 1.5 x 10(-12)) and mutabind2 (p = 0.0025). missense3d-ppi represents a valuable tool for predicting the structural effect of missense variants on biological protein networks and is available at the missense3d web portal (http://missense3d.bc.ic.ac.uk).(c) 2023 the authors. published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0444
"the enzyme function initiative (efi) provides a web resource with genomic enzymology web tools to leverage the protein (uniprot) and genome (european nucleotide archive; ena; https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ ena/) databases to assist the assignment of in vitro enzymatic activities and in vivo metabolic functions to uncharacterized enzymes (https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/). the tools enable (1) exploration of sequence -function space in enzyme families using sequence similarity networks (ssns; efi-est), (2) easy access to genome context for bacterial, archaeal, and fungal proteins in the ssn clusters so that isofunctional families can be identified and their functions inferred from genome context (efi-gnt); and (3) determina-tion of the abundance of ssn clusters in nih human metagenome project metagenomes using chemi-cally guided functional profiling (efi-cgfp). we describe enhancements that enable ssns to be generated from taxonomy categories, allowing higher resolution analyses of sequence-function space; we provide examples of the generation of taxonomy category-specific ssns.& copy; 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0444
"background: covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is associated with heightened risks of venous and arterial thrombosis and hospitalization due to respiratory failure. to assess whether prophylactic anticoagulation can safely reduce the frequency of venous and arterial thrombosis, hospitalization, and death in nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic covid-19 and at least one thrombosis risk factor, we conducted the prevent-hd double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial (a study of rivaroxaban to reduce the risk of major venous and arterial thrombotic events, hospitalization and death in medically ill outpatients with acute, symptomatic covid-19] infection). methods: prevent-hd was conducted between august 2020 and april 2022 at 14 us integrated health care delivery networks. a virtual trial design used remote informed consent and clinical monitoring and facilitated data collection through electronic health record integration with a cloud-based research platform. nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic covid-19 and at least one thrombosis risk factor were enrolled and randomly assigned to either 10 mg of oral rivaroxaban or placebo daily for 35 days. the primary efficacy outcome was time to first occurrence of a composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, non-central nervous system systemic arterial embolism, hospitalization, or death through day 35. the principal safety end point was international society on thrombosis and hemostasis critical-site or fatal bleeding. the last study visit was on day 49. results: the study was terminated prematurely because of enrollment challenges and a lower-than-expected blinded pooled event rate. a total of 1284 patients underwent randomization with complete accrual of primary events through may 2022. no patients were lost to follow-up. the primary efficacy outcome occurred in 22 of 641 in the rivaroxaban group and 19 of 643 in the placebo group (3.4% versus 3.0%; hazard ratio, 1.16 [95% ci, 0.63-2.15]; p=0.63). no patient in either group experienced critical-site or fatal bleeding. one patient receiving rivaroxaban had a major bleed. conclusions: the study was terminated prematurely after enrollment of 32% of planned accrual because of recruitment challenges and lower-than-expected event rate. rivaroxaban prescribed for 35 days in nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic covid-19 at risk for thrombosis did not appear to reduce a composite end point of venous and arterial thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death. registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct04508023.",AB_0444
"motivation: the generation of parameter files for molecular dynamics (md) simulations of small molecules that are suitable for force fields commonly applied to proteins and nucleic acids is often challenging. the acpype software and website aid the generation of such parameter files.results: acpype uses openbabel and antechamber to generate md input files in gromacs, amber, charmm, and cns formats. it can now take a smiles string as input, in addition to the original pdb or mol2 coordinate files, with gaff2 support and glycam force field conversion added. it can be installed locally via anaconda, pypi, and docker distributions, while the web server at https://bio2byte.be/acpype/ was updated with an api, and provides visualization of results for uploaded molecules as well as a pre-generated set of 3738 drug molecules.",AB_0444
"background: lung function decline varies significantly in patients with lymphangioleio-myomatosis (lam), impeding individualized clinical decision-making.research question: can we aid individualized decision-making in lam by developing a dynamic prediction model that can estimate the probability of clinically relevant fev1 decline in patients with lam before treatment initiation?study design and methods: patients observed in the us national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) lymphangioleiomyomatosis registry were included. using routinely available variables such as age at diagnosis, menopausal status, and baseline lung function (fev1 and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide [dlco]), we used novel stochastic modeling and evaluated predictive probabilities for clinically relevant drops in fev1. we formed predictive probabilities of transplant-free survival by jointly modeling longitudinal fev1 and lung transplantation or death events. external validation used the uk lymphangioleiomyomatosis natural history cohort.results: analysis of the nhlbi lymphangioleiomyomatosis registry and uk lym-phangioleiomyomatosis natural history cohorts consisted of 216 and 185 individuals, respectively. we derived a joint model that accurately estimated the risk of future lung function decline and 5-year probabilities of transplant-free survival in patients with lam not taking sirolimus (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [auc], approxi-mately 0.80). the prediction model provided estimates of forecasted fev1, rate of fev1 decline, and probabilities for risk of prolonged drops in fev1 for untreated patients with lam with a high degree of accuracy (auc > 0.80) for the derivation cohort as well as the validation cohort. our tool is freely accessible at: https://anushkapalipana.shinyapps.io/ testapp_v2/.interpretation: longitudinal modeling of routine clinical data can allow individualized lam prognostication and assist in decision-making regarding the timing of treatment initiation. chest 2023; 163(6):1458-1470",AB_0444
"backgroundpatient-derived xenograft (pdx) models involve the engraftment of tumour tissue in immunocompromised mice and represent an important pre-clinical oncology research method. a limitation of non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) pdx model derivation in nod-scid il2rgamma(null) (nsg) mice is that a subset of initial engraftments are of lymphocytic, rather than tumour origin. methodsthe immunophenotype of lymphoproliferations arising in the lung tracerx pdx pipeline were characterised. to present the histology data herein, we developed a python-based tool for generating patient-level pathology overview figures from whole-slide image files; pathoverview is available on github (https://github.com/epicentr-lab/pathoverview). resultslymphoproliferations occurred in 17.8% of lung adenocarcinoma and 10% of lung squamous cell carcinoma transplantations, despite none of these patients having a prior or subsequent clinical history of lymphoproliferative disease. lymphoproliferations were predominantly human cd20+ b cells and had the immunophenotype expected for post-transplantation diffuse large b cell lymphoma with plasma cell features. all lymphoproliferations expressed epstein-barr-encoded rnas (eber). analysis of immunoglobulin light chain gene rearrangements in three tumours where multiple tumour regions had resulted in lymphoproliferations suggested that each had independent clonal origins. discussionoverall, these data suggest that b cell clones with lymphoproliferative potential are present within primary nsclc tumours, and that these are under continuous immune surveillance. since these cells can be expanded following transplantation into nsg mice, our data highlight the value of quality control measures to identify lymphoproliferations within xenograft pipelines and support the incorporation of strategies to minimise lymphoproliferations during the early stages of xenograft establishment pipelines.",AB_0444
"background the crosstalk between cancer and the tumour immune microenvironment ( time) has attracted significant interest in the latest years because of its impact on cancer evolution and response to treatment. despite this, cancer-specific tumour-time interactions and their mechanistic insights are still poorly understood. methods here, we compute the significant interactions occurring between cancer-specific genetic drivers and five anti- and pro-tumour time features in 32 cancer types using lasso regularised ordinal regression. focusing on head and neck squamous cancer (hnsc), we rebuild the functional networks linking specific time driver alterations to the time state they associate with. results the 477 time drivers that we identify are multifunctional genes whose alterations are selected early in cancer evolution and recur across and within cancer types. tumour suppressors and oncogenes have an opposite effect on the time and the overall anti-tumour time driver burden is predictive of response to immunotherapy. time driver alterations predict the immune profiles of hnsc molecular subtypes, and perturbations in keratinization, apoptosis and interferon signalling underpin specific driver-time interactions. conclusions overall, our study delivers a comprehensive resource of time drivers, gives mechanistic insights into their immune-regulatory role, and provides an additional framework for patient prioritisation to immunotherapy. the full list of time drivers and associated properties are available at http://www.network-.cancer-.genes.org.",AB_0444
"background: stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (storm), a super-resolution microscopy technique based on single-molecule localizations, has become popular to characterize sub-diffraction limit targets. however, due to lengthy image acquisition, storm recordings are prone to sample drift. existing cross-correlation or fiducial marker-based algorithms allow correcting the drift within each channel, but misalignment between channels remains due to interchannel drift accumulating during sequential channel acquisition. this is a major drawback in multi-color storm, a technique of utmost importance for the characterization of various biological interactions. results: we developed registorm, a software for reducing channel misalignment by accurately registering storm channels utilizing fiducial markers in the sample. registorm identifies fiducials from the storm localization data based on their non-blinking nature and uses them as landmarks for channel registration. we first demonstrated accurate registration on recordings of fiducials only, as evidenced by significantly reduced target registration error with all the tested channel combinations. next, we validated the performance in a more practically relevant setup on cells multi-stained for tubulin. finally, we showed that registorm successfully registers two-color storm recordings of cargo-loaded lipid nanoparticles without fiducials, demonstrating the broader applicability of this software. conclusions: the developed registorm software was demonstrated to be able to accurately register multiple storm channels and is freely available as open-source (mit license) at https://github.com/oystein676/registorm.git and  zenodo.5509861 (archived), and runs as a standalone executable (windows) or via python (mac os, linux).",AB_0444
"upcoming large-scale structure surv e ys will measure the matter power spectrum to approximately per cent level accuracy with the aim of searching for evidence for new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology. in order to a v oid biasing our conclusions, the theoretical predictions need to be at least as accurate as the measurements for a given choice of cosmological parameters. ho we ver, recent theoretical work has shown that complex physical processes associated with galaxy formation (particularly energetic feedback processes associated with stars and especially supermassive black holes) can alter the predictions by many times larger than the required accuracy. here we present sp(k) , a model for the effects of baryon physics on the non-linear matter power spectrum based on a new large suite of hydrodynamical simulations. specifically, the antilles suite consists of 400 simulations spanning a very wide range of the feedback landscape' and show that the effects of baryons on the matter power spectrum can be understood at approaching the per cent level in terms of the mean baryon fraction of haloes, at scales of up to k less than or similar to 10 h mpc (-1) and redshifts up to z = 3. for the range of scales and redshifts that will be probed by forthcoming cosmic shear measurements, most of the effects are driven by galaxy group mass haloes (m similar to 10 (13-14) m-circle dot). we present a simple python implementation of our model, available at https://github.com/jemme07/pyspk, which can be used to incorporate baryon effects in standard gravity-only predictions, allowing for marginalization o v er baryon physics within cosmological pipelines.",AB_0444
"in 2019 november, we began operating finding luminous and exotic extragalactic transients (fleet), a machine-learning algorithm designed to photometrically identify type i superluminous supernovae (slsne) in transient alert streams. through this observational campaign, we spectroscopically classified 21 of the 50 slsne identified worldwide between 2019 november and 2022 january. based on our original algorithm, we anticipated that fleet would achieve a purity of about 50% for transients with a probability of being an slsn, p(slsn-i) > 0.5; the true on-sky purity we obtained is closer to 80%. similarly, we anticipated fleet could reach a completeness of about 30%, and we indeed measure an upper limit on the completeness of less than or similar to 33%. here we present fleet 2.0, an updated version of fleet trained on 4780 transients (almost three times more than fleet 1.0). fleet 2.0 has a similar predicted purity to fleet 1.0 but outperforms fleet 1.0 in terms of completeness, which is now closer to approximate to 40% for transients with p(slsn-i) > 0.5. additionally, we explore the possible systematics that might arise from the use of fleet for target selection. we find that the population of slsne recovered by fleet is mostly indistinguishable from the overall slsn population in terms of physical and most observational parameters. we provide fleet as an open source package on github:.https://github.com/gmzsebastian/fleet.",AB_0444
