"the purpose of our study was to explore potential characteristic biomarkers in patients with sepsis. peripheral blood specimens from sepsis patients and normal human volunteers were processed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based analysis. outlier data were excluded by principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis using the metabolomics r software package metax and metaboanalyst 5.0 (https:// www. metab oanal yst. ca/ home. xhtml) online analysis software, and differential metabolite counts were identified by using volcano and heatmaps. the obtained differential metabolites were combined with kegg (kyoto gene and kyoto encyclopedia) analysis to screen out potential core differential metabolites, and roc curves were drawn to analyze the changes in serum metabolites in sepsis patients and to explore the potential value of the metabolites in the diagnosis of sepsis patients. by metabolomic analysis, nine differential metabolites were screened for their significance in guiding the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of sepsis namely: 3-phenyl lactic acid, n-phenylacetylglutamine, phenylethylamine, traumatin, xanthine, methyl jasmonate, indole, l-tryptophan and 1107116. in this study, nine metabolites were finally screened based on metabolomic analysis and used as potential characteristic biomarkers for the diagnosis of sepsis.",AB_0264
"the advances in single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scrna-seq) allow researchers to explore cellular heterogeneity and human diseases at cell resolution. cell clustering is a prerequisite in scrna-seq analysis since it can recognize cell identities. however, the high dimensionality, noises and significant sparsity of scrna-seq data have made it a big challenge. although many methods have emerged, they still fail to fully explore the intrinsic properties of cells and the relationship among cells, which seriously affects the downstream clustering performance. here, we propose a new deep contrastive clustering algorithm called scdcca. it integrates a denoising auto encoder and a dual contrastive learning module into a deep clustering framework to extract valuable features and realize cell clustering. specifically, to better characterize and learn data representations robustly, scdcca utilizes a denoising zero-inflated negative binomial model-based auto-encoder to extract low-dimensional features. meanwhile, scdcca incorporates a dual contrastive learning module to capture the pairwise proximity of cells. by increasing the similarities between positive pairs and the differences between negative ones, the contrasts at both the instance and the cluster level help the model learn more discriminative features and achieve better cell segregation. furthermore, scdcca joins feature learning with clustering, which realizes representation learning and cell clustering in an end-to-end manner. experimental results of 14 real datasets validate that scdcca outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, generalizability, scalability and efficiency. cell visualization and biological analysis demonstrate that scdcca significantly improves clustering and facilitates downstream analysis for scrna-seq data. the code is available at https://github.com/wj319/scdcca.",AB_0264
"vaa3d is a software package that has been widely used to visualize and analyze multidimensional microscopic images in a number of cutting edge bioimage informatics applications. however, due to many recent updates of both software development environments and operating systems, it was highly requested to maintain vaa3d and disseminate it on latest operating systems. in addition, there has never been a showcase about how to use vaa3d's cross-platform visualization and immersive exploration functions for multidimensional and teravoxel-scale images. here, we introduce a newly developed version of the software, called vaa3d-x, to address all the above issues. availability and implementation: vaa3d-x is released in both binary and open-source available at vaa3d.org and github (https://github.com/vaa3d). contact: 230218257@seu.edu.cn supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0264
"automatic segmentation of coronary arteries provides vital assistance to enable accurate and efficient diagnosis and evaluation of coronary artery disease (cad). however, the task of coronary artery segmentation (cas) remains highly challenging due to the large-scale variations exhibited by coronary arteries, their complicated anatomical structures and morphologies, as well as the low contrast between vessels and their background. to comprehensively tackle these challenges, we propose a novel multi-attention, multi-scale 3d deep network for cas, which we call cas-net. specifically, we first propose an attention-guided feature fusion (agff) module to efficiently fuse adjacent hierarchical features in the encoding and decoding stages to capture more effectively latent semantic information. then, we propose a scale-aware feature enhancement (safe) module, aiming to dynamically adjust the receptive fields to extract more expressive features effectively, thereby enhancing the feature representation capability of the network. furthermore, we employ the multi-scale feature aggregation (msfa) module to learn a more distinctive semantic representation for refining the vessel maps. in addition, considering that the limited training data annotated with a quality golden standard are also a significant factor restricting the development of cas, we construct a new dataset containing 119 cases consisting of coronary computed tomographic angiography (ccta) volumes and annotated coronary arteries. extensive experiments on our self-collected dataset and three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has good segmentation performance and generalization ability, outperforming multiple state-of-the-art algorithms on various metrics. compared with u-net3d, the proposed method significantly improves the dice similarity coefficient (dsc) by at least 4% on each dataset, due to the synergistic effect among the three core modules, agff, safe, and msfa. our implementation is released at https://github.com/cassie-cv/cas-net.",AB_0264
"gallbladder carcinoma (gbc), an aggressive malignant tumor of the biliary system, is characterized by high cellular heterogeneity and poor prognosis. fewer data have been reported in gbc than other common cancer types. multi-omics data will contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cancer, cancer diagnosis and prognosis. herein, to provide better understanding of the molecular events in gbc pathogenesis, we developed gbcdb (http://tmliang.cn/gbc/), a user-friendly interface for the query and browsing of gbc-associated genes and rna interaction networks using published multi-omics data, which also included experimentally supported data from different molecular levels. gbcdb will help to elucidate the potential biological roles of different rnas and allow for the exploration of rna interactions in gbc. these resources will provide an opportunity for unraveling the potential molecular features of gallbladder carcinoma.",AB_0264
"motivation drug-food interactions (dfis) occur when some constituents of food affect the bioaccessibility or efficacy of the drug by involving in drug pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic processes. many computational methods have achieved remarkable results in link prediction tasks between biological entities, which show the potential of computational methods in discovering novel dfis. however, there are few computational approaches that pay attention to dfi identification. this is mainly due to the lack of dfi data. in addition, food is generally made up of a variety of chemical substances. the complexity of food makes it difficult to generate accurate feature representations for food. therefore, it is urgent to develop effective computational approaches for learning the food feature representation and predicting dfis. results in this article, we first collect dfi data from drugbank and pubmed, respectively, to construct two datasets, named drugbank-dfi and pubmed-dfi. based on these two datasets, two dfi networks are constructed. then, we propose a novel end-to-end graph embedding-based method named dfinder to identify dfis. dfinder combines node attribute features and topological structure features to learn the representations of drugs and food constituents. in topology space, we adopt a simplified graph convolution network-based method to learn the topological structure features. in feature space, we use a deep neural network to extract attribute features from the original node attributes. the evaluation results indicate that dfinder performs better than other baseline methods. availability and implementation the source code is available at https://github.com/23aibox/23aibox-dfinder. contact: jiajiepeng@nwpu.edu.cn supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0264
"motivation: the growing number of microbial reference genomes enables the improvement of metagenomic profiling accuracy but also imposes greater requirements on the indexing efficiency, database size and runtime of taxonomic profilers. additionally, most profilers focus mainly on bacterial, archaeal and fungal populations, while less attention is paid to viral communities. results: we present kmcp (k-mer-based metagenomic classification and profiling), a novel k-mer-based metagenomic profiling tool that utilizes genome coverage information by splitting the reference genomes into chunks and stores k-mers in a modified and optimized compact bit-sliced signature index for fast alignment-free sequence searching. kmcp combines k-mer similarity and genome coverage information to reduce the false positive rate of k-mer-based taxonomic classification and profiling methods. benchmarking results based on simulated and real data demonstrate that kmcp, despite a longer running time than all other methods, not only allows the accurate taxonomic profiling of prokaryotic and viral populations but also provides more confident pathogen detection in clinical samples of low depth. availability and implementation: the software is open-source under the mit license and available at https://github.com/shenwei356/kmcp. contact: shenwei356@cqmu.edu.cn or hp_cq@163.com or hupengcq@hospital.cqmu.edu.cn or renhong0531@cqmu.edu.cn supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0264
"the highly ambiguous nature of boundaries and similar objects is difficult to address in some ultrasound image segmentation tasks, such as neck muscle segmentation, leading to unsatisfactory performance. thus, this paper proposes a two-stage network called sccnet (self-correction context network) using a self-correction boundary preservation module and class-context filter to alleviate these problems. the proposed self-correction boundary preservation module uses a dynamic key boundary point (kbp) map to increase the capability of iteratively discriminating ambiguous boundary points segments, and the predicted segmentation map from one stage is used to obtain a dynamic class prior filter to improve the segmentation performance at stage 2. finally, three datasets, neck muscle, camus and thyroid, are used to demonstrate that our proposed sccnet outperforms other state -of-the art methods, such as bpbnet, dsnnet, and ragcnet. our proposed network shows at least a 1.2-3.7% improvement on the three datasets, neck muscle, thyroid, and camus. the source code is available at https:// github.com/lijixing0425/sccnet.",AB_0264
"during the computed tomography (ct) imaging process, metallic implants within patients often cause harmful artifacts, which adversely degrade the visual quality of reconstructed ct images and negatively affect the subsequent clinical diagnosis. for the metal artifact reduction (mar) task, current deep learning based methods have achieved promising performance. however, most of them share two main common limitations: (1) the ct physical imaging geometry constraint is not comprehensively incorporated into deep network structures; (2) the entire framework has weak interpretability for the specific mar task; hence, the role of each network module is difficult to be evaluated. to alleviate these issues, in the paper, we construct a novel deep unfolding dual domain network, termed indudonet+, into which ct imaging process is finely embedded. concretely, we derive a joint spatial and radon domain reconstruction model and propose an optimization algorithm with only simple operators for solving it. by unfolding the iterative steps involved in the proposed algorithm into the corresponding network modules, we easily build the indudonet+ with clear interpretability. furthermore, we analyze the ct values among different tissues, and merge the prior observations into a prior network for our indudonet+, which significantly improve its generalization performance. comprehensive experiments on synthesized data and clinical data substantiate the superiority of the proposed methods as well as the superior generalization performance beyond the current state-of-the-art (sota) mar methods. code is available at https://github.com/hongwang01/indudonet_plus.",AB_0264
