"background: overweight and obesity are associated with adverse functional outcomes in people with peripheral artery disease (pad). the effects of weight loss in people with overweight/obesity and pad are unknown. methods: the prove (promote weight loss in obese pad patients to prevent mobility loss) trial is a multicentered randomized clinical trial with the primary aim of testing whether a behavioral intervention designed to help participants with pad lose weight and walk for exercise improves 6-minute walk distance at 12-month follow-up, compared with walking exercise alone. a total of 212 participants with pad and body mass index >= 25 kg/m(2) will be randomized. interventions are delivered using a group mediated cognitive behavioral intervention model, a smartphone application, and individual telephone coaching. the primary outcome is 12-month change in 6-minute walk distance. secondary outcomes include total minutes of walking exercise/wk at 12-month follow-up and 12-month change in accelerometer-measured physical activity, the walking impairment questionnaire distance score, and the patient-reported outcomes measurement information system mobility questionnaire. tertiary outcomes include 12-month changes in perceived exertional effort at the end of the 6-minute walk, diet quality, and the short physical performance battery. exploratory outcomes include changes in gastrocnemius muscle biopsy measures of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity, mitochondrial biogenesis, capillary density, and inflammatory markers. conclusions: the prove randomized clinical trial will evaluate the effects of exercise with an intervention of coaching and a smartphone application designed to achieve weight loss, compared with exercise alone, on walking performance in people with pad and overweight/obesity. results will inform optimal treatment for the growing number of patients with pad who have overweight/obesity. registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct04228978.",AB_0603
"motivation model organisms are widely used to better understand the molecular causes of human disease. while sequence similarity greatly aids this cross-species transfer, sequence similarity does not imply functional similarity, and thus, several current approaches incorporate protein-protein interactions to help map findings between species. existing transfer methods either formulate the alignment problem as a matching problem which pits network features against known orthology, or more recently, as a joint embedding problem.results we propose a novel state-of-the-art joint embedding solution: embeddings to network alignment (etna). etna generates individual network embeddings based on network topological structure and then uses a natural language processing-inspired cross-training approach to align the two embeddings using sequence-based orthologs. the final embedding preserves both within and between species gene functional relationships, and we demonstrate that it captures both pairwise and group functional relevance. in addition, etna's embeddings can be used to transfer genetic interactions across species and identify phenotypic alignments, laying the groundwork for potential opportunities for drug repurposing and translational studies.availability and implementation https://github.com/ylaboratory/etna",AB_0603
"motivation single-cell sequencing technology has become a routine in studying many biological problems. a core step of analyzing single-cell data is the assignment of cell clusters to specific cell types. reference-based methods are proposed for predicting cell types for single-cell clusters. however, the scalability and lack of preprocessed reference datasets prevent them from being practical and easy to use.results here, we introduce a reference-based cell annotation web server, cellann, which is super-fast and easy to use. cellann contains a comprehensive reference database with 204 human and 191 mouse single-cell datasets. these reference datasets cover 32 organs. furthermore, we developed a cluster-to-cluster alignment method to transfer cell labels from the reference to the query datasets, which is superior to the existing methods with higher accuracy and higher scalability. finally, cellann is an online tool that integrates all the procedures in cell annotation, including reference searching, transferring cell labels, visualizing results, and harmonizing cell annotation labels. through the user-friendly interface, users can identify the best annotation by cross-validating with multiple reference datasets. we believe that cellann can greatly facilitate single-cell sequencing data analysis.availability and implementation the web server is available at www.cellann.io, and the source code is available at https://github.com/pinlyu3/cellann_shinyapp.",AB_0603
"motivation deep sequencing of antibody and related protein libraries after phage or yeast-surface display sorting is widely used to identify variants with increased affinity, specificity, and/or improvements in key biophysical properties. conventional approaches for identifying optimal variants typically use the frequencies of observation in enriched libraries or the corresponding enrichment ratios. however, these approaches disregard the vast majority of deep sequencing data and often fail to identify the best variants in the libraries.results here, we present a method, position-specific enrichment ratio matrix (pserm) scoring, that uses entire deep sequencing datasets from pre- and post-selections to score each observed protein variant. the pserm scores are the sum of the site-specific enrichment ratios observed at each mutated position. we find that pserm scores are much more reproducible and correlate more strongly with experimentally measured properties than frequencies or enrichment ratios, including for multiple antibody properties (affinity and non-specific binding) for a clinical-stage antibody (emibetuzumab). we expect that this method will be broadly applicable to diverse protein engineering campaigns.availability and implementation all deep sequencing datasets and code to perform the analyses presented within are available via https://github.com/tessier-lab-umich/pserm_paper.",AB_0603
"we have developed an algorithm, parse, which accurately identifies from the primary sequence those protein regions likely to exhibit physiological phase separation behavior. originally, parse was designed to test the hypothesis that, for flexible proteins, phase separation potential is correlated to hydrodynamic size. while our results were consistent with that idea, we also found that many different descriptors could successfully differentiate between three classes of protein regions: folded, intrinsically disordered, and phase-separating intrinsically disordered. consequently, numerous combinations of amino acid property scales can be used to make robust predictions of protein phase separation. built from that finding, parse 2.0 uses an optimal set of property scales to predict domain-level organization and compute a sequence-based prediction of phase separation potential. the algorithm is fast enough to scan the whole of the human proteome in minutes on a single computer and is equally or more accurate than other published predictors in identifying proteins and regions within proteins that drive phase separation. here, we describe a web application for parse 2.0 that may be accessed through a browser by visiting https://stevewhitten.github.io/parse_v2_fasta to quickly identify phase-separating proteins within large sequence sets, or by visiting https:// stevewhitten.github.io/parse_v2_web to evaluate individual protein sequences.",AB_0603
"we propose a cross-internal linear combination (cross-ilc) approach to measure the small-scale cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies robustly against the contamination from astrophysical signals. in particular, we focus on the mitigation of systematics from cosmic infrared background (cib) and thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (tsz) signals in kinematic sunyaev-zel'dovich (ksz) power spectrum and cmb lensing. we show the cross-spectrum measurement between two cmb maps created by nulling the contributions from cib (cib-free map) and tsz (tsz-free map) to be robust for ksz, as the approach significantly suppresses the total contribution of cib and tsz signals. similarly, for cmb lensing, we use the approach introduced by madhavacheril & hill but with a slight modification by using the tsz-free and cib-free maps in the two legs of the quadratic estimator. by cross-correlating the cmb lensing map created using this technique with galaxy surveys, we show that the biases from both cib and tsz are negligible. we also compute the impact of unmodeled cib/tsz residuals on ksz and cosmological parameters, finding the ksz measured using the standard ilc to be significantly biased. the ksz estimate from the cross-ilc remains less affected by cib/tsz, making it crucial for current and upcoming cmb surveys such as the south pole telescope (spt), simons observatory (so), and cmb-s4. with the cross-ilc approach, we find that the total ksz power spectrum can be measured at very high significance in the coming years: 35 sigma by spt, 22 sigma by so, and 80 sigma by cmb-s4. finally, we forecast constraints on the epoch of reionization using the ksz power spectrum and find that the duration of reionization, currently unconstrained by planck, can be constrained to sigma(delta zre) = 1.5 or 0.5 depending on the choice of the prior on the optical depth to reionization. the data products and the associated codes can be downloaded from this link (https://github.com/sriniraghunathan/cross_ilc_methods_paper).",AB_0603
"pedigree data contain family history information that is used to analyze hereditary diseases. these clinical data sets may contain duplicate records due to the same family visiting a clinic multiple times or a clinician entering multiple versions of the family for testing purposes. inferences drawn from the data or using them for training or validation without removing the duplicates could lead to invalid conclusions, and hence identifying the duplicates is essential. since family structures can be complex, direct application of existing deduplication algorithms may not be straightforward. we first motivate the importance of deduplication by examining the impact of pedigree duplicates on model performance when training and validating a familial risk prediction model. we then introduce an unsupervised algorithm, which we call snip (sorted neighborhood for pedigrees), that builds on the sorted neighborhood method to find efficiently and to classify pair comparisons by leveraging the inherent hierarchical nature of the pedigrees. we conduct a simulation study to assess the performance of the algorithm and find parameter configurations where the algorithm is able to accurately detect the duplicates. we then apply the method to data from the risk service, which includes over 300,000 pedigrees at high risk of hereditary cancers, and uncover large clusters of potential duplicate families. after removing 104,520 pedigrees (33% of original data), the resulting risk service data set can now be used for future analysis, training, and validation. the algorithm is available as an r package snipr at https://github.com/bayesmendel/snipr.",AB_0603
"different genes form complex networks within cells to carry out critical cellular functions, while network alterations in this process can potentially introduce downstream transcriptome perturbations and phenotypic variations. therefore, developing efficient and interpretable methods to quantify network changes and pinpoint driver genes across conditions is crucial. we propose a hierarchical graph representation learning method, called iherd. given a set of networks, iherd first hierarchically generates a series of coarsened sub-graphs in a data-driven manner, representing network modules at different resolutions (e.g., the level of signaling pathways). then, it sequentially learns low-dimensional node representations at all hierarchical levels via efficient graph embedding. lastly, iherd projects separate gene embeddings onto the same latent space in its graph alignment module to calculate a rewiring index for driver gene prioritization. to demonstrate its effectiveness, we applied iherd on a tumor-to-normal grn rewiring analysis and cell-type-specific gcn analysis using single-cell multiome data of the brain. we showed that iherd can effectively pinpoint novel and well-known risk genes in different diseases. distinct from existing models, iherd's graph coarsening for hierarchical learning allows us to successfully classify network driver genes into early and late divergent genes (edgs and ldgs), emphasizing genes with extensive network changes across and within signaling pathway levels. this unique approach for driver gene classification can provide us with deeper molecular insights. the code is freely available at https://github.com/aicb-zhanglabs/iherd. all other relevant data are within the manuscript and it supporting information files.",AB_0603
"objective the aim of this study was to discern whether patients with a cranial sagittal vertical axis to the hip (crsva-h) > 2 cm at 2 years postoperatively exhibit significantly worse patient-reported outcomes (pros) and clinical outcomes compared with patients with crsva-h < 2 cm. methods this was a retrospective, 1:1 propensity score- matched (psm) study of patients who underwent posterior spinal fusion for adult spinal deformity. all patients had a baseline sagittal imbalance of crsva-h > 30 mm. two-year patient-reported and clinical outcomes were assessed in unmatched and psm cohorts, including scoliosis research society-22r (srs-22r) and oswestry disability index scores as well as reoperation rates. the study compared two cohorts based on 2-year alignment: crsva- h < 20 mm (aligned cohort) vs crsva-h > 20 mm (malaligned cohort). for the matched cohorts, binary outcome comparisons were carried out using the mcnemar test, while continuous outcomes used the wilcoxon rank-sum test. for unmatched cohorts, categorical variables were compared using chi-square/ fisher's tests, while continuous outcomes were compared using welch's t-test. results a total of 156 patients with mean age of 63.7 (sem 1.09) years underwent posterior spinal fusion spanning a mean of 13.5 (0.32) levels. at baseline, the mean pelvic incidence minus lumbar lordosis mismatch was 19.1 degrees (2.01 degrees), the t1 pelvic angle was 26.6 degrees (1.20 degrees), and the crsva- h was 74.9 (4.33) mm. the mean crsva-h improved from 74.9 mm to 29.2 mm (p < 0.0001). at the 2-year follow- up, 129 (78%) of 164 patients achieved crsva- h < 2 cm (aligned cohort). patients who had crsva-h > 2 cm (malaligned cohort) at the 2-year follow-up had worse preoperative crsva-h (p < 0.0001). after performing psm, 27 matched pairs were generated. in the psm cohort, the aligned and malaligned cohorts demonstrated comparable preoperative patient-reported outcomes (pros). however, at the 2-year postoperative follow-up, the malaligned cohort reported worse outcomes in srs-22r function (p = 0.0275), pain (p = 0.0012), and mean total score (p = 0.0109). moreover, when patients were stratified based on their magnitude of improvement in crsva-h (< 50% vs > 50%), patients with > 50% improvement in crsva- h had superior outcomes in srs-22r function (p = 0.0336), pain (p = 0.0446), and mean total score (p = 0.0416). finally, patients in the malaligned cohort had a higher 2-year reoperation rate (22% vs 7%; p = 0.0412) compared with patients in the aligned cohort. conclusions among patients who present with forward sagittal imbalance (crsva-h > 30 mm), patients with crsva- h exceeding 20 mm at the 2-year postoperative follow-up have inferior pros and higher reoperation rates. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2023.4.spine23303",AB_0603
"study objectives: we evaluated the impact of bed provision and sleep education through the beds for kids (bfk) program on early childhood sleep and behavior and maternal mood and sleep. methods: twenty-seven mother-child dyads (childage= 2-5 years, 85.2% black) living in poverty and without an individual child bed were randomly assigned (multimethod randomized waitlist control trial design) to bfk intervention-1 week postbaseline (initial intervention) or-2 weeks postbaseline (waitlist control), with follow-up at 1 month. bfk intervention (home bed delivery and written sleep health education) was provided to all families. children wore actigraphs and mothers completed daily diaries to assess child and maternal sleep, child behavior, and maternal mood for the initial 1-week comparison period. maternal-reported child sleep and behavior (internalizing and externalizing problems) were collected at 1 month after bfk participation for all families; 11 families completed a qualitative interview at 1-month follow-up. results: at 1 week after bfk, mothers' sleep duration increased by 1 hour compared to that of waitlist controls. no changes were found in child sleep, child behavior, or maternal mood. however, at 1 month after bfk intervention, improvements were found in mother-reported child night awakenings, sleep quality, sleep problems, and behavior. mothers qualitatively reported significant bfk benefits for child sleep and family well-being, although they noted challenges to transitioning young children to sleeping independently. conclusions: bed provision and sleep education for families living in poverty has an immediate impact on maternal sleep and reported well-being. child sleep and behavioral improvements are seen by 1 month, with children experiencing an initial adjustment period to sleeping independently. clinical trial registration: registry: clinicaltrials.gov; name: impact of beds for kids program on child sleep; url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ nct03392844; identifier: nct03392844.",AB_0603
