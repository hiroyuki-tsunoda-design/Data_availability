"in general, the prediction models are increasingly being used for reasoning and decision making in various applications. with the advancements in it based devices such as tablet-pc, touch-screen based smart phones, digital-pen/stylus based devices, and digitizers, the demand of real-time based applications is also increasing. the present study describes the language model (lm) based forecasting the occurrence of next possible gurmukhi character/word in a word/sentence, which depends on the immediately preceding character(s)/word(s), written in the real-time environment. the online handwritten captured character/word information is first segmented into its individual strokes, which are recognized using support vector machine (svm) classifier. once a character/word is recognized, this will be useful to assist the writers in order to provide the suggestions for next possible character/word. the n-gram language models (bigram and trigram) have been implemented at character- and word-level for this purpose. in this study, the corpus, punjabimonolingual text corpus-anglamt (available at https://tdil-dc.in), containing approximately 83,000 sentences has been used for training the model. experimental results show that the proposed online handwritten character/word forecasting framework significantly outperforms and produce consistent forecasts for the most likely character/word on the basis of given handwritten character/word information and saving computational costs. this model can also be used for many other non-indic and indic scripting languages.",AB_0518
"speech recognition (sr) is an emerging field in the native language nowadays. recognizing isolated words in the local language helps people use smartphones and electronic gadgets without technical or educational knowledge. this paper proposes a novel deep convolutional neural network (cnn) architecture to classify ten spoken bengali numerals. the proposed model generates almost similar prediction accuracy as compared to an end-to-end cnn with nine times fewer parameters has been trained. here, the raw audio samples are pre-processed, and then a unique hybrid feature of mel frequency cepstral coefficients (mfcc), spectral sub-band energy (sse), and log spectral sub-band energy (lsse) have been extracted frame-wise and engendered into a vector. finally, these vectors are fed to the proposed architecture of a one-dimensional cnn and achieve the highest test accuracy of 98.52%. the model has been trained for our created speech corpus of 14000 spoken bengali digits and 30000 spoken english digits from the audio-mnist dataset. the proposed neural model generates high prediction accuracy with a few times fewer parameters to be trained, generating low computational costs. the outcome of the proposed model is compared with several pre trained deep learning models; the result shows the model's superiority. source code: https:// github.com/bachchupaul/bengali-isolated-spoken-digit.",AB_0518
"with the advent of readily and widely available applications based on deepfake technology, several cybersecurity threats are on the rise. it is challenging to curtail these threats as deepfakes are realistic and very difficult to detect. the present work proposes a fake detection tool (fdt) that streamlines the procedure of fake detection by incorporating various manipulation techniques and aids users in detecting and visualizing the same. the tool is also integrated with twitter for streaming facial image posts based on hashtags. it provides an output dataframe and presents statistics of virality, sentiments, etc, using pie charts for better visualization. the proposed tool uses a wide variety of large-scale datasets for training to deal with the fakes in the wild and deploys models that are at par with the cutting-edge models. it is an efficient, user-friendly, and freely available software for fake detection. the source code of the fdt package toolkit is available at https://github.com/surbhiraj786/gui_fake-detection.(c) 2023 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0518
"the goal of detecting clusters of varying densities has gained a lot of attention among the researchers world wide. in this paper, we present a nearest neighbor variable density clustering (nnvdc) method, which is capable of detecting different densities, shapes, and sizes even in the presence of noise. it is a modified density-based clustering method based on the concept of k-nearest neighbors (knn) and requires only a single input parameter (value of k). the effectiveness of nnvdc method is first tested considering 21 artificial datasets (included self-generated and artificial benchmark datasets) and 5 real-world benchmark datasets from uci. nnvdc is compared with dbscan (ester et al., 1996), hdbscan (campello et al., 2013), snn (ertoz et al., 2003), dpc (rodriguez and laio, 2014), dpcsa (yu et al., 2019), snn-dpc (liu et al., 2018), rnn-dbscan (bryant and cios, 2018), and uifdbc (chowdhury et al., 2021) methods and found to give superior results w.r.t. three external and two internal cluster validity indices. to further establish the versatility of nnvdc, we test it over six real-world datasets: (i) one earthquake and (ii) five gene expression datasets. for earthquake dataset, the proposed nnvdc performs significantly well in comparison to dbscan, hdbscan, snn, uifdbc in terms of c-index and bh index. whereas for the gene expression datasets, the proposed method is found to be capable of identifying quality gene clusters w.r.t. c-index, bh index, and p-value. all source code of the proposed nnvdc method can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o_pesim7-k6b_frsesphegqbr76iqkfz?usp=sharing.",AB_0518
"background: tranexamic acid (ta) is used to control bleeding in patients with hemoptysis. however, the effectiveness of the different routes of ta administration has not been studied.research question: does the nebulized route of ta administration reduce the amount of hemoptysis compared with the iv route in patients presenting to the ed with hemoptysis?study design and methods: this was a pragmatic, open-label, randomized, parallel, single-center, pilot trial of nebulized ta (500 mg tid) vs iv ta (500 mg tid) in adult patients pre-senting to the ed with active hemoptysis. the primary outcome was cessation of bleeding at 30 min. secondary outcomes included amount of hemoptysis at 6, 12, and 24 h; interventional procedures; and side effects of ta. patients who were hemodynamically unstable or requiring immediate interventional procedure or mechanical ventilation were excluded from the study.results: of the 55 patients in each arm, hemoptysis cessation at 30 min following ta administration was significantly higher in the nebulization arm (n = 40) compared with the iv arm (n = 28): c2 (1, n = 110) = 5.55; p = .0019. also, hemoptysis amount was reduced significantly in the nebulization arm at all time periods of observation (p value at 30 min = .011, at 6 h = .002, 12 h = .0008, and at 24 h = .005). fewer patients in the nebulization arm required bronchial artery embolization (13 vs 21; p = .024) and thereby had higher discharge rates from the ed (67.92% vs 39.02%; p = .005). two patients in the nebulization arm had asymptomatic bronchoconstriction that resolved after short-acting beta-agonist nebulization. no patient discharged from the ed underwent any interventional procedure or revisited the ed with rebleed during the 72 h follow-up period. interpretation: nebulized ta may be more efficacious than iv ta in reducing the amount of hemoptysis and need for ed interventional procedures. future larger studies are needed to further explore the potential of nebulized ta compared with iv ta in patients with mild hemoptysis.clinical trial registration: clinical trials registry-india; no.: ctri/2019/05/019337;url: http://ctri.nic.in/clinicaltrials/advancesearchmain.php.chest 2023; 163(5):1176-1184",AB_0518
"an innovative adaptive neural network multisphere importance sampling (annm- is) is proposed and integrated with symbiotic organism search (sos) to form a framework for finding an engineering optimal design. building a single sphere in is to enhance the computational efficiency has been used for decades, annm-is provides a pioneering idea, in which multi-spheres are built. adaptive point, found by neural network (nn), is proposed to help for generating multiple spheres. annm- is is further integrated with sos to update nn for next iteration. as optimization iterations increase, adaptive nn provides more accurate reliability estimates. a two-step sos, considering exploration and exploitation, is designed to enhance the search performance. four reliability problem are first solved to confirm the correctness and effectiveness of annm-is, then another four structural optimization problem including a building controller design and a 25-bar truss design are solved. results shown that the proposed method drastically reduces the amount of function evaluation and computation time without sacrificing accuracy in reliability compared to those of other sampling methods. the developed framework can solve a complex structural optimization problem of accurate reliability with affordable price. the supporting source codes are available for download at https://github.com/johnthedy/rbdo- using-mis-nn-sos.",AB_0518
"introductionjob rotation is a work organisation strategy used to reduce work-related exposures and musculoskeletal complaints, yet evidence for the efficacy of the approach is weak. mismatch between job rotation and company needs, lack of full implementation, lack of exposure variation in included tasks and failure to assess variation may underlie inconclusive research findings to date. the study aims to develop a job rotation with company stakeholders, perform a process evaluation of the implementation, and determine the extent to which the intervention improves the physical and psychosocial work environment, indicators of health, gender and social equality among workers and production quality and resilience.methods and analysisapproximately 60 production workers at a swedish commercial laundromat will be recruited. physical and psychosocial work environment conditions, health, productivity and gender and social equality will be assessed pre and post intervention, using surveys, accelerometers, heart rate, electromyography and focus groups. a task-based exposure matrix will be constructed, and exposure variation estimated at the level of the individual worker pre and post intervention. an implementation process evaluation will be conducted. job rotation efficacy will be assessed in terms of improvement in work environment conditions, health, gender and social inequality, and production quality and resilience. this study will provide novel information on the effects of the job rotation on physical and psychosocial work environment conditions, production quality and rate, health and gender and social inequality among blue-collar workers in a highly multicultural workplace.ethics and disseminationthe study received approval from the swedish ethical review authority (reference number 2019-00228). the results of the project will be shared directly with the employees, managers and union representatives from the participating company, other relevant labour market stakeholders and with researchers at national and international conferences and via scientific publication.trial registration numberthe study is preregistered with the open science framework (https://osf.io/zmdc8/).",AB_0518
"background: rbc folate concentrations are monitored at the population level, with a recommended threshold for optimal neural tube defect (ntd) prevention. a corresponding threshold for serum folate has not been established.objectives: this study aimed to estimate the serum folate insufficiency threshold corresponding to the rbc folate threshold for ntd prevention and examine how this threshold is modified by vitamin b12 status.methods: participants were women (15-40 y; not pregnant or lactating; n = 977) from a population-based biomarker survey in southern india. rbc folate and serum folate were measured via microbiologic assay. rbc folate deficiency (<305 nmol/l) and insufficiency (<748 nmol/l), serum vitamin b12 deficiency (<148 pmol/l) and vitamin b12 insufficiency (<221 pmol/l), elevated plasma mma (>0.26 mu mol/l), elevated plasma homocysteine (>10.0 mu mol/l), and elevated hba1c (>= 6.5%) were evaluated. bayesian linear models were used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted thresholds.results: compared with adequate vitamin b12 status, the estimated serum folate threshold was higher in participants with serum vitamin b12 deficiency (72.5 vs. 28.1 nmol/l) or vitamin b12 insufficiency (48.7 vs. 24.3 nmol/l) and elevated mma (55.6 vs. 25.9 nmol/l). the threshold was lower in participants with elevated hba1c (hba1c >= 6.5% vs. <6.5%; 21.0 vs. 40.5 nmol/l).conclusions: the estimated serum folate threshold for optimal ntd prevention was similar to previous reports (24.3 vs. 25.6 nmol/l) among participants with sufficient vitamin b12 status. however, this threshold was more than 2-fold higher in participants with vitamin b12 deficiency and substantially higher across all indicators of insufficient vitamin b12 status (<221 pmol/l, elevated mma, combined b12, impaired vitamin b12 status), and lower in participants with elevated hba1c. findings suggest a serum folate threshold for ntd prevention may be possible in some settings; however, it may not be appropriate in populations with high prevalence of vitamin b12 insufficiency. am j clin nutr 2023;xx:xx-xx.this trial was registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov as nct04048330.",AB_0518
"glioma has emerged as the deadliest form of brain tumor for human beings. timely diagnosis of these tumors is a major step towards effective oncological treatment. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) typically offers a non-invasive inspection of brain lesions. however, manual inspection of tumors from mri scans requires a large amount of time and it is also an error-prone process. therefore, automated diagnosis of tumors plays a crucial role in clinical management and surgical interventions of gliomas. in this study, we propose a convolutional neural network (cnn)-based framework for non-invasive grading of tumors from 3d mri scans. the proposed framework incorporates two novel cnn architectures. the first cnn architecture performs the segmentation of tumors from multimodel mri volumes. the proposed segmentation network leverages the spatial and channel attention modules to recalibrate the feature maps across the layers. the second network utilizes the multi-task learning strategy to perform the classification based on the three glioma grading tasks which include characterization of tumor into low-grade or high-grade, identification of 1p19q, and isocitrate dehydrogenase (idh) status. we have carried out several experiments to evaluate the performance of our method. extensive experimental observations indicate that the proposed framework achieves better performance than several state-of-the-art methods. we have also executed welch's-$t$t test to show the statistical significance of grading results. the source code of this study is available at https://github.com/prasunc/gliomanet.",AB_0518
"tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-a) is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine that is crucial in controlling the signaling pathways within the immune cells. recent studies reported that higher expression levels of tnf-a are associated with the progression of several diseases, including cancers, cytokine release syndrome in covid-19, and autoimmune disorders. thus, it is the need of the hour to develop immunotherapies or subunit vaccines to manage tnf-a progression in various disease conditions. in the pilot study, we proposed a host-specific in-silico tool for predicting, designing, and scanning tnf-a inducing epitopes. the prediction models were trained and validated on the experimentally validated tnf-a inducing/non-inducing epitopes from human and mouse hosts. firstly, we developed alignment-free (machine learning based models using composition-based features of peptides) methods for predicting tnf-a inducing peptides and achieved maximum auroc of 0.79 and 0.74 for human and mouse hosts, respectively. secondly, an alignment-based (using blast) method has been used for predicting tnf-a inducing epitopes. finally, a hybrid method (combination of alignment-free and alignmentbased method) has been developed for predicting epitopes. hybrid approach achieved maximum auroc of 0.83 and 0.77 on an independent dataset for human and mouse hosts, respectively. we have also identified potential tnf-a inducing peptides in different proteins of hiv-1, hiv-2, sars-cov-2, and human insulin. the best models developed in this study has been incorporated in the webserver tnfepitope (https://webs.iiitd.edu. in/raghava/tnfepitope/), standalone package and gitlab (https://gitlab.com/raghavalab/tnfepitope).",AB_0518
