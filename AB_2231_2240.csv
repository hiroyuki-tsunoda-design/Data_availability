"backgroundobtaining accurate drug-target binding affinity (dta) information is significant for drug discovery and drug repositioning. although some methods have been proposed for predicting dta, the features of proteins and drugs still need to be further analyzed. recently, deep learning has been successfully used in many fields. hence, designing a more effective deep learning method for predicting dta remains attractive.resultsdynamic graph dta (dgdta), which uses a dynamic graph attention network combined with a bidirectional long short-term memory (bi-lstm) network to predict dta is proposed in this paper. dgdta adopts drug compound as input according to its corresponding simplified molecular input line entry system (smiles) and protein amino acid sequence. first, each drug is considered a graph of interactions between atoms and edges, and dynamic attention scores are used to consider which atoms and edges in the drug are most important for predicting dta. then, bi-lstm is used to better extract the contextual information features of protein amino acid sequences. finally, after combining the obtained drug and protein feature vectors, the dta is predicted by a fully connected layer. the source code is available from github at https://github.com/luojunwei/dgdta.conclusionsthe experimental results show that dgdta can predict dta more accurately than some other methods.",AB_0224
"multiplex pcr is an increasingly popular method for identifying species, investigating environmental diversity, and conducting phylogenetic analysis. the complexity and increasing availability of diverse templates necessitate a highly automated approach to design degenerate primer pairs for specific targets with multiple sequences. existing tools for degenerate primer design suffer from poor maintenance, semi-automation, low adaptability, and low tolerance for gaps. we developed pmprimer, a python-based tool for automated design and evaluation of multiplex pcr primer pairs for specific targets using diverse templates. pmprimer automatically designs optimal multiplex pcr primer pairs using a statistical-based template filter; performs multiple sequence alignment, conserved region identification, and primer design; and evaluates the primers based on template coverage, taxon specificity, and target specificity. pmprimer identifies conserved regions using shannon's entropy method, tolerates gaps using a haplotype-based method, and evaluates multiplex pcr primer pairs based on template coverage and taxon specificity. we tested pmprimer using datasets with diverse levels of conservation, sizes, and applications, including tuf genes of staphylococci, hsp65 genes of mycobacteriaceae, and 16s ribosomal rna genes of archaea. pmprimer showed outstanding performance compared with existing tools and experimental validated primers. pmprimer is available as a python package at https://github.com/agiscuipeng/pmprimer.",AB_0224
"traditional image detail enhancement is local filter-based or global filter-based. in both approaches, the original image is first divided into the base layer and the detail layer, and then the enhanced image is obtained by amplifying the detail layer. our method is different, and its innovation lies in the special way to get the image detail layer. the detail layer in our method is obtained by updating the residual features, and the updating mechanism is usually based on searching and matching similar patches. however, due to the diversity of image texture features, perfect matching is often not possible. in this paper, the process of searching and matching is treated as a thermodynamic process, where the metropolis theorem can minimize the internal energy and get the global optimal solution of this task, that is, to find a more suitable feature for a better detail enhancement performance. extensive experiments have proven that our algorithm can achieve better results in quantitative metrics testing and visual effects evaluation. the source code can be obtained from the website https://github.com/hehesjtu/metropolis-theorem.",AB_0224
"in this paper, we present an interactive advertising system based on augmented reality(ar) called arias, which is manipulated with gestures for displaying advertising videos. two-dimensional markers are defined in the system. the system captures the frame data through the camera in real time, uses opencv library to identify the predefined markers, and calculates the pose of markers captured by the camera. with opengl library, a virtual cubic model is created at the position of the marker, and thus videos or images are displayed on the six faces of the cube. the virtual cube, together with the original frame data collected by the camera, is displayed in the interactive window to achieve the augmented reality effect. customers are accessible to various advertising content by observing the marker from different positions. the system, meanwhile, supports gesture operation in order to make the customers pay attention to the content they are interested in with one hand. the mediapipe hand framework is used to extract the landmarks of hands, based on which, a series of gestures are designed for interactive operation. the efficiency and accuracy of the system are tested and analyzed with the result, indicating that the system has high reliability and good interactiveness. this system is open at https://github.com/wanzhuxie/arias/tree/plos-one.",AB_0224
"this study systematically investigated the causal relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) and major depression (md). single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) associated with disorders of interest were screened via the genome-wide association study (gwas) enrolling individuals of european descent. summary-level data for gerd and md were extracted from the uk biobank. the inverse-variance-weighted (ivw) method was utilized as the primary analysis. sensitivity analyses were performed using the mr-egger method, the maximum likelihood method, the mr-pleiotropy residual sum outlier (mr-presso) method, and mr-robust adjusted profile score (mr-raps) method. mr-egger regression, heterogeneity tests, pleiotropy tests, and leave-one-out tests were also performed to analyze sensitivity. the mr steiger test was used to verify the directionality of the exposure to the outcome. an available website tool (https://shiny.cnsgenomics.com/mrnd/) was used to calculate the statistical power of mr analysis. meta-analysis was applied to test md's average genetically predicted effect on gerd. our mr study showed a bidirectional causal association between md and gerd. regarding md to gerd, there was a positive association between them; the ors were 1.500 (95% ci = 1.320-1.704; p = 4.91e-10) and 2.058 (95% ci = 1.868-2.267; p = 2.20e-48) in the ivw method, respectively. in addition, the meta-analysis also showed a strong positive causal association between md and gerd. when exposure and outcome were reversed, genetic predisposition to gerd was significantly associated with the overall risk of advanced md (ieu-a-1187, or = 1.982, 95% ci = 1.694-2.319, p = 1.41e-17; ieu-b-102, or = 1.612, 95% ci = 1.530-2.700, p = 1.15e-70). our study provides 100% power to detect the causal effect of md on gerd and vice versa. genetically predicted md was positively associated with higher gerd risk, and vice versa. our study reminds clinicians to pay attention to screening for gerd when diagnosing and treating md and vice versa. moreover, there may be positive feedback between md and gerd when treating and preventing one disorder may benefit the treatment and prevention of the other.",AB_0224
"the identification of protein-protein interaction (ppi) sites is essential in the research of protein function and the discovery of new drugs. so far, a variety of computational tools based on machine learning have been developed to accelerate the identification of ppi sites. however, existing methods suffer from the low predictive accuracy or the limited scope of application. specifically, some methods learned only global or local sequential features, leading to low predictive accuracy, while others achieved improved performance by extracting residue interactions from structures but were limited in their application scope for the serious dependence on precise structure information. there is an urgent need to develop a method that integrates comprehensive information to realize proteome-wide accurate profiling of ppi sites. herein, a novel ensemble framework for ppi sites prediction, ensemppis, was therefore proposed based on transformer and gated convolutional networks. ensemppis can effectively capture not only global and local patterns but also residue interactions. specifically, ensemppis was unique in (a) extracting residue interactions from protein sequences with transformer and (b) further integrating global and local sequential features with the ensemble learning strategy. compared with various existing methods, ensemppis exhibited either superior performance or broader applicability on multiple ppi sites prediction tasks. moreover, pattern analysis based on the interpretability of ensemppis demonstrated that ensemppis was fully capable of learning residue interactions within the local structure of ppi sites using only sequence information. the web server of ensemppis is freely available at http://idrblab.org/ensemppis.",AB_0224
"traffic sign detection is a challenging task for unmanned driving systems. in the traffic sign detection process, the object size and weather conditions vary widely, which will have a certain impact on the detection accuracy. in order to solve the problem of balanced detecting precision of traffic sign recognition model in different weather conditions, and it is difficult to detect occluded objects and small objects, this paper proposes a small object detection algorithm based on improved yolov5s in complex weather. first, we add the coordinate attention(ca) mechanism in the backbone, a light-weight yet effective module, embedding the location information of traffic signs into the channel attention to improve the feature extraction ability of the network. second, we exploit effectively fine-grained features about small traffic signs from the shallower layers by adding one prediction head to yolov5s. finally, we use alpha-iou to improve the original positioning loss ciou, improving the accuracy of bbox regression. applying this model to the recently proposed cctsdb 2021 dataset, for small objects, the precision is 88.1%, and the recall rate is 79.8%, compared with the original yolov5s model, it is improved by 12.5% and 23.9% respectively, and small traffic signs can be effectively detected under different weather conditions, with low miss rate and high detection accuracy. the source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yang-0706/improvedyolov5s.",AB_0224
"shot is one of the fundamental unit in the content structure of a film, which can provide insights into the film-director's ideas. by analyzing the properties and types of shots, we can gain a better understanding of a film's visual language. in this paper, we delve deeply into the task of shot type classification, proposing that utilizing multimodal video inputs can effectively improve the accuracy of the task, and that shot type classification is closely related to low-level spatiotemporal semantic features. to this end, we propose a lightweight weak semantic relevance framework (lwsrnet) for classifying cinematographic shot types. our framework comprises two modules: a linear modalities fusion module (lmf module) capable of fusing an arbitrary number of video modalities, and a weak semantic 3d-cnn based feature extraction backbone (wsfe module) for classifying shot movement and scale, respectively. moreover, to support practical cinematographic analysis, we collect fullshots, a large film shot dataset containing 27k shots from 19 movies with professionally annotations for movement and scale information. following experimental results validate the correctness of our proposed hypotheses, while our framework also outperforms previous methods in terms of accuracy with fewer parameters and computations, on both fullshots and movieshots datasets. our code is available at (https://github.com/litchiar/shotclassification).",AB_0224

"membrane proteins are critical mediators for tumor progression and present enormous therapeutic potentials. although gene profiling can identify their cancer-specific signatures, systematic correlations between protein functions and tumor-related mechanisms are still unclear. we present here the crmp-sol database (https://bio-gateway.aigene.org.cn/g/crmp), which aims to breach the gap between the two. machine learning was used to extract key functional descriptions for protein visualization in the 3d-space, where spatial distributions provide function-based predictive connections between proteins and cancer types. crmp-sol also presents qty-enabled water-soluble designs to facilitate native membrane protein studies despite natural hydrophobicity. five examples with varying transmembrane helices in different categories were used to demonstrate the feasibility. native and redesigned proteins exhibited highly similar characteristics, predicted structures and binding pockets, and slightly different docking poses against known ligands, although task-specific designs are still required for proteins more susceptible to internal hydrogen bond formations. the database can accelerate therapeutic developments and biotechnological applications of cancer-related membrane proteins.",AB_0224
