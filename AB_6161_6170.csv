"somatic nucleotide mutations can contribute to cancer cell survival, proliferation, and pathogenesis. although research has focused on identifying which mutations are drivers versus pas-sengers, quantifying the proliferative effects of specific variants within clinically relevant contexts could reveal novel aspects of cancer biology. to enable researchers to estimate these cancer effects, we developed cancereffectsizer, an r package that organizes somatic variant data, facilitates mutational signature analysis, cal-culates site-specific mutation rates, and tests models of selection. built-in models support effect estimation from single nucleotides to genes. users can also estimate epistatic effects between paired sets of variants, or design and test custom models. the utility of cancer effect was validated by showing in a pan-cancer dataset that somatic variants classified as likely pathogenic or pathogenic in clinvar exhibit substantially higher effects than most other variants. indeed, cancer effect was a better predictor of pathogenic status than variant prevalence or functional impact scores. in addition, the application of this approach toward pairwise epistasis in lung adenocarcinoma showed that driver mutations in braf, egfr, or kras typically reduce selection for alterations in the other two genes. companion reference data packages support analyses using the hg19 or hg38 human genome builds, and a reference data builder enables use with any species or custom genome build with available genomic and transcriptomic data. a reference manual, tutorial, and public source code repository are available at https://townsend-lab-yale.github.io/ cancereffectsizer. comprehensive estimation of cancer effects of somatic mutations can provide insights into oncogenic trajectories, with implications for cancer prognosis and treatment.",AB_0617
"we present a systematic methodology, built within the open knowledgebase of interatomic models (openkim) framework (https://openkim.org), for quantifying properties of grain boundaries (gbs) for arbitrary interatomic potentials (ips), gb character, and lattice structure and species. the framework currently generates results for symmetric tilt gbs in cubic materials, but can be readily extended to other types of boundaries. in this paper, gb energy data are presented that were generated automatically for al, ni, cu, fe, and mo with 225 ips; the system is installed on openkim.org and will continue to generate results for all new ips uploaded to openkim. the results from the atomistic calculations are compared to the lattice matching model, which is a semi-analytic geometric model for approximating gb energy. it is determined that the energy predicted by all ips (that are stable for the given boundary type) correlate closely with the energy from the model, up to a multiplicative factor. it thus is concluded that the qualitative form of the gb energy versus tilt angle is dominated more by geometry than the choice of ip, but that the ip can strongly affect the energy level. the spread in gb energy predictions across the ensemble of ips in openkim provides a measure of uncertainty for gb energy predictions by classical ips.",AB_0617
"a major challenge for clustering algorithms is to balance the trade-off between homogeneity, i.e., the degree to which an individual cluster includes only related sequences, and completeness, the degree to which related sequences are broken up into multiple clusters. most algorithms are conservative in grouping sequences with other sequences. remote homologs may fail to be clustered together and instead form unnecessarily distinct clusters. the resulting clusters have high homogeneity but completeness that is too low. we propose complet+, a computationally scalable post-processing method to increase the completeness of clusters without an undue cost in homogeneity. complet+ proves to effectively merge closely-related clusters of protein that have verified structural relationships in the scope classification scheme, improving the completeness of clustering results at little cost to homogeneity. applying complet+ to clusters obtained using mmseqs2's clusterupdate achieves an increased v-measure of 0.09 and 0.05 at the scope superfamily and family levels, respectively. complet+ also creates more biologically representative clusters, as shown by a substantial increase in adjusted mutual information (ami) and adjusted rand index (ari) metrics when comparing predicted clusters to biological classifications. complet+ similarly improves clustering metrics when applied to other methods, such as cd-hit and linclust. finally, we show that complet+ runtime scales linearly with respect to the number of clusters being post-processed on a cog dataset of over 3 million sequences. code and supplementary information is available on github: https://github.com/eesi/complet-plus.",AB_0617
"alzheimer's disease (ad) is one of the most challenging neurodegenerative diseases because of its complicated and progressive mechanisms, and multiple risk factors. increasing research evidence demonstrates that genetics may be a key factor responsible for the occurrence of the disease. although previous reports identified quite a few ad-associated genes, they were mostly limited owing to patient sample size and selection bias. there is a lack of comprehensive research aimed to identify ad-associated risk mutations systematically. to address this challenge, we hereby construct a large-scale ad mutation and co-mutation framework (adsyn-net'), and propose deep learning models named deep-smci and deep-cmci configured with fully connected layers that are capable of predicting cognitive impairment of subjects effectively based on genetic mutation and co-mutation profiles. next, we apply the customized frameworks to data sets to evaluate the importance scores of the mutations and identified mutation effectors and co mutation combination vulnerabilities contributing to cognitive impairment. furthermore, we evaluate the influence of mutation pairs on the network architecture to dissect the genetic organization of ad and identify novel co-mutations that could be responsible for dementia, laying a solid foundation for proposing future targeted therapy for ad precision medicine. our deep learning model codes are available open access here: https://github.com/pan-bio/ad-mutation-effectors.",AB_0617
"the amount of data produced by genome sequencing experiments has been growing rapidly over the past several years, making compression important for efficient storage, transfer and analysis of the data. in recent years, nanopore sequencing technologies have seen increasing adoption since they are portable, real-time and provide long reads. however, there has been limited progress on compression of nanopore sequencing reads obtained in fastq files since most existing tools are either general-purpose or specialized for short read data. we present nanospring, a reference-free compressor for nanopore sequencing reads, relying on an approximate assembly approach. we evaluate nanospring on a variety of datasets including bacterial, metagenomic, plant, animal, and human whole genome data. for recently basecalled high quality nanopore datasets, nanospring, which focuses only on the base sequences in the fastq file, uses just 0.35-0.65 bits per base which is 3-6x lower than general purpose compressors like gzip. nanospring is competitive in compression ratio and compression resource usage with the state-of-the-art tool colord while being significantly faster at decompression when using multiple threads (> 4xfaster decompression with 20 threads). nanospring is available on github at https://github.com/qm2/nanospring.",AB_0617

"motivation: small insertion and deletion (sindel) of human genome has an important implication for human disease. one important mechanism for non-coding sindel (nc-sindel) to have an impact on human diseases and phenotypes is through the regulation of gene expression. nevertheless, current sequencing experiments may lack statistical power and resolution to pinpoint the functional sindel due to lower minor allele frequency or small effect size. as an alternative strategy, a supervised machine learning method can identify the otherwise masked functional sindels by predicting their regulatory potential directly. however, computational methods for annotating and predicting the regulatory sindels, especially in the non-coding regions, are underdeveloped. results: by leveraging labeled nc-sindels identified by cis-expression quantitative trait loci analyses across 44 tissues in genotype-tissue expression (gtex), and a compilation of both generic functional annotations and large-scale epigenomic profiles, we develop tissue-specific variant annotation for non-coding indel (tivan-indel), which is a supervised computational framework for predicting non-coding regulatory sindels. as a result, we demonstrate that tivan-indel achieves the best prediction performance in both with-tissue prediction and cross-tissue prediction. as an independent evaluation, we train tivan-indel from the 'whole blood' tissue in gtex and test the model using 15 immune cell types from an independent study named database of immune cell expression. lastly, we perform an enrichment analysis for both true and predicted sindels in key regulatory regions such as chromatin interactions, open chromatin regions and histone modification sites, and find biologically meaningful enrichment patterns. availability and implementation: https://github.com/lichen-lab/tivan-indel contact: li.chen1@ufl.edu supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0617
"motivation: the human genome encodes over 500 distinct protein kinases which regulate nearly all cellular processes by the specific phosphorylation of protein substrates. while advances in mass spectrometry and proteomics studies have identified thousands of phosphorylation sites across species, information on the specific kinases that phosphorylate these sites is currently lacking for the vast majority of phosphosites. recently, there has been a major focus on the development of computational models for predicting kinase-substrate associations. however, most current models only allow predictions on a subset of well-studied kinases. furthermore, the utilization of hand-curated features and imbalances in training and testing datasets pose unique challenges in the development of accurate predictive models for kinase-specific phosphorylation prediction. motivated by the recent development of universal protein language models which automatically generate context-aware features from primary sequence information, we sought to develop a unified framework for kinase-specific phosphosite prediction, allowing for greater investigative utility and enabling substrate predictions at the whole kinome level. results: we present a deep learning model for kinase-specific phosphosite prediction, termed phosformer, which predicts the probability of phosphorylation given an arbitrary pair of unaligned kinase and substrate peptide sequences. we demonstrate that phosformer implicitly learns evolutionary and functional features during training, removing the need for feature curation and engineering. further analyses reveal that phosformer also learns substrate specificity motifs and is able to distinguish between functionally distinct kinase families. benchmarks indicate that phosformer exhibits significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art models, while also presenting a more generalized, unified, and interpretable predictive framework. availability and implementation: code and data are available at https://github.com/esbgkannan/phosformer. contact: nkannan@uga.edu or shengli@virginia.edu supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0617
"the regulation of genes by cis-regulatory elements (cres) is complex and differs between cell types. visual analysis of large collections of chromatin profiles across diverse cell types, integrated with computational methods, can reveal meaningful biological insights. we developed cistrome explorer, a web-based interactive visual analytics tool for exploring thousands of chromatin profiles in diverse cell types. integrated with the cistrome data browser database which contains thousands of chip-seq, dnase-seq and atac-seq samples, cistrome explorer enables the discovery of patterns of cres across cell types and the identification of transcription factor binding underlying these patterns. availability and implementation: cistrome explorer and its source code are available at http://cisvis.gehlenborglab. org/ and released under the mit license. documentation can be accessed via http://cisvis.gehlenborglab.org/docs/. contact: nils@hms.harvard.edu or cliff_meyer@ds.dfci.harvard.edu supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0617
"we recently introduced the gut microbiome wellness index (gmwi), a stool metagenome-based indicator for assessing health by determining the likelihood of disease given the state of one's gut microbiome. the calculation of our wellness index depends on the relative abundances of health-prevalent and health-scarce species. encouragingly, gmwi has already been utilized in various studies focusing on differences in the gut microbiome between cases and controls. herein, we introduce the gmwi-webtool, a user-friendly browser application that computes gmwi, health-prevalent/-scarce species' relative abundances, and alpha-diversities from stool shotgun metagenome taxonomic profiles. users of our interactive online tool can visualize their results and compare them side-by-side with those from our pooled reference dataset of metagenomes, as well as export data in.csv format and high-resolution figures. availability and implementation: gmwi-webtool is freely available here: https://gmwi-webtool.github.io/.",AB_0617
