"background: antiretroviral therapy (art) is considered the most important intervention for hiv-positive patients; thus, encouraging the use of and adherence to art are vital to hiv treatment outcomes. advances in web and mobile technologies hold potential in supporting hiv treatment management.objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a theory-based mobile health (mhealth) intervention on health behaviors and hiv treatment adherence among patients with hiv/aids in vietnam.methods: we performed a randomized controlled trial on 425 hiv patients in two of the largest hiv clinics in hanoi, vietnam. both the intervention group (238 patients) and the control group (187 patients) received regular consultations with doctors and then participated in 1-month and 3-month follow-up visits. patients in the intervention group received a theory-driven smartphone app to facilitate medication adherence and self-efficacy in hiv patients. measurements were developed based on the health belief model, which included the visual analog scale of art adherence, hiv treatment adherence self-efficacy scale, and hiv symptom management self-efficacy scale. we also included the 9-item patient health questionnaire (phq-9) to assess patients' mental health throughout treatment.results: in the intervention group, the adherence score increased significantly (beta=1.07, 95% ci .24-1.90) after 1 month, whereas the hiv adherence self-efficacy was significantly higher after 3 months (beta=2.17, 95% ci 2.07-2.27) compared to the control group. there was a positive but low level of change in risk behaviors such as drinking, smoking, and drug use. factors related to positive change in adherence were being employed and having stable mental well-being (lower phq-9 scores). factors associated with self-efficacy in treatment adherence and symptom management were gender, occupation, younger age, and having no other underlying conditions. a longer duration of art increased treatment adherence but decreased self-efficacy in symptom management.conclusions: our study demonstrated that the mhealth app could improve the overall art adherence self-efficacy of patients. further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to support our findings.trial registration: thai clinical trials registry tctr20220928003; https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/show/tctr20220928003",AB_0467
"highpt is a mathematica package for the analysis of high-energy data of semileptonic transitions at hadron colliders. it allows to compute high-pt tail observables for semileptonic processes, i.e. drell-yan cross sections, for dilepton and monolepton final states at the lhc. these observables can be calculated at tree level within the standard model effective field theory, including the relevant operators up to dimension eight to ensure a consistent description of the cross section including terms of o(a-4) in the cutoff scale a. for new physics models with new mediators that can be resolved at lhc energies, highpt can also account for the full propagation effects of these new bosonic states at tree level. using the available data from the high-pt tails in the relevant lhc run-ii searches by the atlas and cms collaborations, highpt can also construct the corresponding likelihoods for all possible flavors of the leptonic final states. as an illustration, we derive and compare constraints on wilson coefficients at different orders in the effective field theory expansion, and we investigate lepton flavor violation for the s3 leptoquark model. the highpt code is publicly available at 0.program summary program title: highpt cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /zh5yx6j4xj .1 developer's repository link: https://github .com /highpt /highpt licensing provisions: mit license programming language: mathematica nature of problem: constraining new physics scenarios with high-pt drell-yan data. solution method: we present the first tool allowing to extract bounds, computed at leading order, on semileptonic transitions in the standard model effective field theory, including operators up to dimension eight, and in explicit new physics models.(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ( .org /licenses /by /4 .0/).",AB_0467
"we developed an open-source chemical reaction equilibrium solver in python (caspy, https://github.com/ omoultosethtudelft/caspy) to compute the concentration of species in any reactive liquid-phase absorption system. we derived an expression for a mole fraction-based equilibrium constant as a function of excess chemical potential, standard ideal gas chemical potential, temperature, and volume. as a case study, we computed the co2 absorption isotherm and speciation in a 23 wt % n- methyldiethanolamine (mdea)/water solution at 313.15 k, and compared the results with available data from the literature. the results show that the computed co2 isotherms and speciations are in excellent agreement with experimental data, demonstrating the accuracy and the precision of our solver. the binary absorptions of co2 and h2s in 50 wt % mdea/water solutions at 323.15 k were computed and compared with available data from the literature. the computed co2 isotherms showed good agreement with other modeling studies from the literature while the computed h2s isotherms did not agree well with experimental data. the experimental equilibrium constants used as an input were not adjusted for h2s/co2/mdea/water systems and need to be adjusted for this system. using free energy calculations with two different force fields (gaff and opls-aa) and quantum chemistry calculations, we computed the equilibrium constant (k) of the protonated mdea dissociation reaction. despite the good agreement of the opls-aa force field (ln[k] = -24.91) with the experiments (ln[k] = -23.04), the computed co2 pressures were significantly underestimated. we systematically investigated the limitations of computing co2 absorption isotherms using free energy and quantum chemistry calculations and showed that the computed values of mu iex are very sensitive to the point charges used in the simulations, which limits the predictive power of this method.",AB_0467
"background decisions on stroke prevention strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation (af) depend on the perceived risks of stroke and bleeding with different antithrombotic treatment strategies. the study objectives were to evaluate net clinical outcome with oral anticoagulation (oac) for the individual patient with af and to identify clinically relevant thresholds for oac treatment.methods patients with af receiving oac treatment in the randomized aristotle and re-ly trials, with available biomarkers for calculation of abc-af scores at baseline, were included (n = 23,121). observed 1-year risk on oac was compared with predicted 1-year risk if the same patients would not have received oac using the abc-af scores calibrated for aspirin. net clinical outcome was defined as the sum of stroke and major bleeding risks.results the ratio between the 1-year incidence of major bleeding and stroke/systemic embolism events ranged from 1.4 to 10.6 according to different abc-af risk profiles. net clinical outcome analyses showed that in patients with an abc-af-stroke risk > 1a/a per year on oac ( >3a/a without oac), treatment with oac consistently provides larger net clinical benefit than no-oac treatment. in patients with an abc-af-stroke risk <1.0a/a per year on oac ( <3a/a without oac) an individualized balancing of risks regarding oac or no-oac treatment is needed.conclusions in patients with af, the abc-af risk scores allow an individual and continuous estimate of the balance between benefits and risks with oac treatment. this precision medicine tool therefore seems useful as decision support and visualizes the net clinical benefit or harm with oac treatment ( http://www.abc-score.com/abcaf/ ).clinical trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct00412984 (aristotle) and nct00262600 (re-ly).(am heart j 2023;261:55-63.)",AB_0467

"a substantial fraction of metabolic features remains undetermined in mass spectrometry (ms)-based metabolomics, and molecular formula annotation is the starting point for unraveling their chemical identities. here we present bottom-up tandem ms (ms/ms) interrogation, a method for de novo formula annotation. our approach prioritizes ms/ms-explainable formula candidates, implements machine-learned ranking and offers false discovery rate estimation. compared with the mathematically exhaustive formula enumeration, our approach shrinks the formula candidate space by 42.8% on average. method benchmarking on annotation accuracy was systematically carried out on reference ms/ms libraries and real metabolomics datasets. applied on 155,321 recurrent unidentified spectra, our approach confidently annotated >5,000 novel molecular formulae absent from chemical databases. beyond the level of individual metabolic features, we combined bottom-up ms/ms interrogation with global optimization to refine formula annotations while revealing peak interrelationships. this approach allowed the systematic annotation of 37 fatty acid amide molecules in human fecal data. all bioinformatics pipelines are available in a standalone software, buddy (https://github.com/huanlab/buddy).",AB_0467
"in this paper, we present the updated sage-cci-omps+ climate data record of monthly zonal mean ozone profiles. this dataset covers the stratosphere and combines measurements by nine limb and occultation satellite instruments - sage ii (stratospheric aerosol and gases experiment ii), osiris (optical spectrograph and infrared imaging system), mipas (michelson interferometer for passive atmospheric sounding), sciamachy (scanning imaging spectrometer for atmospheric chartography), gomos (global ozone monitoring by occultation of stars), ace-fts (atmospheric chemistry experiment fourier transform spectrometer), omps-lp (ozone monitor profiling suite limb profiler), poam (polar ozone and aerosol measurement) iii, and sage iii/iss (stratospheric aerosol and gases experiment iii on the international space station). compared to the original version of the sage-cci-omps dataset (sofieva et al., 2017b), the update includes new versions of mipas, ace-fts, and osiris datasets and introduces data from additional sensors (poam iii and sage iii/iss) and retrieval processors (omps-lp). in this paper, we show detailed intercomparisons of ozone profiles from different instruments and data versions, with a focus on the detection of possible drifts in the datasets. the sage-cci-omps+ dataset has a better coverage of polar regions and of the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere (utls) than the previous dataset. we also studied the influence of including new datasets on ozone trends, which are estimated using multiple linear regression. the changes in the merged dataset do not change the overall morphology of post-1997 ozone trends; statistically significant trends are observed in the upper stratosphere. the largest changes in ozone trends are observed in polar regions, especially in the southern hemisphere. the updated sage-cci-omps+ dataset contains profiles of deseasonalized anomalies and ozone concentrations from 1984 to 2021, in 10 degrees latitude bins from 90 degrees s to 90 degrees n and in the altitude range from 10 to 50 km. the dataset is open access and available at https://climate.esa.int/en/projects/ozone/data/ (last access: 9 march 2023) and at ftp://cci_web@ftp-ae.oma.be/esacci (esa climate office; last access: 9 march 2023).",AB_0467
"widely used software systems such as video encoders are by necessity highly configurable, with hundreds or even thousands of options to choose from. their users often have a hard time finding suitable values for these options (i.e., finding a proper configuration of the software system) to meet their goals for the tasks at hand, e.g., compress a video down to a certain size. one dimension of the problem is of course that performance depends on the input data: e.g., a video as input to an encoder like x264 or a file fed to a tool like xz. to achieve good performance, users should therefore take into account both dimensions of (1) software variability and (2) input data. this paper details a large study over 8 configurable systems that quantifies the existing interactions between input data and configurations of software systems. the results exhibit that (1) inputs fed to software systems can interact with their configuration options in non-monotonous ways, significantly impacting their performance properties (2) input sensitivity can challenge our knowledge of software variability and question the relevance of performance predictive models for a field deployment. given the results of our study, we call researchers to address the problem of input sensitivity when tuning, predicting, understanding, and benchmarking configurable systems.please refer to https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0164121221002168 as an exam-ple of where to place this statement. editor s note: open science material was validated by the journal of systems and software open science board.(c) 2023 published by elsevier inc.",AB_0467
"reinforcement learning (rl) has emerged as one of the most promising and powerful techniques in deep learning. the training of intelligent agents requires a myriad of training examples which imposes a substantial computational cost. consequently, rl is seldom applied to real-world problems and historically has been limited to computer vision tasks, similar to supervised learning. this work proposes an rl framework for complex, partially observable, large-scale environments. we introduce novel techniques for tractable training on commodity gpus, and significantly reduce computational costs. furthermore, we present a self-supervised loss that improves the learning stability in applications with a long-time horizon, shortening the training time. we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution on the application of road extraction from high-resolution satellite images. we present experiments on satellite images of fifteen cities that demonstrate comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time rl has been applied for extracting road networks. the code is publicly available at https://github.com/nsarang/road-extraction-rl.",AB_0467
"although many workers speak with a non-native english accent, our understanding of this phenomenon is limited because prior work predominantly focused on men. this overlooks whether the biases women experience due to their accent man-ifests differently. to address this omission, we use an intersectional lens to examine how non-native accents associated with more gender-traditional countries may affect women's hiring outcomes. we argue that the bias women with these accents face is subtle due to an association of non-native (vs. native) accents with perceptions of women's warmth (whereas there are no such effects for men) and consequently higher perceptions of hireability. yet we posit that the indirect effect on hireability occurs within feminine, but not masculine, industries, which ultimately undermines equity by pushing women with these non-native accents into lower pay and prestige occupations. we found support for our hypotheses in three vignette-based experiments conducted in canada using a mandarin accent. managers and decision-makers need to be aware of the insidious bias women with these non-native accents experience because it may not be immediately apparent that an association of accent with higher ratings of warmth may undermine women at work. additional online materials for this article are available on pwq's website at https://ournals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/03616843231165475",AB_0467
