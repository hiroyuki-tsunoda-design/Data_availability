"motivation many important problems in bioinformatics (e.g. assembly or multiassembly) admit multiple solutions, while the final objective is to report only one. a common approach to deal with this uncertainty is finding safe partial solutions (e.g. contigs) which are common to all solutions. previous research on safety has focused on polynomially time solvable problems, whereas many successful and natural models are np-hard to solve, leaving a lack of safety tools for such problems. we propose the first method for computing all safe solutions for an np-hard problem, minimum flow decomposition (mfd). we obtain our results by developing a safety test for paths based on a general integer linear programming (ilp) formulation. moreover, we provide implementations with practical optimizations aimed to reduce the total ilp time, the most efficient of these being based on a recursive group-testing procedure.results experimental results on transcriptome datasets show that all safe paths for mfds correctly recover up to 90% of the full rna transcripts, which is at least 25% more than previously known safe paths. moreover, despite the np-hardness of the problem, we can report all safe paths for 99.8% of the over 27 000 non-trivial graphs of this dataset in only 1.5 h. our results suggest that, on perfect data, there is less ambiguity than thought in the notoriously hard rna assembly problem.availability and implementation https://github.com/algbio/mfd-safety.",AB_0529
"few-shot object detection has been extensively investigated by incorporating meta-learning into region-based detection frameworks. despite its success, the said paradigm is still constrained by several factors, such as (i) low-quality region proposals for novel classes and (ii) negligence of the inter-class correlation among different classes. such limitations hinder the generalization of base-class knowledge for the detection of novel-class objects. in this work, we design meta-detr, which (i) is the first image-level few-shot detector, and (ii) introduces a novel inter-class correlational meta-learning strategy to capture and leverage the correlation among different classes for robust and accurate few-shot object detection. meta-detr works entirely at image level without any region proposals, which circumvents the constraint of inaccurate proposals in prevalent few-shot detection frameworks. in addition, the introduced correlational meta-learning enables meta-detr to simultaneously attend to multiple support classes within a single feedforward, which allows to capture the inter-class correlation among different classes, thus significantly reducing the misclassification over similar classes and enhancing knowledge generalization to novel classes. experiments over multiple few-shot object detection benchmarks show that the proposed meta-detr outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. the implementation codes are publicly available at https://github.com/zhanggongjie/meta-detr.",AB_0529
"the protein ensemble database (ped) (url: https://proteinensemble.org) is the primary resource for depositing structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins. this updated version of ped reflects advancements in the field, denoting a continual expansion with a total of 461 entries and 538 ensembles, including those generated without explicit experimental data through novel machine learning (ml) techniques. with this significant increment in the number of ensembles, a few yet-unprecedented new entries entered the database, including those also determined or refined by electron paramagnetic resonance or circular dichroism data. in addition, ped was enriched with several new features, including a novel deposition service, improved user interface, new database cross-referencing options and integration with the 3d-beacons network-all representing efforts to improve the fairness of the database. foreseeably, ped will keep growing in size and expanding with new types of ensembles generated by accurate and fast ml-based generative models and coarse-grained simulations. therefore, among future efforts, priority will be given to further develop the database to be compatible with ensembles modeled at a coarse-grained level. graphical abstract",AB_0529
"backgroundpan-genome graphs are gaining importance in the field of bioinformatics as data structures to represent and jointly analyze multiple genomes. compacted de bruijn graphs are inherently suited for this purpose, as their graph topology naturally reveals similarity and divergence within the pan-genome. most state-of-the-art pan-genome graphs are represented explicitly in terms of nodes and edges. recently, an alternative, implicit graph representation was proposed that builds directly upon the unidirectional fm-index. as such, a memory-efficient graph data structure is obtained that inherits the fm-index' backward search functionality. however, this representation suffers from a number of shortcomings in terms of functionality and algorithmic performance.resultswe present a data structure for a pan-genome, compacted de bruijn graph that aims to address these shortcomings. it is built on the bidirectional fm-index, extending the ability of its unidirectional counterpart to navigate and search the graph in both directions. all basic graph navigation steps can be performed in constant time. based on these features, we implement subgraph visualization as well as lossless approximate pattern matching to the graph using search schemes. we demonstrate that we can retrieve all occurrences corresponding to a read within a certain edit distance in a very efficient manner. through a case study, we show the potential of exploiting the information embedded in the graph's topology through visualization and sequence alignment.conclusionswe propose a memory-efficient representation of the pan-genome graph that supports subgraph visualization and lossless approximate pattern matching of reads against the graph using search schemes. the c++ source code of our software, called nexus, is available at https://github.com/biointec/nexus under agpl-3.0 license.",AB_0529
"motivation gene co-expression measurements are widely used in computational biology to identify coordinated expression patterns across a group of samples. coordinated expression of genes may indicate that they are controlled by the same transcriptional regulatory program, or involved in common biological processes. gene co-expression is generally estimated from rna-sequencing data, which are commonly normalized to remove technical variability. here, we demonstrate that certain normalization methods, in particular quantile-based methods, can introduce false-positive associations between genes. these false-positive associations can consequently hamper downstream co-expression network analysis. quantile-based normalization can, however, be extremely powerful. in particular, when preprocessing large-scale heterogeneous data, quantile-based normalization methods such as smooth quantile normalization can be applied to remove technical variability while maintaining global differences in expression for samples with different biological attributes.results we developed snail (smooth-quantile normalization adaptation for the inference of co-expression links), a normalization method based on smooth quantile normalization specifically designed for modeling of co-expression measurements. we show that snail avoids formation of false-positive associations in co-expression as well as in downstream network analyses. using snail, one can avoid arbitrary gene filtering and retain associations to genes that only express in small subgroups of samples. this highlights the method's potential future impact on network modeling and other association-based approaches in large-scale heterogeneous data.availability and implementation the implementation of the snail algorithm and code to reproduce the analyses described in this work can be found in the github repository https://github.com/kuijjerlab/pysnail.",AB_0529
"motivation plasmids are carriers for antimicrobial resistance (amr) genes and can exchange genetic material with other structures, contributing to the spread of amr. there is no reliable approach to identify the transfer of amr genes across plasmids. this is mainly due to the absence of a method to assess the phylogenetic distance of plasmids, as they show large dna sequence variability. identifying and quantifying such transfer can provide novel insight into the role of small mobile elements and resistant plasmid regions in the spread of amr.results we developed ship, a novel method to quantify plasmid similarity based on the dynamics of plasmid evolution. this allowed us to find conserved fragments containing amr genes in structurally different and phylogenetically distant plasmids, which is evidence for lateral transfer. our results show that regions carrying amr genes are highly mobilizable between plasmids through transposons, integrons, and recombination events, and contribute to the spread of amr. identified transferred fragments include a multi-resistant complex class 1 integron in escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and a region encoding tetracycline resistance transferred through recombination in enterococcus faecalis.availability and implementation the code developed in this work is available at https://github.com/abeellab/plasmidhgt.",AB_0529
"a subcommittee of the netherlands commission on radiation dosimetry (ncs) was initiated in 2018 with the task to update and extend a previous publication (ncs-15) on the quality assurance of treatment planning systems (tps) (bruinvis et al 2005). the field of treatment planning has changed considerably since 2005. whereas the focus of the previous report was more on the technical aspects of the tps, the scope of this report is broader with a focus on a department wide implementation of the tps. new sections about education, automated planning, information technology (it) and updates are therefore added. although the scope is photon therapy, large parts of this report will also apply to all other treatment modalities. this paper is a condensed version of these guidelines; the full version of the report in english is freely available from the ncs website (http://radiationdosimetry.org/ncs/publications). the paper starts with the scope of this report in relation to earlier reports on this subject. next, general aspects of the commissioning process are addressed, like e.g. project management, education, and safety. it then focusses more on technical aspects such as beam commissioning and patient modeling, dose representation, dose calculation and (automated) plan optimisation. the final chapters deal with it-related subjects and scripting, and the process of updating or upgrading the tps.",AB_0529
"three-dimensional protein structures are invaluable sources of information for the functional annotation of protein molecules. describing the function of a protein sequence is one of the most common problems in biology. generally, this problem can be facilitated by studying the tertiary structure of proteins. in the lack of protein structures, comparative modeling often provides a useful three-dimensional model of the protein associated with at least one known protein structure. comparative modeling predicts the tertiary structure of a certain protein sequence (target) mainly based on its homological sequence to the sequence of one or more proteins with known structures (templates). modeller is one of the most widely used tools for homology or comparative modeling of three-dimensional protein structures. however, most users find it challenging to start with modeller as it is a command line based and requires knowledge of basic python scripting to use it efficiently. in this study, a web-based interface has been designed to predict the tertiary structure of proteins based on modeller, which does the comparative modeling automatically, and uses php and python programming languages. this tool is called easymodel and is available at http://bioinf.modares.ac.ir/software/easymodel/. easymodel provides a straightforward graphical interface for modeller that can be used in only one browser.",AB_0529
"motivation: investigating the 3d structure of chromatin provides new insights into transcriptional regulation. with the evolution of 3c next-generation sequencing methods like chia-pet and hi-c, the surge in data volume has highlighted the need for more efficient chromatin spatial modelling algorithms. this study introduces the cudammc method, based on the simulated annealing monte carlo approach and enhanced by gpu-accelerated computing, to efficiently generate ensembles of chromatin 3d structures. results: the cudammc calculations demonstrate significantly faster performance with better stability compared to our previous method on the same workstation. cudammc also substantially reduces the computation time required for generating ensembles of large chromatin models, making it an invaluable tool for studying chromatin spatial conformation. availability and implementation: open-source software and manual and sample data are freely available on https://github.com/sfglab/ cudammc.",AB_0529
"motivation: with the wide availability of single-cell rna-seq (scrna-seq) technology, population-scale scrna-seq datasets across multiple individuals and time points are emerging. while the initial investigations of these datasets tend to focus on standard analysis of clustering and differential expression, leveraging the power of scrna-seq data at the personalized dynamic gene co-expression network level has the potential to unlock subject and/or time-specific network-level variation, which is critical for understanding phenotypic differences. community detection from co-expression networks of multiple time points or conditions has been well-studied; however, none of the existing settings included networks from multiple subjects and multiple time points simultaneously. to address this, we develop multi-subject dynamic community detection (mudcod) for multi-subject community detection in personalized dynamic gene networks from scrna-seq. mudcod builds on the spectral clustering framework and promotes information sharing among the networks of the subjects as well as networks at different time points. it clusters genes in the personalized dynamic gene networks and reveals gene communities that are variable or shared not only across time but also among subjects. results: evaluation and benchmarking of mudcod against existing approaches reveal that mudcod effectively leverages apparent shared signals among networks of the subjects at individual time points, and performs robustly when there is no or little information sharing among the networks. applications to population-scale scrna-seq datasets of human-induced pluripotent stem cells during dopaminergic neuron differentiation and cd4thorn t cell activation indicate that mudcod enables robust inference for identifying time-varying personalized gene modules. our results illustrate how personalized dynamic community detection can aid in the exploration of subject-specific biological processes that vary across time. availability and implementation: mudcod is publicly available at https://github.com/bo1929/mudcod as a python package. implementation includes simulation and real-data experiments together with extensive documentation.",AB_0529
