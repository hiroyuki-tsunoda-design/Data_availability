"objective facial nerve function, hearing preservation, and tumor control have been the primary benchmarks used to assess vestibular schwannoma (vs) outcomes. acknowledging the frequent discrepancy between what physicians prioritize and what patients value, there has been increasing prioritization of patient-reported outcome measures when evaluating the impact of vs diagnosis and its treatment. motivated by reported limitations of prior instruments used to assess quality of life (qol) in patients with vs, the authors describe the development and validation of a new disease -specific qol measure: the vestibular schwannoma quality of life (vsqol) index. methods the content development phase comprised identification of clinically important domains and prioritization of feelings or concerns individuals with vs may have. the validation phase encompassed determining how items were grouped into domains and eliminating redundant items. both phases leveraged data from cross-sectional and longitudi-nal surveys, expertise from a multidisciplinary working group, and patients with a broad range of experiences with vs (n = 42 during content development and n = 263 during validation). domain scores from the new instrument were assessed for reliability and correlation with other measures of similar constructs. results the vsqol index consists of 40 items that evaluate the impact of vs diagnosis and its management on qol, treatment satisfaction, and employment and is estimated to take 8-10 minutes to complete. domain scores range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) and demonstrate excellent psychometric properties, including content, construct, and con-vergent validity and both internal consistency (cronbach's alphas 0.83 to 0.91) and test-retest reliability (reliability coef-ficients 0.86 to 0.96). conclusions the vsqol index is a valid and reliable measure that overcomes several limitations of prior instru-ments, including omission or underrepresentation of domains that frequently impact well-being, such as pain, cognition, satisfaction or regret surrounding treatment decisions, and occupational limitations, to comprehensively evaluate the impact of vs diagnosis or its treatment on qol. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.7.jns221104",AB_0410
"chest computed tomography (ct) has played a valuable, distinct role in the screening, diagnosis, and follow-up of covid-19 patients. the quantification of covid-19 pneumonia on ct has proven to be an important predictor of the treatment course and outcome of the patient although it remains heavily reliant on the radiologist's subjective perceptions. here, we show that with the adoption of ct for covid-19 management, a new type of psychophysical bias has emerged in radiology. a preliminary survey of 40 radiologists and a retrospective analysis of ct data from 109 patients from two hospitals revealed that radiologists overestimated the percentage of lung involvement by 10.23 +/- 4.65% and 15.8 +/- 6.6%, respectively. in the subsequent randomised controlled trial, artificial intelligence (ai) decision support reduced the absolute overestimation error ( p < 0.001) from 9.5% +/- 6.6 (no-ai analysis arm, n = 38) to 1.0% +/- 5.2 (ai analysis arm, n = 38). these results indicate a human perception bias in radiology that has clinically meaningful effects on the quantitative analysis of covid-19 on ct. the objectivity of ai was shown to be a valuable complement in mitigating the radiologist's subjectivity, reducing the overestimation tenfold. trial registration: https://clinicaltrial.gov. identifier: nct05282056, date of registration: 01/02/2022.",AB_0410
"this study presents a novel physics-based metaheuristic algorithm called kepler optimization al-gorithm (koa), inspired by kepler's laws of planetary motion to predict the position and velocity of planets at any given time. in koa, each planet with its position acts as a candidate solution, which is randomly updated through the optimization process with respect to the best-so-far solution (sun). koa allows for a more effective exploration and exploitation of the search space because the candidate solutions (planets) exhibit different situations from the sun at different times. four challengeable benchmarks, namely cec 2014, cec 2017, cec 2020, and cec2022, and eight constrained engineering design problems, in addition to the parameter estimation problem of photovoltaic modules, were used to assess the performance of koa. to observe its effectiveness, it was compared with three classes of stochastic optimization algorithms, including: (i) the latest published algorithms, including snake optimizer (so), fick's law algorithm (fla), coati optimization algorithm (coa), pelican optimization algorithm (poa), dandelion optimizer (do), mountain gazelle optimizer (mgo), artificial gorilla troops optimizer (gto), and slime mold algorithm (sma); (ii) well-studied and highly cited algorithms, such as whale optimization algorithm (woa) and grey wolf optimizer (gwo); and (iii) two highly performing optimizers: lshade-cnepsin and lshade-spacma. results of the convergence curve and statistical information indicated that koa is more promising than all the compared optimizers. the source code of koa is publicly accessible at https://www.mathworks.com/ matlabcentral/fileexchange/126175-kepler-optimization-algorithm-koapublished by elsevier b.v.",AB_0410
"background: subcellular localization of messenger rna (mrnas) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression, cell migration as well as in cellular adaptation. experiment techniques for pinpointing the subcellular localization of mrnas are laborious, time-consuming and expensive. therefore, in silico approaches for this purpose are attaining great attention in the rna community. methods: in this article, we propose mslp, a machine learning-based method to predict the subcellular localization of mrna. we propose a novel combination of four types of features representing k-mer, pseudo k-tuple nucleotide composition (pseknc), physicochemical properties of nucleotides, and 3d representation of sequences based on z-curve transformation to feed into machine learning algorithm to predict the subcellular localization of mrnas. results: considering the combination of the above-mentioned features, ennsemble-based models achieved state-of-the-art results in mrna subcellular localization prediction tasks for multiple benchmark datasets. we evaluated the performance of our method in ten subcellular locations, covering cytoplasm, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum (er), extracellular region (exr), mitochondria, cytosol, pseudopodium, posterior, exosome, and the ribosome. ablation study highlighted k-mer and pseknc to be more dominant than other features for predicting cytoplasm, nucleus, and er localizations. on the other hand, physicochemical properties and z-curve based features contributed the most to exr and mitochondria detection. shap-based analysis revealed the relative importance of features to provide better insights into the proposed approach. availability: we have implemented a docker container and api for end users to run their sequences on our model. datasets, the code of api and the docker are shared for the community in github at: https://github.com/smusleh/mslp.",AB_0410
"complex protein mixtures typically generate many tandem mass spectra produced by different peptides coisolated in the gas phase. widely adopted proteomic data analysis environments usually fail to identify most of these spectra, succeeding at best in identifying only one of the multiple cofragmenting peptides. we present patternlab v (plv), an updated version of patternlab that integrates the yada 3 deconvolution algorithm to handle such cases efficiently. in general, we expect an increase of 10% in spectral identifications when dealing with complex proteomic samples. plv is freely available at http://patternlabforproteomics.org.",AB_0410
"this work presents a new nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm named spider wasp optimization (swo) algorithm, which is based on replicating the hunting, nesting, and mating behaviors of the female spider wasps in nature. this proposed algorithm has various unique updating strategies, making it applicable to a wide range of optimization problems with different exploration and exploitation requirements. the proposed swo is compared with nine newly published and well-established metaheuristics over four different benchmarks: (1) standard benchmark, including 23 unimodal and multimodal test functions; (2) test suite of cec2017, (3) test suite of cec2020, and (4) test suite of cec2014 to validate its reliability. moreover, two classical engineering design problems, namely, welded bean and pressure vessel designs, and parameter estimation of the single-diode, double-diode, and triple-diode photovoltaic models are used to further evaluate the performance of swo in optimizing real-world optimization problems. experimental findings demonstrate that swo is more competitive compared with the state-of-art meta-heuristic methods for four validated benchmarks and superior to all observed real-world optimization problems. specifically, swo achieves an overall effective percentage of 78.2% on the standard benchmark, 92.31% on cec2014, 77.78% on cec2017, 60% on cec2020, and 100% on real world problems. the source code of swo is publicly available at https://www.mathworks. com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/126010-spider-wasp-optimizer-swo.",AB_0410
"the scale of post-transcriptional regulation and the implications of its interplay with other forms of regulation in environmental acclimation are underexplored for organisms of the domain archaea. here, we have investigated the scale of post-transcriptional regulation in the extremely halophilic archaeon halobacterium salinarum nrc-1 by integrating the transcriptome-wide locations of transcript processing sites (tpss) and smap1 binding, the genome-wide locations of antisense rnas (asrnas), and the consequences of rnase_2099c knockout on the differential expression of all genes. this integrated analysis has discovered that 54% of all protein-coding genes in the genome of this haloarchaeon are likely targeted by multiple mechanisms for putative post-transcriptional processing and regulation, with about 20% of genes likely being regulated by combinatorial schemes involving smap1, asrnas, and rnase_2099c. comparative analysis of mrna levels (transcriptome sequencing [rna-seq]) and protein levels (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry [swath-ms]) for 2,579 genes over four phases of batch culture growth in complex medium generated additional evidence for the conditional post-transcriptional regulation of 7% of all protein-coding genes. we demonstrate that post transcriptional regulation may act to fine-tune specialized and rapid acclimation to stressful environments, e.g., as a switch to turn on gas vesicle biogenesis to promote vertical relocation under anoxic conditions and modulate the frequency of transposition by insertion sequence (is) elements of the is200/is605, is4, and ish3 families. findings from this study are provided as an atlas in a public web resource (https://halodata.systemsbiology.net).importance while the transcriptional regulation landscape of archaea has been extensively investigated, we currently have limited knowledge about post-transcriptional regulation and its driving mechanisms in this domain of life. in this study, we collected and integrated omics data from multiple sources and technologies to infer post -transcriptionally regulated genes and the putative mechanisms modulating their expression at the protein level in halobacterium salinarum nrc-1. the results suggest that post-transcriptional regulation may drive environmental acclimation by regulating hallmark biological processes. to foster discoveries by other research groups interested in the topic, we extended our integrated data to the public in the form of an interactive atlas (https://halodata.systemsbiology.net).",AB_0410
"the first fossil typhlocybinae inclusions from eocene rovno amber are described and illustrated. they include two new monotypic genera of the extinct tribe protodikraneurini, retrorsotettix n. gen. with type species r. vlaskini n. sp. and protoparallaxis n. gen. with type species p. clavatus n. sp. also described and illustrated are two new monotypic genera of the extant tribe dikraneurini, eodikraneura n. gen. with type species e. obscura n. sp. and rovnodikra n. gen. with type species rovnodikra longipes n. sp. retrorsotettix is the oldest leafhopper known to exhibit a false eyespot and false leg markings on the forewing, representing an early acquisition of a defensive strategy against visual predators. appearance of a small insect with false eyespots in the eocene fossil record may reflect increased pressure by visual predators, especially crown ornithuromorph insectivorous birds. such birds and small insect prey with false eyespots remain unknown in the cretaceous. eodikraneura exhibits a unique condition of the hind wing venation in which radius posterior and media anterior veins are confluent for a short distance but then diverge before separately reaching the submarginal vein. this presumably represents a morphological transition between the protodikraneurini, in which hind-wing radius posterior and media anterior veins are completely separate and connected by a radial-medial crossvein, and dikraneurini, in which radius posterior and media anterior veins are completely confluent distally. a key to genera of protodikraneurini is provided.uuid: http://zoobank.org/f15e6f80-9708-4f5e-89a3-705f9d340a77",AB_0410
"sidis-rc evgen is a c++ standalone monte-carlo event generator for studies of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (sidis) processes at medium to high lepton beam energies. in particular, the generator contains binary and library components for generating sidis events and calculating cross sections for unpolarized or longitudinally polarized beam and unpolarized, longitudinally or transversely polarized target. the structure of the generator incorporates transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution and fragmentation functions, whereby we obtain multi-dimensional binned simulation results, which will facilitate the extraction of important information about the three-dimensional nucleon structure from sidis measurements. in order to build this software, we have used recent elaborate qed calculations of the lowest-order radiative effects, applied to the leading order born cross section in sidis. in this paper, we provide details on the theoretical formalism as well as the construction and operation of sidis-rc evgen, e.g., how we handle the event generation process and perform multi-dimensional integration. we also provide example programs, flowcharts, and numerical results on azimuthal transverse single -spin asymmetries.program summary program title: sidis-rc evgen cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /thrkn96ydd .1 licensing provisions:gnu general public license version 3 developer's repository link: https://github .com /duanebyer /sidis programming language: c++, python external packages: foam, root, gsl, vegas, cubature, cog, ww-sidis, mstwpdf nature of problem: the task is to first create a code for calculations of the leading order born cross section as well as radiative corrections (rcs) at the next-to-leading order (nlo) of the cross section of lepton-hadron semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (sidis) at medium to high beam energies with incident unpolarized or longitudinally polarized lepton beam and unpolarized, longitudinally or transversely polarized target, enabling to compute azimuthal single-target and double-beam-target spin asymmetries. afterwards, a monte-carlo event generator based upon this code is developed, where in the coding and simulation processes multi-dimensional integrals need to be calculated precisely to obtain the exact nlo rcs to the sidis cross section with high precision beyond ultra-relativistic limit, which means that the lepton mass is taken into account.",AB_0410
"ltr-retrotransposons (ltr-rts) are a large group of transposable elements that replicate through an rna intermediate and alter genome structure. the activities of ltr-rts in plant genomes provide helpful information about genome evolution and gene function. ltr-rts near or within genes can directly alter gene function. this work introduces plantltrdb, an intact ltr-rt database for 195 plant species. using homology- and de novo structure-based methods, a total of 150.18 gbp representing 3,079,469 pseudomolecules/scaffolds were analyzed to identify, characterize, annotate ltr-rts, estimate insertion ages, detect ltr-rt-gene chimeras, and determine nearby genes. accordingly, 520,194 intact ltr-rts were discovered, including 29,462 autonomous and 490,732 nonautonomous ltr-rts. the autonomous ltr-rts included 10,286 gypsy and 19,176 copia, while the nonautonomous were divided into 224,906 gypsy, 218,414 copia, 1,768 bare-2, 3,147 tr-gag and 4,2497 unknown. analysis of the identified ltr-rts located within genes showed that a total of 36,236 ltr-rts were ltr-rt-gene chimeras and 11,619 ltr-rts were within pseudo-genes. in addition, 50,026 genes are within 1 kbp of ltr-rts, and 250,587 had a distance of 1 to 10 kbp from ltr-rts. plantltrdb allows researchers to search, visualize, blast and analyze plant ltr-rts. plantltrdb can contribute to the understanding of structural variations, genome organization, functional genomics, and the development of ltr-rt target markers for molecular plant breeding. plantltrdb is available at https://bioinformatics.um6p.ma/plantltrdb.",AB_0410
