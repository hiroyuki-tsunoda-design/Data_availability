"the products of non-canonical isocyanide synthase (ics) biosynthetic gene clusters (bgcs) mediate pathogenesis, microbial competition, and metal-homeostasis through metal-associated chemistry. we sought to enable research into this class of compounds by characterizing the biosynthetic potential and evolutionar y history of these bgcs across the fungal kingdom. we amalgamated a pipeline of tools to predict bgcs based on shared promoter motifs and located 3800 ics bgcs in 3300 genomes, making ics bgcs the fifth largest class of specialized metabolites compared to canonical classes found by antismash. ics bgcs are not evenly distributed across fungi, with evidence of gene-family expansions in several ascomycete families. we show that the ics dit1/2 gene cluster family (gcf), which was prior only studied in yeast, is present in similar to 30% of all ascomycetes. the dit variety ics exhibits greater similarity to bacterial ics than other fungal ics, suggesting a potential convergence of the ics backbone domain. the evolutionary origins of the dit gcf in ascomycota are ancient and these genes are diversifying in some lineages. our results create a roadmap for future research into ics bgcs. we developed a website (https:// isocyanides.fungi.wisc.edu/) that facilitates the exploration and downloading of all identified fungal ics bgcs and gcfs.

"recent advances in nucleic acid sequencingnow permit rapid andgenome-scale analysis of genetic variation and transcription, enablingpopulation-scale studies of human biology, disease, and diverse organisms.likewise, advances in mass spectrometry proteomics now permit highlysensitive and accurate studies of protein expression at the wholeproteome-scale. however, most proteomic studies rely on consensusdatabases to match spectra to peptide and protein sequences, and thusremain limited to the analysis of canonical protein sequences. here,we develop proteomegenerator2 (pg2), based on the scalable and modularproteomegenerator framework. pg2 integrates genome and transcriptomesequencing to incorporate protein variants containing amino acid substitutions,insertions, and deletions, as well as noncanonical reading frames,exons, and other variants caused by genomic and transcriptomic variation.we benchmarked pg2 using synthetic data and genomic, transcriptomic,and proteomic analysis of human leukemia cells. pg2 can be integratedwith current and emerging sequencing technologies, assemblers, variantcallers, and mass spectral analysis algorithms, and is available open-sourcefrom https://github.com/kentsisresearchgroup/proteomegenerator2.",AB_0607
"data-independent acquisition (dia) mass spectrometry methods provide systematic and comprehensive quantification of the proteome; yet, relatively few open-source tools are available to analyze dia proteomics experiments. fewer still are tools that can leverage gas phase fractionated (gpf) chromatogram libraries to enhance the detection and quantification of peptides in these experiments. here, we present nf-encyclopedia, an open-source nextflow pipeline that connects three open-source tools, msconvert, encyclopedia, and msstats, to analyze dia proteomics experiments with or without chromatogram libraries. we demonstrate that nf-encyclopedia is reproducible when run on either a cloud platform or a local workstation and provides robust peptide and protein quantification. additionally, we found that msstats enhances protein-level quantitative performance over encyclopedia alone. finally, we benchmarked the ability of nf-encyclopedia to scale to large experiments in the cloud by leveraging the parallelization of compute resources. the nf-encyclopedia pipeline is available under a permissive apache 2.0 license; run it on your desktop, cluster, or in the cloud: https://github.com/talusbio/nf-encyclopedia.",AB_0607
"future action anticipation aims to infer future actions from the observation of a small set of past video frames. in this paper, we propose a novel jointly-learnt action anticipation network (j-aan) via self-knowledge distillation (self-kd) and cycle consistency for future action anticipation. in contrast to the current state-of-the-art methods which anticipate the future actions either directly or recursively, our proposed j-aan anticipates the future actions jointly in both direct and recursive ways. however, when dealing with future action anticipation, one important challenge to address is the future's uncertainty since multiple action sequences may come from or be followed by the same action. training an action anticipation model with one-hot-encoded hard labels that assign zero probabilities to incorrect yet semantically similar actions may not handle the uncertain future. to address this challenge, we design a self-kd mechanism to train our j-aan, where the j-aan gradually distills its own knowledge during the training to soften the hard labels to model the uncertainty on future action anticipation. furthermore, we design a forward and backward action anticipation framework with our proposed j-aan based on a cyclic consistency constraint. the forward j-aan anticipates the future actions from the observed past actions, and the backward j-aan verifies the anticipation of the forward j-aan by anticipating the past actions from the anticipated future actions. the proposed method outperforms all the latest state-of-the-art action anticipation methods on the breakfast, 50salads, and epic-kitchens-55 datasets. this project will be publicly available on https://github.com/moniruzzamanmd/j-aan.",AB_0607
"one influential framework for examining human moral cognition has been a dual process model, in which utilitarian judgment (e.g., infliction of harm for the greater good) is associated with cognitive control processes, while non-utilitarian judgment (e.g., avoiding such harms) is associated with emotional, automatic processes. another framework of moral cognition, the twodimensional model of utilitarian psychology, posits that utilitarian choices may reflect either instrumental harm, i.e., inflicting harm on an individual for the greater good; or impartial beneficence, i.e., impartially and altruistically acting for the benefit of the overall welfare. we evaluated preregistered hypotheses (https://osf.io/m425d) derived from these models of moral cognition in a sample of 275 neurologically healthy older adults. our results suggest that both the dual process and two-dimensional models provided insights regarding utilitarian reasoning, including three cardinal domains of conflict between utilitarianism and common-sense morality: agent-centered permissions, special obligations, and personal rights. one prediction of the dual process-based model was supported by our findings, with higher emotionality associated with decreased endorsement of utilitarian judgments (b = - 0.12, p < .001). we also found partial support for the two-dimensional model, as utilitarian judgments about dilemmas involving agentcentered permissions and personal rights were dissociated; however, both sets of judgments were associated with utilitarian judgments involving special obligations (p < .001 and p = .008, respectively). we propose that our findings, with support for some elements of the dual process and two-dimensional models, can be integrated into a revised two-dimensional model of utilitarian judgment as including impartial beneficence and acceptance of attributable harms.",AB_0607
"study objectives: to examine beliefs about prescription sleep medications (hypnotics) among individuals with insomnia disorder seeking cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and predictors of wishing to reduce use. methods: baseline data was collected from 245 adults 50 years and older enrolled in the rct of the effectiveness of stepped-care sleep therapy in general practice study. t-tests compared characteristics of prescription sleep medication users with those of nonusers. linear regression assessed predictors of patients' beliefs about sleep medication necessity and hypnotic-related concerns. among users, we examined predictors of wishing to reduce sleep medications, including perceived hypnotic dependence, beliefs about medications, and demographic characteristics. results: users endorsed stronger beliefs about the necessity of sleep medications and less concern about potential harms than nonusers (p < .01). stronger dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions predicted greater beliefs about necessity and concern about use (p < .01). patients wishing to reduce sleep medications reported greater perceived hypnotic dependence than those disinterested in reduction (p < .001). self-reported dependence severity was the strongest predictor of wishing to reduce use (p = .002). conclusions: despite expressing strong beliefs about necessity, and comparatively less concern about taking sleep medications, three-quarters of users wished to reduce prescription hypnotics. results may not generalize to individuals with insomnia not seeking nonpharmacological treatments. upon completion, the rct of the effectiveness of stepped-care sleep therapy in general practice study will provide information about the extent to which therapist-led and digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia contribute to prescription hypnotic reduction. clinical trial registration: registry: clinicaltrials.gov; name: the resting insomnia study: randomized controlled study on effectiveness of stepped-care sleep therapy (resting); url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03532282; identifier: nct03532282.",AB_0607
"study objectives: restless legs syndrome (rls) is a prevalent sleep disorder with limited treatment options. bilateral high-frequency noninvasive peroneal nerve stimulation (npns) reduces rls symptoms. here, we sought to characterize the mechanism of action for npns and identify predictors of treatment response. we hypothesized that, similar to voluntary leg movements, npns reduces rls symptoms by activating leg muscles. methods: for 20 adults with moderate-severe rls, we tested this hypothesis by recording surface electromyography (emg) from the tibialis anterior leg muscle while administering npns at varying amplitudes to determine the minimum npns amplitude that evoked emg activity (motor threshold) and maximal npns amplitude that was not distracting (therapeutic intensity level). afterwards, participants self-administered npns (at the therapeutic intensity level) and sham control for 14 days, each in randomized order. efficacy was defined as international rls study group rating scale (irls) score difference for npns compared with sham. results: npns consistently activated leg muscles; npns evoked emg activity at the therapeutic intensity level for 19 of 20 participants (mean til: 26.6 ma, mean mt: 18.3 ma). evoked emg activity was tonic (not phasic) and sustained over time. evoked emg activity predicted efficacy; participants with lower motor thresholds had greater irls improvement (r = .45, p = .046). npns treatment did not interfere with self-reported sleep onset (npns: 16% of nights; sham: 11%; p = .629) and frequently improved self-reported sleep onset (npns: 52% of nights; sham: 15%; p = .002). conclusions: these results demonstrate that npns reduces rls symptoms by activating afferent pathways, thereby generating tonic and sustained leg muscle activity without interfering with sleep. clinical trial registration: registry: clinicaltrials.gov; name: noninvasive peripheral nerve stimulation for restless legs syndrome; url: https://clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/nct04700683; identifier: nct04700683.",AB_0607
"objective depression and anxiety are associated with inferior outcomes following spine surgery. in this study, the authors examined whether patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (csm) who have both self-reported depression (srd) and self-reported anxiety (sra) have worse postoperative patient-reported outcomes (pros) compared with pa-tients who have only one or none of these comorbidities.methods this study is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the quality outcomes database csm cohort. comparisons were made among patients who reported the following: 1) either srd or sra, 2) both srd and sra, or 3) neither comorbidity at baseline. pros at 3, 12, and 24 months (scores for the visual analog scale [vas] for neck pain and arm pain, neck disability index [ndi], modified japanese orthopaedic association [mjoa] scale, eq-5d, euroqol vas [eq-vas], and north american spine society [nass] patient satisfaction index) and achievement of respective pro minimal clinically important differences (mcids) were compared.results of the 1141 included patients, 199 (17.4%) had either srd or sra alone, 132 (11.6%) had both srd and sra, and 810 (71.0%) had neither. preoperatively, patients with either srd or sra alone had worse scores for vas neck pain (5.6 & plusmn; 3.1 vs 5.1 & plusmn; 3.3, p = 0.03), ndi (41.0 & plusmn; 19.3 vs 36.8 & plusmn; 20.8, p = 0.007), eq-vas (57.0 & plusmn; 21.0 vs 60.7 & plusmn; 21.7, p = 0.03), and eq-5d (0.53 & plusmn; 0.23 vs 0.58 & plusmn; 0.21, p = 0.008) than patients without such disorders. postopera-tively, in multivariable adjusted analyses, baseline srd or sra alone was associated with inferior improvement in the vas neck pain score and a lower rate of achieving the mcid for vas neck pain score at 3 and 12 months, but not at 24 months. at 24 months, patients with srd or sra alone experienced less change in eq-5d scores and were less likely to meet the mcid for eq-5d than patients without srd or sra. furthermore, patient self-reporting of both psychologi-cal comorbidities did not impact pros at all measured time points compared with self-reporting of only one psychologi-cal comorbidity alone. each cohort (srd or sra alone, both srd and sra, and neither srd nor sra) experienced significant improvements in mean pros at all measured time points compared with baseline (p < 0.05). conclusions approximately 12% of patients who underwent surgery for csm presented with both srd and sra, and 29% presented with at least one symptom. the presence of either srd or sra was independently associated with inferior scores for 3-and 12-month neck pain following surgery, but this difference was not significant at 24 months. however, at long-term follow-up, patients with srd or sra experienced lower quality of life than patients without srd or sra. the comorbid presence of both depression and anxiety was not associated with worse patient outcomes than either diagnosis alone. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2023.2.spine22685",AB_0607

"study objectives: the potential sedative effect of dronabinol and the high expression of cannabinoid receptors on the hypoglossal motor nuclei makes this agent a good candidate for obstructive sleep apnea (osa) pharmacotherapy to be tested with atomoxetine, a noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor that reduced osa severity in combination with oxybutynin. here we tested the effect of atomoxetine 80 mg plus dronabinol (ato-dro) at 2 different doses (5 and 10 mg) vs. baseline and atomoxetine alone in a 2-center, open-label, dose-escalating trial. the primary outcome was the effect of ato-dro vs. baseline on osa severity (apnea-hypopnea index, hypopneas associated with 4% oxygen desaturation). safety of the combination and self-reported outcomes were also assessed. methods: fifteen patients with osa received progressively increasing ato-dro doses (dose escalation was performed every week, starting from ato-dro 40-2.5 mg, then 80-5 mg and finally 80-10 mg). a clinical, in-lab polysomnography was performed at baseline, on ato-dro 80-5 and ato-dro 80-10 mg. results: ato-dro 80-10 mg did not significantly reduce apnea-hypopnea index, hypopneas associated with 4% oxygen desaturation, and hypoxic burden and yielded limited clinical benefit vs. baseline and atomoxetine alone. however, ato-dro 80-5 mg did improve osa severity (dapnea-hypopnea index = 8.3[0.3, 16.3] events/h; mean [confidence interval]; dhypoxic burden = 37.7[12.5, 62.7] %min/h) and multiple self-reported outcomes vs. baseline and/or atomoxetine alone. ato-dro administration was characterized by several potentially harmful side effects and treatment discontinuation in 1/3 of cases. conclusions: ato-dro 80-5 mg might be useful to reduce osa severity and lead to self-reported improvement in those who could tolerate the combination. however, given the numerous side effects and the exploratory nature of this open-label study, our results warrant further validation in larger trials. clinical trial registration: registry: clinicaltrials.gov; title: study for efficacy and dose escalation of ad313 + atomoxetine (seed) (seed); url: https:// clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct05101122; identifier: nct05101122.",AB_0607
