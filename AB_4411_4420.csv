"text. we present a general algorithm for solving all two-variable polynomial diophantine equations consisting of three monomials. before this work, even the existence of an algorithm for solving the one-parameter family of equations x4+axy +y3 = 0 has been an open question. we also present an elementary method that reduces the task of finding all integer solutions to a general three-monomial equation to the task of finding primitive solutions to equations with three monomials in disjoint variables. we identify a large class of three-monomial equations for which this method leads to a complete solution. empirical data suggests that this class contains 100% of three-monomial equations as the number of variables goes to infinity.video. for a video summary of this paper, please visit https://youtu .be /ansjvftmdce.& copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier inc. this is an open access article under the cc by license ( .org /licenses /by /4 .0/).",AB_0442
"malignant mesothelioma is a difficult to diagnose and highly lethal cancer usually associated with asbestos exposure. it can be broadly classified into three subtypes: epithelioid, sarcomatoid, and a hybrid biphasic subtype in which significant components of both of the previous subtypes are present. early diagnosis and identification of the subtype informs treatment and can help improve patient outcome. however, the subtyping of malignant mesothelioma, and specifically the recognition of transitional features from routine histology slides has a high level of inter-observer variability. in this work, we propose an end-to-end multiple instance learning (mil) approach for malignant mesothe-lioma subtyping. this uses an adaptive instance-based sampling scheme for training deep convolutional neural networks on bags of image patches that allows learning on a wider range of relevant instances compared to max or top-n based mil approaches. we also investigate augmenting the instance representation to include aggregate cellular morphology features from cell segmentation. the proposed mil approach enables identifica-tion of malignant mesothelial subtypes of specific tissue regions. from this a continuous characterisation of a sample according to predominance of sarcomatoid vs epithelioid regions is possible, thus avoiding the arbitrary and highly subjective categorisation by currently used subtypes. instance scoring also enables studying tumor heterogeneity and identifying patterns associated with different subtypes. we have evaluated the proposed method on a dataset of 234 tissue micro-array cores with an auroc of 0.89 & plusmn;0.05 for this task. the dataset and developed methodology is available for the community at: https://github.com/measty/pins.",AB_0442
"backgroundindia has made steady progress in improving rates of primary school enrolment but levels of learning achievement remain low. the support to rural india's public education system (stripes) trial provided evidence that an after-school para-teacher intervention improved numeracy and literacy levels in telangana, india. the stripes2 trial investigates whether such an intervention will have a similar effect on the literacy and numeracy of primary school age children in the satna district of madhya pradesh, india.methods/designthe stripes2 trial forms one part of a cluster-randomised controlled trial with villages (clusters) randomised to receive either a health (champion2) or education (stripes2) intervention. building on the design of the earlier champion/stripes trial, villages receiving the health intervention are controls for the education intervention and vice versa. the primary outcome is a combined literacy and numeracy score. secondary outcomes include separate scores for literacy and numeracy; caregivers' engagement with child's learning; expenditure on education; enrolment in school; caregiver's report of school attendance and the cost effectiveness of the intervention. over 7000 primary school age children have been recruited and randomised in stripes2.discussionthis update to the published trial protocol gives a detailed plan for the statistical analysis of the stripes 2 trial.trial registrationregistry of india: ctri/2019/05/019296. registered on 23 may 2019. http://www.ctri.nic.in/clinicaltrials/pdf_generate.php?trialid=31198&enchid=&modid=&compid=%27,%2731198det%27",AB_0442
"salient object detection plays an important role in many downstream tasks. however, complex real-world scenes with varying scales and numbers of salient objects still pose a challenge. in this paper, we directly address the problem of detecting multiple salient objects across complex scenes. we propose a network architecture incorporating non-local feature information in both the spatial and channel spaces, capturing the long-range dependencies between separate objects. traditional bottom-up and non-local features are combined with edge features within a feature fusion gate that progressively refines the salient object prediction in the decoder. we show that our approach accurately locates multiple salient regions even in complex scenarios. to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach to the multiple salient objects problem, we curate a new dataset containing only multiple salient objects. our experiments demonstrate the proposed method presents stateof-the-art results on five widely used datasets without any pre-processing and post-processing. we obtain a further performance improvement against competing techniques on our multi-objects dataset. the dataset and source code are available at: https://github.com/ericdengbowen/dslrdnet.",AB_0442
"designs for scaffolded dna origami nanostructures are commonly and minimally published as the list of dna staple and scaffold sequences required. in nearly all cases, high-level editable design files (e.g. cadnano) which generated the low-level sequences are not made available. this de facto 'raw sequence' exchange format allows published origami designs to be re-attempted in the laboratory by other groups, but effectively stops designs from being significantly modified or re-purposed for new future applications. to make the raw sequence exchange format more accessible to further design and engineering, in this work we propose the first algorithmic solution to the inverse problem of converting staple/scaffold sequences back to a 'guide schematic' resembling the original origami schematic. the guide schematic can be used to aid the manual re-input of an origami into a cad tool like cadnano, hence recovering a high-level editable design file. creation of a guide schematic can also be used to double check that a list of staple strand sequences does not have errors and indeed does assemble into a desired origami nanostructure prior to costly laboratory experimentation. we tested our reverse algorithm on 36 diverse origami designs from the literature and found that 29 origamis (81 %) had a good quality guide sche-matic recovered from raw sequences. our software is made available at https://revnano.readthedocs.io.",AB_0442
"antibodies with similar amino acid sequences, especially across their complementarity-determining regions, often share properties. finding that an antibody of interest has a similar sequence to naturally expressed antibodies in healthy or diseased repertoires is a powerful approach for the prediction of antibody properties, such as immunogenicity or antigen specificity. however, as the number of available antibody sequences is now in the billions and continuing to grow, repertoire mining for similar sequences has become increasingly computationally expensive. existing approaches are limited by either being low-throughput, non-exhaustive, not antibody specific, or only searching against entire chain sequences. therefore, there is a need for a specialized tool, optimized for a rapid and exhaustive search of any antibody region against all known antibodies, to better utilize the full breadth of available repertoire sequences. we introduce known antibody search (ka-search), a tool that allows for the rapid search of billions of antibody variable domains by amino acid sequence identity across either the variable domain, the complementarity-determining regions, or a user defined antibody region. we show ka-search in operation on the similar to 2.4 billion antibody sequences available in the oas database. ka-search can be used to find the most similar sequences from oas within 30 minutes and a representative subset of 10 million sequences in less than 9 seconds. we give examples of how ka-search can be used to obtain new insights about an antibody of interest. ka-search is freely available at https://github.com/oxpig/kasearch.",AB_0442
"motivation: molecular dynamics (md) simulations have become routine tools for the study of protein dynamics and function. thanks to faster gpu-based algorithms, atomistic and coarse-grained simulations are being used to explore biological functions over the microsecond timescale, yielding terabytes of data spanning multiple trajectories, thereby extracting relevant protein conformations without losing important information is often challenging. results: we present mdsubsampler, a python library and toolkit for a posteriori subsampling of data from multiple trajectories. this toolkit provides access to uniform, random, stratified, weighted sampling, and bootstrapping sampling methods. sampling can be performed under the constraint of preserving the original distribution of relevant geometrical properties. possible applications include simulations post-processing, noise reduction, and structures selection for ensemble docking. availability and implementation: mdsubsampler is freely available at https://github.com/alepandini/mdsubsampler, along with guidance on installation and tutorials on how it can be used.",AB_0442
"background: considerable comorbidity exists between insomnia and anxiety, and evidence shows that the benefits of cbt for insomnia extend to anxiety. using data from two large trials of digital cbt (dcbt) for insomnia, we evaluated whether improving sleep is an effective treatment target to reduce both insomnia and anxiety symptoms in individuals with insomnia and clinically significant anxiety.methods: this was a controlled sub-analysis combining individual participant data from two previous randomised controlled trials of dcbt for insomnia (sleepio). participants (n = 2172) with insomnia disorder and clinically significant anxiety symptoms were included in this sub-analysis and received either dcbt or control (usual care or sleep hygiene education). assessments were evaluated at baseline, post-intervention (week 8 or 10), and follow-up (week 22 or 24). mediation was evaluated using structural equation models.results: dcbt for insomnia was superior to control at reducing both insomnia (hedges' g range = 0.77-0.81; both p < 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (hedges' g range = 0.39-0.44; both p < 0.001) at all time points. baseline insomnia symptoms moderated the effects of dcbt on insomnia, however no variables moderated treatment effects on anxiety. reductions in anxiety symptoms at follow-up were mediated by improvements in sleep at postintervention (% mediated = 84 %), suggesting a causal pathway.limitations: participants did not have a formal anxiety disorder diagnosis and so the effects of dcbt for insomnia on anxiety may differ by anxiety disorder.conclusions: addressing sleep using dcbt for insomnia may serve as a treatment target from which to improve anxiety in individuals with insomnia and clinically significant comorbid anxiety. clinical trial registrations: digital insomnia therapy to assist your life as well as your sleep (dials) isrctn60530898 http://www.isrctn.com/isrctn60530898. oxford access for students improving sleep (oasis) - isrctn61272251 http://www.isrctn.com/isrct n61272251.",AB_0442
"motivation: genome-wide association studies (gwas) have been successful in identifying genomic loci associated with complex traits. genetic fine-mapping aims to detect independent causal variants from the gwas-identified loci, adjusting for linkage disequilibrium patterns. results: we present finimom (fine-mapping using a product inverse-moment prior), a novel bayesian fine-mapping method for summarized genetic associations. for causal effects, the method uses a nonlocal inverse-moment prior, which is a natural prior distribution to model non-null effects in finite samples. a beta-binomial prior is set for the number of causal variants, with a parameterization that can be used to control for potential misspecifications in the linkage disequilibrium reference. the results of simulations studies aimed to mimic a typical gwas on circulating protein levels show improved credible set coverage and power of the proposed method over current state-of-the-art fine-mapping method susie, especially in the case of multiple causal variants within a locus. availability and implementation: https://vkarhune.github.io/finimom/.",AB_0442
"camera image simulation is integral to the virtual validation of autonomous vehicles and robots that use visual perception to understand their environment. it also has applications in creating image datasets for training learning-based vision models. as camera image simulation takes into account a wide variety of external and internal parameters, achieving a high-fidelity simulation is a computationally expensive process. recently, several neural network-based techniques have been proposed to reduce the computational complexity of image rendering, a critical element of the camera simulation pipeline. however, the existing methods are tailored for monocular camera images and are not optimised for stereo images, which are widely used in autonomous driving applications. to address this, we propose a technique based on stereo super resolution (ssr) to speed up the simulation of stereo images. the proposed method first simulates stereo images at a lower resolution, then super-resolves them to their original resolution using our introduced ssr model, etssr. we evaluated the performance of our technique using the carla driving simulator and created our own synthetic dataset for training etssr. the evaluations indicate that our approach can speed up stereo image simulation by a factor of up to 2.57 over various resolutions. moreover, it shows that our etssr achieves on-par or superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art models, using significantly fewer parameters and flops. we have made our source code and dataset available at https://github.com/hamedhaghighi/etssr.",AB_0442
