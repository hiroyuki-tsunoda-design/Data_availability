"in this paper, we address the problem of estimating remaining surgery duration (rsd) from surgical video frames. we propose a bayesian long short-term memory (lstm) network-based deep negative correlation learning approach called bd-net for accurate regression of rsd prediction as well as estimation of prediction uncertainty. our method aims to extract discriminative visual features from surgical video frames and model the temporal dependencies among frames to improve the rsd prediction accuracy. to this end, we propose to train an ensemble of bayesian lstms on top of a backbone network by the way of deep negative correlation learning (dncl). more specifically, we deeply learn a pool of decorrelated bayesian regressors with sound generalization capabilities through managing their intrinsic diversities. bd-net is simple and efficient. after training, it can produce both rsd prediction and uncertainty estimation in a single inference run. we demonstrate the efficacy of bd-net on publicly available datasets of two different types of surgeries: one containing 101 cataract microscopic surgeries with short durations and the other containing 80 cholecystectomy laparoscopic surgeries with relatively longer durations. experimental results on both datasets demonstrate that the proposed bd-net achieves better results than the state-of-the-art (sota) methods. a reference implementation of our method can be found at: https://github.com/jywu511/bd-net.",AB_0216
"the airport surface surveillance system is essential in ensuring airport safety and maximizing the efficient utilization of airport resources. current airport detection algorithms suffer from few and lack relevant airport target data. to solve these issues, this paper establishes two airport datasets named ass-dataset, including the surveillance dataset and the panoramic surveillance dataset. compared to other aircraft datasets, our datasets are collected from authentic airport surface surveillance systems. according to observation, most objects are small in datasets. this paper proposes a small object detectionmethod assd-yolo based on improved yolov7. first, the designed f-efficient attention module is added to the backbone network to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. second, the transformer encoder network is incorporated into the backbone network to increase feature extraction. finally, the small target detection layer is added to the head network to improve the ability to extract small targets. the model of the mean average precision is 93.5% in the surveillance dataset. in the panoramic surveillance dataset, the assd-yolo achieves 10.8% and 21.4% higher average precision for the airplane and truck than yolov7. g. comparing the method proposed in this paper to the originalyolov7, the performance improvement for themapis 4.6% when using the rsod open dataset. ass-dataset is available at https://github.com/rookie257/rookie257. github.io. code is available at https://github.com/rookie257/small_detection.github.io.",AB_0216
"biometric authentication technologies are rapidly gaining popularity, and hand gestures are emerging as a promising biometric trait due to their rich physiological and behavioral characteristics. hand gesture authentication can be categorized as defined hand gesture authentication and random hand gesture authenti-cation. unlike defined hand gesture authentication, random hand gesture authentication is not constrained to specific hand gesture types, allowing users to perform hand gestures randomly during enrollment and verification, thus more flexible and friendly. however, in random hand gesture authentication, the model needs to extract more generalized physiological and behavioral features from different viewpoints and positions without gesture templates, which is more challenging. in this paper, we present a novel efficient temporal -segment-set-network (ts2n) that directly extracts both behavioral and physiological features from a single rgb video to further enhance the performance of random hand gesture authentication. our method adopts a new motion pseudo-modality and leverages a set-based representation to capture behavioral characteristics online. additionally, we propose a channel-spatial attention mechanism, contextual squeeze-and-excitation network (cosen), to better abstract and understand physiological characteristics by explicitly modeling the channel-spatial interdependence, thereby adaptively recalibrating channel-specific and spatial-specific responses. extensive experiments on the largest public hand gesture authentication dataset scut-dhga demonstrate ts2n's superiority against 21 state-of-the-art models in terms of eer (5.707% for full version and 6.664% for lite version) and computational cost (98.9022g for full version and 46.3741g for lite version). the code is available at https://github.com/scut-bip-lab/ts2n.",AB_0216
"the intrinsic mechanism of postherpetic neuralgia (phn) remains unclear. herein, we aimed to seek the hub proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf), which display significant changes between the phn and nonpainful patients (control). first, the proteomic results showed that compared with the control-csf, there were 100 upregulated and 50 downregulated differentially expressed proteins (deps) in the phn-csf. besides, functional analyses including gene ontology (go), kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg), and gene set enrichment analysis (gsea) revealed that biological processes and pathways including complement activation, infection, coagulation, and lipid metabolism were activated, while synaptic organization was suppressed. next, the protein-protein interaction (ppi) analysis indicated that increased plg, f2, apoa1, apoa2, serpinc1, and kng1 and reduced apoe, which were all enriched in the top pathways according to the kegg analysis, were defined as hub proteins. finally, three of the hub proteins, such as plg, apoa1, and apoe, were reconfirmed in a larger cohort using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and western blotting methods. above all, the results indicated that plg, apoa1, and apoe and their involved processes such as infection, inflammation, cholesterol metabolism, and coagulation shall be potential therapeutic approaches.

"backgroundliquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is widely used in untargeted metabolomics for composition profiling. in multi-run analysis scenarios, features of each run are aligned into consensus features by feature alignment algorithms to observe the intensity variations across runs. however, most of the existing feature alignment methods focus more on accurate retention time correction, while underestimating the importance of feature matching. none of the existing methods can comprehensively consider feature correspondences among all runs and achieve optimal matching.resultsto comprehensively analyze feature correspondences among runs, we propose g-aligner, a graph-based feature alignment method for untargeted lc-ms data. in the feature matching stage, g-aligner treats features and potential correspondences as nodes and edges in a multipartite graph, considers the multi-run feature matching problem an unbalanced multidimensional assignment problem, and provides three combinatorial optimization algorithms to find optimal matching solutions. in comparison with the feature alignment methods in openms, mzmine2 and xcms on three public metabolomics benchmark datasets, g-aligner achieved the best feature alignment performance on all the three datasets with up to 9.8% and 26.6% increase in accurately aligned features and analytes, and helped all comparison software obtain more accurate results on their self-extracted features by integrating g-aligner to their analysis workflow. g-aligner is open-source and freely available at https://github.com/csi-studio/g-aligner under a permissive license. benchmark datasets, manual annotation results, evaluation methods and results are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8313034conclusionsin this study, we proposed g-aligner to improve feature matching accuracy for untargeted metabolomics lc-ms data. g-aligner comprehensively considered potential feature correspondences between all runs, converting the feature matching problem as a multidimensional assignment problem (map). in evaluations on three public metabolomics benchmark datasets, g-aligner achieved the highest alignment accuracy on manual annotated and popular software extracted features, proving the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm.",AB_0216
"positioning technology is an important component of environmental perception. it is also the basis for autonomous decision-making and motion control of firefighting robots. however, some issues such as positioning in indoor scenarios still remain inherent challenges. the positioning accuracy of the fire emergency reaction dispatching (ferd) system is far from adequate to support some applications for firefighting and rescue in indoor scenarios with multiple obstacles. to solve this problem, this paper proposes a fusion module based on the blackboard architecture. this module aims to improve the positioning accuracy of a single sensor of the unmanned vehicles within the ferd system. to reduce the risk of autonomous decision-making of the unmanned vehicles, this module uses a comprehensive manner of multiple channels to complement or correct the positioning of the firefighting robots. specifically, this module has been developed to fusion a variety of relevant processes for precise positioning. this process mainly includes six strategies. these strategies are the denoising, spatial alignment, confidence degree update, observation filtering, data fusion, and fusion decision. these strategies merge with the current scenarios-related parameter data, empirical data on sensor errors, and information to form a series of norms. this paper then proceeds to gain experience data with the confidence degree, error of different sensors, and timeliness of this module by training in an indoor scenario with multiple obstacles. this process is from data of multiple sensors (bottom-level) to control decisions knowledge-based (up-level). this process can obtain globally optimal positioning results. finally, this paper evaluates the performance of this fusion module for the ferd system. the experimental results show that this fusion module can effectively improve positioning accuracy in an indoor scenario with multiple obstacles. code is available at https://github.com/lvbingyu-zeze/gopath/tree/master.",AB_0216

"although more and more attention has been focused on introns and the important role of plant introns in plant growth and development has been discovered, there is still a lack of an open and comprehensive database on plant introns with functional elements in current research. in order to make full use of large-scale sequencing data and help researchers in related fields to achieve high-throughput functional verification of identified plant introns with functional elements, we designed a database containing five plant species, plantintrondb and systematically analyzed 358, 59, 185, 210 and 141 rna-seq samples from arabidopsis thaliana (arabidopsis), gossypium raimondii (cotton), zea mays (maize), brassica napus (oilseed rape) and oryza sativa japonica group (rice). in total, we found 100 126 introns that host functional elements in these five species. specifically, we found that among all species, the number of introns with functional elements on the positive and negative strands is similar, with a length mostly smaller than 1500 bp, and the adenine/thymine (a/t) content is much higher than that of guanine/cytosine (g/c). in addition, the distribution of functional elements in introns varies among different species. all the above data can be downloaded for free in this database. this database provides a concise, comprehensive and user-friendly web interface, allowing users to easily retrieve target data based on their needs, using relevant organizational options. the database operation is simple and convenient, aiming to provide strong data support for researchers in related fields to study plant introns that host functional elements, including circular rnas, lncrnas, etc.database url: http://deepbiology.cn/plantintrondb/",AB_0216
