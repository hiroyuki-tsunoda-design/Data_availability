"n4-methylcytosine (4mc) is an important epigenetic mechanism, which regulates many cellular processes such as cell differentiation and gene expression. the knowledge about the 4mc sites is a key foundation to exploring its roles. due to the limitation of techniques, precise detection of 4mc is still a challenging task. in this paper, we presented a multi-scale convolution neural network (cnn) and adaptive embedding based computational method for predicting 4mc sites in mouse genome, which was referred to as multiscale-cnn-4mcpred. the multiscale-cnn-4mcpred used adaptive embedding to encode nucleotides, and then utilized multi-scale cnns as well as long short-term memory to extract more in-depth local properties and contextual semantics in the sequences. the multiscale-cnn-4mcpred is an end-to-end learning method, which requires no sophisticated feature design. the multiscale-cnn-4mcpred reached an accuracy of 81.66% in the 10-fold cross-validation, and an accuracy of 84.69% in the independent test, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. we implemented the proposed method into a user-friendly web application which is freely available at: http:// www.biolscience.cn/multiscale-cnn-4mcpred/.",AB_0263
"image super-resolution (sr) significantly improves the quality of low-resolution images, and is widely used for image reconstruction in various fields. although the existing sr methods have achieved distinguished results in objective metrics, most methods focus on real-world images and employ large and complex network structures, which are inefficient for medical diagnosis scenarios. to address the aforementioned issues, the distinction between pathology images and real-world images was investigated, and an sr network with a wider and deeper attention module called channel attention retention is proposed to obtain sr images with enhanced highfrequency features. this network captures contextual information within and across blocks via residual skips and balances the performance and efficiency by controlling the number of blocks. meanwhile, a new linear loss was introduced to optimize the network. to evaluate the work and compare multiple sr works, a benchmark dataset bcsr was created, which forces a model training on wider and more critical regions. the results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both performance and efficiency, and the newly created dataset significantly improves the reconstruction quality of all compared models. moreover, image classification experiments demonstrate that the suggested network improves the performance of downstream tasks in medical diagnosis scenarios. the proposed network and dataset provide effective priors for the sr task of pathology images, which significantly improves the diagnosis of relevant medical staff. the source code and the dataset are available on https://github.com/moyangsensei/carn-pytorch.",AB_0263
"over the past few years, deep learning-based image registration methods have achieved remarkable perfor-mance in medical image analysis. however, many existing methods struggle to ensure accurate registration while preserving the desired diffeomorphic properties and inverse consistency of the final deformation field. to address the problem, this paper presents a novel symmetric pyramid network for medical image inverse consistent diffeomorphic registration. specifically, we first encode the multi-scale images to the feature pyramids via a shared-weights encoder network and then progressively conduct the feature-level diffeomorphic registration. the feature-level registration is implemented symmetrically to ensure inverse consistency. we independently carry out the forward and backward feature-level registration and average the estimated bidirectional velocity fields for more robust estimation. finally, we employ symmetric multi-scale similarity loss to train the network. experimental results on three public datasets, including mindboggle101, candi, and oai, show that our method significantly outperforms others, demonstrating that the proposed network can achieve accurate alignment and generate the deformation fields with expected properties. our code will be available at https://github.com/zhangliutong/spnet.",AB_0263
"a dna barcode is a short piece of standard dna sequence used for species determination and discrimination. representation of dna barcodes is essential for dna barcodes' applications in the transportation and recognition of biological materials. previously, we have compared different strategies for representing the dna barcodes. in the present study, we have developed a compression algorithm based on binary coding or huffman coding scheme, followed by converting the binary digits into base64 digits. the combination of this compression algorithm and the qr representation leads to the dynamic dna qr coding algorithm (ddqr). we tested the ddqr algorithm on simulated data and real dna barcode sequences from the commonly used plant and animal dna barcode markers: rbcl, matk, trnh-psba, its2, and coi. we compared the compression efficiency of ddqr and another state-of-the-art dna compression algorithm geco3 for sequences with various base compositions and lengths. we found that ddqr had a higher compression rate than geco3 for dna sequences shorter than 800 bp, which is the typical size range for dna barcodes. we also upgraded a web server (http://www.1kmpg.cn/ddqr) that provides three functions: retrieval of dna barcode sequences, encoding dna barcode sequences to ddqr codes, and decoding ddqr codes to dna barcode sequences. the ddqr algorithm and the web server will be invaluable to applying dna barcode technology in the food and traditional medicine industries.",AB_0263
"motivation: many studies have shown that idh mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion can serve as prognostic signatures of glioma. although these genetic variations affect the expression of one or more genes, the prognostic value of gene expression related to idh and 1p/19q status is still unclear. results: we constructed an ensemble gene pair signature for the risk evaluation and survival prediction of glioma based on the prior knowledge of the idh and 1p/19q status. first, we separately built two gene pair signatures idh-gps and 1p/19q-gps and elucidated that they were useful transcriptome markers projecting from corresponding genome variations. then, the gene pairs in these two models were assembled to develop an integrated model named glioma prognostic gene pair signature (gpgps), which demonstrated high area under the curves (aucs) to predict 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival (0.92, 0.88 and 0.80) of glioma. gpgps was superior to the single gpss and other existing prognostic signatures (avg auc=0.70, concordance index=0.74). in conclusion, the ensemble prognostic signature with 10 gene pairs could serve as an independent predictor for risk stratification and survival prediction in glioma. this study shed light on transferring knowledge from genetic alterations to expression changes to facilitate prognostic studies. availability and implementation: codes are available at https://github.com/kimxbzheng/gpgps.git contact: easonlcheng@gmail.com or gengqingshan@szhospital.com supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0263
"accurately predicting the interaction modes for metalloproteins remains extremely challenging in structure-based drug design and mechanism analysis of enzymatic catalysis due to the complexity of metal coordination in metalloproteins. here, we report a docking method for metalloproteins based on geometric probability (gpdock) with unprecedented accuracy. the docking tests of 10 common metal ions with 9360 metalloprotein-ligand complexes demonstrate that gpdock has an accuracy of 94.3% in predicting binding pose. what is more, it can accurately realize the docking of metalloproteins with ligand when one or two water molecules are engaged in the metal ion coordination. since gpdock only depends on the three-dimensional structure of metalloprotein and ligand, structure based machine learning model is employed for the scoring of binding poses, which significantly improves computational efficiency. the proposed docking strategy can be an effective and efficient tool for drug design and further study of binding mechanism of metalloproteins. the manual of gpdock and the code for the logistical regression model used to re-rank the docking results are available at https://github.com/wangkai-zhku/gpdock.git.",AB_0263
"multi-view clustering (mvc) enhances the clustering performance of data by combining correlation information from different views. however, most existing mvc approaches process each sample independently and ignore the correlation amongst samples, resulting in reduced clustering performance. although graph convolution network (gcn) can naturally capture correlation amongst samples by integrating the neighbors and structural information into representation learning, it is used in the semi-supervised learning scenario. in this paper, we propose a neighbor-aware deep mvc framework based on gcn (nmvc-gcn) for clustering multi-view samples and training gcn in a fully unsupervised manner. in addition, we design a consensus regularization to learn the common representations and introduce a clustering embedding layer to jointly optimize the clustering task and representation learning, so that the correlation amongst samples and that between the clustering task and representation learning can be fully explored. extensive experiments on 10 datasets illustrate that nmvc-gcn significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art mvc methods. our code will be released at https://github.com/dugzzuli/nmvc-gcn.",AB_0263
"the proliferation of single-cell multimodal sequencing technologies has enabled us to understand cellular heterogeneity with multiple views, providing novel and actionable biological insights into the disease-driving mechanisms. here, we propose a comprehensive end-to-end single-cell multimodal analysis framework named deep parametric inference (dpi). dpi transforms single-cell multimodal data into a multimodal parameter space by inferring individual modal parameters. analysis of cord blood mononuclear cells (cbmc) reveals that the multimodal parameter space can characterize the heterogeneity of cells more comprehensively than individual modalities. furthermore, comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets show that dpi has superior performance. additionally, dpi can reference and query cell types without batch effects. as a result, dpi can successfully analyze the progression of covid-19 disease in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). notably, we further propose a cell state vector field and analyze the transformation pattern of bone marrow cells (bmc) states. in conclusion, dpi is a powerful single-cell multimodal analysis framework that can provide new biological insights into biomedical researchers. the python packages, datasets and user-friendly manuals of dpi are freely available at https://github.com/studentiz/dpi.",AB_0263
"newborn ruminants are considered functionally monogastric animals. the poor understanding of cellular differences between newborn and mature ruminants prevents the improvement of health and performance of domestic ruminants. here, we performed the single-cell rna sequencing on the rumen, reticulum, omasum, abomasum, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, rectum, liver, salivary gland, and mammary gland from newborn and adult cattle. a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas covering 235,941 high-quality single cells and 78 cell types was deciphered. a cattle cell landscape database (http:// cattlecelllandscape.zju.edu.cn) was established to elaborately display the data and facilitate effective annotation of cattle cell types and subtypes for the broad research community. by measuring stemness states of epithelial cells in each tissue type, we revealed that the epithelial cells from newborn forestomach (rumen, reticulum, and omasum) were more transcriptionally indistinct and stochastic compared with the adult stage, which was in contrast to those of abomasum and intestinal tissues. the rapid forestomach development during the early life of calves was driven by epithelial progenitor-like cells with high dna repair activities and methylation. moreover, in the forestomach tissues of newborn calves, the megasphaera genus was involved in regulating the transcriptional plasticity of the epithelial progenitor-like cells by dna methylation regulation. a novel cell type, the stoml3+ cell, was found to be newborn-specific. it apparently plays a crucial role in stemness maintenance of its own and cholangiocytes in the hepatic microenvironment. our results reveal that the age- and microbiota-dependent cell stemness plasticity drives the postnatal functional maturity of ruminants.",AB_0263
"proteins encoded by small open reading frames (sorfs) can serve as functional elements playing important roles in vivo. such sorfs also constitute the potential pool for facilitating the de novo gene birth, driving evolutionary innovation and species diversity. therefore, their theoretical and experimental identification has become a critical issue. herein, we proposed a protein-coding sorfs prediction method merely based on integrative sequence-derived features. our prediction performance is better or comparable compared with other nine prevalent methods, which shows that our method can provide a relatively reliable research tool for the prediction of protein-coding sorfs. our method allows users to estimate the potential expression of a queried sorf, which has been demonstrated by the correlation analysis between our possibility estimation and codon adaption index (cai). based on the features that we used, we demonstrated that the sequence features of the protein-coding sorfs in the two domains have significant differences implying that it might be a relatively hard task in terms of cross-domain prediction, hence domain-specific models were developed, which allowed users to predict protein-coding sorfs both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. finally, a web-server was developed and provided to boost and facilitate the study of the related field, which is freely available at http://guolab.whu.edu.cn/coding capacity/index.html.",AB_0263
