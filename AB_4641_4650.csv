"pre-trained language models have been successful in many knowledge-intensive nlp tasks. however, recent work has shown that models such as bert are not structurally readyto aggregate textual information into a [cls] vector for dense passage retrieval (dpr). this lack of readinessresults from the gap between language model pre-training and dpr fine-tuning. previous solutions call for computationally expensive techniques such as hard negative mining, cross-encoder distillation, and further pre-training to learn a robust dpr model. in this work, we instead propose to fully exploit knowledge in a pre trained language model for dpr by aggregating the contextualized token embeddings into a dense vector, which we call agg*. by concatenating vectors from the [cls] token and agg*, our aggretriever model substantially improves the effectiveness of dense retrieval models on both in-domain and zero-shot evaluations without introducing substantial training overhead. code is available at https:// github.com/castorini/dhr.",AB_0465
"phastest (phage search tool with enhanced sequence translation) is the successor to the phast and phaster prophage finding web servers. phastest is designed to support the rapid identification, annotation and visualization of prophage sequences within bacterial genomes and plasmids. phastest also supports rapid annotation and interactive visualization of all other genes (protein coding regions, trna/tmrna/rrna sequences) in bacterial genomes. given that bacterial genome sequencing has become so routine, the need for fast tools to comprehensively annotate bacterial genomes has become progressively more important. phastest not only offers faster and more accurate prophage annotations than its predecessors, it also provides more complete whole genome annotations andmuch improved genome visualization capabilities. in standardized tests, we found that phastest is 31% faster and 2-3% more accurate in prophage identification than phaster. specifically, phastest can process a typical bacterial genome in 3.2 min (raw sequence) or in 1.3 min when given a pre-annotated genbank file. improvements in phastest's ability to annotate bacterial genomes now make it a particularly powerful tool for whole genome annotation. in addition, phastest now offers a much more modern and responsive visualization interface that allows users to generate, edit, annotate and interactively visualize (via zooming, rotating, dragging, panning, resetting), colourful, publication quality genomemaps. phastest continues to offer popular options such as an api for programmatic queries, a docker image for local installations, support for multiple (metagenomic) queries and the ability to perform automated look-ups against thousands of previously phastannotated bacterial genomes. phastest is available online at https://phastest.ca.

"background major depressive disorder (mdd) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and is commonly treated with antidepressant drugs (ad). although effective, many patients fail to respond to ad treatment, and accordingly identifying factors that can predict ad response would greatly improve treatment outcomes. in this study, we developed a machine learning tool to integrate multi-omic datasets (gene expression, dna methylation, and genotyping) to identify biomarker profiles associated with ad response in a cohort of individuals with mdd. materials and methods individuals with mdd (n = 111) were treated for 8 weeks with antidepressants and were separated into responders and non-responders based on the montgomery-asberg depression rating scale (madrs). using peripheral blood samples, we performed rna-sequencing, assessed dna methylation using the illumina epic array, and performed genotyping using the illumina psycharray. to address this rich multi-omic dataset with high dimensional features, we developed integrative geneset-embedded non-negative matrix factorization (igem), a non-negative matrix factorization (nmf) based model, supplemented with auxiliary information regarding gene sets and gene-methylation relationships. in particular, we factorize the subjects by features (i.e., gene expression or dna methylation) into subjects-by-factors and factors-by-features. we define the factors as the meta-phenotypes as they represent integrated composite scores of the molecular measurements for each subject. results using our model, we identified a number of meta-phenotypes which were related to ad response. by integrating geneset information into the model, we were able to relate these meta-phenotypes to biological processes, including a meta-phenotype related to immune and inflammatory functions as well as other genes related to depression or ad response. the meta-phenotype identified several genes including immune interleukin 1 receptor like 1 (il1rl1) and interleukin 5 receptor (il5) subunit alpha (il5ra), akt/pik3 pathway related phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 6 (pik3r6), and sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (smpd3), which has been identified as a target of ad treatment. conclusions the derived meta-phenotypes and associated biological functions represent both biomarkers to predict response, as well as potential new treatment targets. our method is applicable to other diseases with multi-omic data, and the software is open source and available on github (https://github.com/li-lab-mcgill/igem).",AB_0465
"thecomparison of protein conformational ensembles is of centralimportance in structural biology. however, there are few computationalmethods for ensemble comparison, and those that are readily available,such as encore, utilize methods that are sufficiently computationallyexpensive to be prohibitive for large ensembles. here, a new methodis presented for efficient representation and comparison of proteinconformational ensembles. the method is based on the representationof a protein ensemble as a vector of probability distribution functions(pdfs), with each pdf representing the distribution of a local structuralproperty such as the number of contacts between c-& beta; atoms. dissimilarity between two conformational ensembles is quantifiedby the jensen-shannon distance between the corresponding setof probability distribution functions. the method is validated forconformational ensembles generated by molecular dynamics simulationsof ubiquitin, as well as experimentally derived conformational ensemblesof a 130 amino acid truncated form of human tau protein. in the ubiquitinensemble data set, the method was up to 88 times faster than the existingencore software, while simultaneously utilizing 48 times fewer computingcores. we make the method available as a python package, called prothon,and provide a github page with the python source code at https://github.com/plotkinlab/prothon.",AB_0465
"hibridon is a program package to solve the close-coupled equations which occur in the time independent quantum treatment of inelastic atomic and molecular collisions. gas-phase scattering, photodissociation, collisions of atoms and/or molecules with flat surfaces, and bound states of weakly-bound complexes can be treated. from calculation of the s matrix, integral and differential cross sections, stereodynamic (alignment and steric asymmetry) cross sections, as well as more specialized quantities, such as transport and tensor cross sections, and cross sections between hyperfine levels, and photodissociation amplitudes can be obtained. the program is capable of treating closed-shell systems where the nuclear motion takes place on a single born-oppenheimer potential as well as open-shell systems for which the nuclear motion can evolve on several coupled electronic (born-oppenheimer) potentials. program summary program title: hibridon cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /sk9zcvz8vs .1 developer's repository link: https://doi .org /10 .5281 /zenodo .7551616 licensing provisions: gplv3 programming language: fortran 90 external routines/libraries: lapack, blas nature of problem: solution of the time-independent schr0dinger equation for the inelastic scattering of atoms and molecules, for the photodissociation of molecules, and for the ro-vibrational motion of weakly bound molecular complexes. solution method: the scattering wavefunction is expanded in a set of internal states of the system, constructed as direct products of the internal states of one (or both) fragments and angular functions which describe the rotation of one collision partner about the other. the schr0dinger equation for the nuclear motion is solved by determining the expansion coefficients as a function of the interparticle separation starting from the short-range classically forbidden region outwards to the asymptotic region. the s matrix is given by the asymptotic behavior of the wavefunction. integral and differential cross sections, as well as other scattering and photodissociation quantities are calculated from the s matrix.

"background: psychomotor disturbance is common in psychotic depression and is associated with relapse. in this analysis, we examined whether white matter microstructure is associated with relapse probability in psychotic depression and, if so, whether white matter microstructure accounts for the association between psychomotor disturbance and relapse.methods: we used tractography to characterize diffusion-weighted mri data in 80 participants enrolled in a randomized clinical trial that compared efficacy and tolerability of sertraline plus olanzapine with sertraline plus placebo in the continuation treatment of remitted psychotic depression. cox proportional hazard models tested the relationships between psychomotor disturbance (processing speed and core score) at baseline, white matter microstructure (fractional anisotropy [fa] and mean diffusivity [md]) in 15 selected tracts at baseline, and relapse probability.results: core was significantly associated with relapse. higher mean md was significantly associated with relapse in the each of the following tracts: corpus callosum, left striato-frontal, left thalamo-frontal, and right thalamo-frontal. core and md were each associated with relapse in the final models.limitations: as a secondary analysis with a small sample size, this study was not powered for its aims, and is vulnerable to types i and ii statistical errors. further, the sample size was not sufficient to test the interaction of the independent variables and randomized treatment group with relapse probability.conclusions: while both psychomotor disturbance and md were associated with psychotic depression relapse, md did not account for the relationship between psychomotor disturbance and relapse. the mechanism by which of psychomotor disturbance increases the risk of relapse requires further investigation.clinical trial registration: study of the pharmacotherapy of psychotic depression ii (stop-pd ii); nct01427608. url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct01427608.",AB_0465
"minipromoters, or compact promoters, are short-dna sequences that can drive expression in specific cells and tissues. while broadly useful, they are of high relevance to gene therapy due to their role in enabling precise control of where a therapeutic gene will be expressed. here, we present ontarget (http://ontarget.cmmt.ubc.ca), a webserver that streamlines the minipromoter design process. users only need to specify a gene of interest or custom genomic coordinates on which to focus the identification of promoters and enhancers, and can also provide relevant cell-type-specific genomic evidence (e.g. accessible chromatin regions, histone modifications, etc.). ontarget combines the provided data with internal data to identify candidate promoters and enhancers and design minipromoters. to illustrate the utility of ontarget, we designed and characterized two minipromoters targeting different cell populations relevant to parkinson disease.

"background: magnetoencephalography (meg) is a widely used non-invasive tool to estimate brain activity with high temporal resolution. however, due to the ill-posed nature of the meg source imaging (msi) problem, the ability of msi to identify accurately underlying brain sources along the cortical surface is still uncertain and requires validation.method: we validated the ability of msi to estimate the background resting state activity of 45 healthy participants by comparing it to the intracranial eeg (ieeg) atlas ( https://mni-open-ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca/ ). first, we applied wavelet-based maximum entropy on the mean (wmem) as an msi technique. next, we converted meg source maps into intracranial space by applying a forward model to the meg-reconstructed source maps, and estimated virtual ieeg (vieeg) potentials on each ieeg channel location; we finally quantitatively compared those with actual ieeg signals from the atlas for 38 regions of interest in the canonical frequency bands.results: the meg spectra were more accurately estimated in the lateral regions compared to the medial regions. the regions with higher amplitude in the vieeg than in the ieeg were more accurately recovered. in the deep regions, meg-estimated amplitudes were largely underestimated and the spectra were poorly recovered. over-all, our wmem results were similar to those obtained with minimum norm or beamformer source localization. moreover, the meg largely overestimated oscillatory peaks in the alpha band, especially in the anterior and deep regions. this is possibly due to higher phase synchronization of alpha oscillations over extended regions, exceed-ing the spatial sensitivity of ieeg but detected by meg. importantly, we found that meg-estimated spectra were more comparable to spectra from the ieeg atlas after the aperiodic components were removed.conclusion: this study identifies brain regions and frequencies for which meg source analysis is likely to be reliable, a promising step towards resolving the uncertainty in recovering intracerebral activity from non-invasive meg studies.",AB_0465

"recent advances have shown that some biologically active non-coding rnas (ncrnas) are actually translated into polypeptides that have a physiological function as well. this paradigm shift requires adapted computational methods to predict this new class of 'bifunctional rnas'. previously, we developed irsom, an open-source algorithm to classify non-coding and coding rnas. here, we use the binary statistical model of irsom as a ternary classifier, called irsom2, to identify bifunctional rnas as a rejection of the two other classes. we present its easy-to-use web interface, which allows users to perform predictions on large datasets of rna sequences in a short time, to re-train the model with their own data, and to visualize and analyze the classification results thanks to the implementation of self-organizing maps (som). we also propose a new benchmark of experimentally validated rnas that play both protein-coding and non-coding roles, in different organisms. thus, irsom2 showed promising performance in detecting these bifunctional transcripts among ncrnas of different types, such as circrnas and lncrnas (in particular those of shorter lengths). the web server is freely available on the evryrna platform: https://evryrna.ibisc.univ-evry.fr.
