"molecular recognition features (morfs) are a commonly occurring type of intrinsically disordered regions (idrs) that undergo disorder-to-order transition upon binding to partner molecules. we focus on recently characterized and functionally important membrane-binding morfs (memmorfs). motivated by the lack of computational tools that predict memmorfs, we use a dataset of experimentally annotated mem-morfs to conceptualize, design, evaluate and release an accurate sequence-based predictor. we rely on state-of-the-art tools that predict residues that possess key characteristics of memmorfs, such as intrinsic disorder, disorder-to-order transition and lipid-binding. we identify and combine results from three tools that include fldpnn for the disorder prediction, disolippred for the prediction of disordered lipid-binding regions, and morfchibilight for the prediction of disorder-to-order transitioning protein binding regions. our empirical analysis demonstrates that combining results produced by these three methods generates accurate predictions of memmorfs. we also show that use of a smoothing operator produces predictions that closely mimic the number and sizes of the native memmorf regions. the resulting comemmorfpred method is available as an easy-to-use webserver at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/ser-vers/comemmorfpred. this tool will aid future studies of memmorfs in the context of exploring their abundance, cellular functions, and roles in pathologic phenomena.

"background: tyrosinase is an enzyme involved in melanin production in the skin. several hyperpigmentation disorders involve the overproduction of melanin and instability of tyrosinase activity resulting in darker, discolored patches on the skin. therefore, discovering tyrosinase inhibitory peptides (tips) is of great significance for basic research and clinical treatments. however, the identification of tips using experimental methods is generally cost-ineffective and time-consuming. results: herein, a stacked ensemble learning approach, called tipred, is proposed for the accurate and quick identification of tips by using sequence information. tipred explored a comprehensive set of various baseline models derived from well-known machine learning (ml) algorithms and heterogeneous feature encoding schemes from multiple perspectives, such as chemical structure properties, physicochemical properties, and composition information. subsequently, 130 baseline models were trained and optimized to create new probabilistic features. finally, the feature selection approach was utilized to determine the optimal feature vector for developing tipred. both tenfold cross-validation and independent test methods were employed to assess the predictive capability of tipred by using the stacking strategy. experimental results showed that tipred significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art method in terms of the independent test, with an accuracy of 0.923, mcc of 0.757 and an auc of 0.977. conclusions: the proposed tipred approach could be a valuable tool for rapidly discovering novel tips and effectively identifying potential tip candidates for follow-up experimental validation. moreover, an online webserver of tipred is publicly available at http://pmlabstack.pythonanywhere.com/tipred.",AB_0558
"modern industrial facilities generate large volumes of raw sensor data during the production process. this data is used to monitor and control the processes and can be analyzed to detect and predict process abnormalities. typically, the data has to be annotated by experts in order to be used in predictive modeling. however, manual annotation of large amounts of data can be difficult in industrial settings.in this paper, we propose sensorscan, a novel method for unsupervised fault detection and diagnosis, designed for industrial chemical process monitoring. we demonstrate our model's performance on two publicly available datasets of the tennessee eastman process with various faults. the results show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches (+0.2-0.3 tpr for a fixed fpr) and effectively detects most of the process faults without expert annotation. moreover, we show that the model fine-tuned on a small fraction of labeled data nearly reaches the performance of a sota model trained on the full dataset. we also demonstrate that our method is suitable for real-world applications where the number of faults is not known in advance. the code is available at https:// github .com /airi -institute /sensorscan.(c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0558
"motivation comprehensive multi-omics studies have driven advances in disease modeling for effective precision medicine but pose a challenge for existing machine-learning approaches, which have limited interpretability across clinical endpoints. automated, comprehensive disease modeling requires a machine-learning approach that can simultaneously identify disease subgroups and their defining molecular biomarkers by explaining multiple clinical endpoints. current tools are restricted to individual endpoints or limited variable types, necessitate advanced computation skills, and require resource-intensive manual expert interpretation.results we developed multi-target automated tree engine (mutate) for automated and comprehensive molecular modeling, which enables user-friendly multi-objective decision tree construction and visualization of relationships between molecular biomarkers and patient subgroups characterized by multiple clinical endpoints. mutate incorporates multiple targets throughout model construction and allows for target weights, enabling construction of interpretable decision trees that provide insights into disease heterogeneity and molecular signatures. mutate eliminates the need for manual synthesis of multiple non-explainable models, making it highly efficient and accessible for bioinformaticians and clinicians. the flexibility and versatility of mutate make it applicable to a wide range of complex diseases, including cancer, where it can improve therapeutic decisions by providing comprehensive molecular insights for precision medicine. mutate has the potential to transform biomarker discovery and subtype identification, leading to more effective and personalized treatment strategies in precision medicine, and advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms at the molecular level.availability and implementation mutate is freely available at github (https://github.com/sarahayton/mutate) under the gplv3 license.",AB_0558
"environmental noise and data sparsity present major challenges within the field of bioacoustics. the presence of noise degrades the analysis of audio and field recordings commonly containing large quantities of data with sparse vocalisation features. this work explores noise reduction (audio enhancement) techniques in the context of extremely sparse vocalisations (< 1% occurrence rates) of invasive mammalian and marsupial species, and the clear implications for other bioacoustics applications which face similar challenges. this work compares relevant noise reduction techniques and recommends a spectral subtraction approach. spectral subtraction achieved a 42.1 db improvement in signal to noise power (snnr) and a 2.7 db improvement in noise variance (sr). we also demonstrate reliable noise reduction at bandwidths up to 250 khz and efficiency improvements compared to alternative methods. we explore the benefits of deep audio enhancement approaches demonstrating comparable noise reduction with improvements in transient noise reduction but also key limitations such as bandwidth, efficiency and data generation in bioacoustics applications. we identify how the contributions of this work can be applied within the broader context of bioacoustics. all data and code is publicly available at https://github. com/benmcewen1/sparse-noise-reduction",AB_0558
"simulation of wave propagation in poroelastic half-spaces presents a common challenge in fields like geomechanics and biomechanics, requiring absorbing boundary conditions (abcs) at the semi-infinite space boundaries. perfectly matched layers (pml) are a popular choice due to their excellent wave absorption properties. however, pml implementation can lead to problems with unknown stresses or strains, time convolutions, or pde systems with auxiliary differential equations (ades), which increases computational complexity and resource consumption.this article introduces a novel hybrid pml formulation for arbitrary poroelastic domains. instead of using ades, this formulation utilizes time-history variables to reduce the number of unknowns and mathematical operations. the modification of the pdes to account for the pml is limited to the pml domain only, resulting in smaller matrices while maintaining the governing equations in the interior domain and preserving the temporal structure of the problem. the hybrid approach introduces three scalar variables localized within the pml domain.the proposed formulation was tested in three numerical experiments in geophysics using realistic parameters for soft sites with free surfaces. the results were compared with numerical solutions from extended domains and simpler abcs, such as paraxial approximation, demonstrating the accuracy, efficiency, and precision of the proposed method. the article also discusses the applicability of the method to complex media and its extension to the multiaxial pml formulation.the codes used for the simulations are available for download from https://github.com/hmella/porous-hybrid-pml.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0558
"motivation: the process of drug discovery is notoriously complex, costing an average of 2.6 billion dollars and taking similar to 13 years to bring a new drug to the market. the success rate for new drugs is alarmingly low (around 0.0001%), and severe adverse drug reactions (adrs) frequently occur, some of which may even result in death. early identification of potential adrs is critical to improve the efficiency and safety of the drug development process. results: in this study, we employed pretrained large language models (llms) to predict the likelihood of a drug being withdrawn from the market due to safety concerns. our method achieved an area under the curve (auc) of over 0.75 through cross-database validation, outperforming classical machine learning models and graph-based models. notably, our pretrained llms successfully identified over 50% drugs that were subsequently withdrawn, when predictions were made on a subset of drugs with inconsistent labeling between the training and test sets. availability and implementation: the code and datasets are available at https://github.com/eyalmazuz/drugwithdrawn.",AB_0558
"hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection is a concerning health issue that causes chronic liver diseases. despite many successful therapeutic outcomes, no effective hcv vaccines are currently available. focusing on t cell activity, the primary effector for hcv clearance, t cell epitopes of hcv (tce-hcv) are considered promising elements to accelerate hcv vaccine efficacy. thus, accurate and rapid identification of tce-hcvs is recommended to obtain more efficient therapy for chronic hcv infection. in this study, a novel sequence-based stacked approach, termed trollope, is proposed to accurately identify tce-hcvs from sequence information. specifically, we employed 12 different sequence-based feature descriptors from heterogeneous perspectives, such as physicochemical properties, composition-transition-distribution information and composition information. these descriptors were used in cooperation with 12 popular machine learning (ml) algorithms to create 144 base-classifiers. to maximize the utility of these base-classifiers, we used a feature selection strategy to determine a collection of potential base-classifiers and integrated them to develop the meta-classifier. comprehensive experiments based on both cross-validation and independent tests demonstrated the superior predictive performance of trollope compared with conventional ml classifiers, with cross-validation and independent test accuracies of 0.745 and 0.747, respectively. finally, a user-friendly online web server of trollope (http://pmlabqsar.pythonanywhere.com/trollope) has been developed to serve research efforts in the large-scale identification of potential tce-hcvs for follow-up experimental verification.",AB_0558
"motivation: next generation sequencing technologies make it possible to detect rare genetic variants in individual patients. currently, more than a dozen software and web services have been created to predict the pathogenicity of variants related with changing of amino acid residues. despite considerable efforts in this area, at the moment there is no ideal method to classify pathogenic and harmless variants, and the assessment of the pathogenicity is often contradictory. in this article, we propose to use peptides structural formulas of proteins as an amino acid residues substitutions description, rather than a single-letter code. this allowed us to investigate the effectiveness of chemoinformatics approach to assess the pathogenicity of variants associated with amino acid substitutions. results: the structure-activity relationships analysis relying on protein-specific data and atom centric substructural multilevel neighborhoods of atoms (mna) descriptors of molecular fragments appeared to be suitable for predicting the pathogenic effect of single amino acid variants. mna-based nai<spacing diaeresis>ve bayes classifier algorithm, clinvar and humsavar data were used for the creation of structure-activity relationships models for 10 proteins. the performance of the models was compared with 11 different predicting tools: 8 individual (sift 4g, polyphen2 hdiv, mutationassessor, provean, fathmm, mvp, list-s2, mutpred) and 3 consensus (m-cap, metasvm, metalr). the accuracy of mna-based method varies for the proteins (auc: 0.631-0.993; mcc: 0.191-0.891). it was similar for both the results of comparisons with the other individual predictors and third-party protein-specific predictors. for several proteins (brca1, brca2, col1a2, and ryr1), the performance of the mna-based method was outstanding, capable of capturing the pathogenic effect of structural changes in amino acid substitutions. availability and implementation: the datasets are available as supplemental data at bioinformatics online. a python script to convert amino acid and nucleotide sequences from single-letter codes to sd files is available at https://github.com/smirnygatotoshka/sequencetosdf. the authors provide trial licenses for multipass software to interested readers upon request.",AB_0558
