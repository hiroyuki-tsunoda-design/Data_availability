"alternative splicing (as) is a dynamic rna processing step that produces multiple rna isoforms from a single pre-mrna transcript and contributes to the complexity of the cellular transcriptome and proteome. this process is regulated through a network of cis -regulatory sequence elements and trans -acting factors, most-notably rna binding proteins (rbps). the muscleblind-like (mbnl) and rna binding fox-1 homolog (rbfox) are two well characterized families of rbps that regulate fetal to adult as transitions critical for proper muscle, heart, and central nervous system development. to better understand how the concentra-tion of these rbps influences as transcriptome wide, we engineered a mbnl1 and rbfox1 inducible hek-293 cell line. modest induction of exogenous rbfox1 in this cell line modulated mbnl1-dependent as outcomes in 3 skipped exon events, despite significant levels of endogenous rbfox1 and rbfox2. due to background rbfox levels, we conducted a focused analysis of dose-dependent mbnl1 skipped exon as outcomes and generated transcriptome wide dose-response curves. analysis of this data demonstrates that mbnl1-regulated exclusion events may require higher concentrations of mbnl1 protein to properly regulate as outcomes compared to inclusion events and that multiple arrange-ments of ygcy motifs can produce similar splicing outcomes. these results suggest that rather than a simple relationship between the organization of rbp binding sites and a specific splicing outcome, that complex interaction networks govern both as inclusion and exclusion events across a rbp gradient.

"the striatum integrates dense neuromodulatory inputs from many brain regions to coordinate complex behaviors. this integration relies on the coordinated responses from distinct striatal cell types. while previous studies have characterized the cellular and molecular composition of the striatum using single-cell rna-sequencing at distinct developmental timepoints, the molecular changes spanning embryonic through postnatal development at the single-cell level have not been examined. here, we combine published mouse striatal single-cell datasets from both embryonic and postnatal timepoints to analyze the developmental trajectory patterns and transcription factor regulatory networks within striatal cell types. using this integrated dataset, we found that dopamine receptor-1 expressing spiny projection neurons have an extended period of transcriptional dynamics and greater transcriptional complexity over postnatal development compared to dopamine receptor-2 expressing neurons. moreover, we found the transcription factor, foxp1, exerts indirect changes to oligodendrocytes. these data can be accessed and further analyzed through an interactive website (https:// mouse-stria tal- dev. cells. ucsc. edu).",AB_0610
"objective the goal of this work was to methodically evaluate, optimize, and validate a self-supervised machine learning algorithm capable of real-time automatic registration and fluoroscopic localization of the spine using a single radiograph or fluoroscopic frame. methods the authors propose a two-dimensional to three-dimensional (2d-3d) registration algorithm that maximizes an image similarity metric between radiographic images to identify the position of a c- arm relative to a 3d volume. this work utilizes digitally reconstructed radiographs (drrs), which are synthetic radiographic images generated by simulating the x-ray projections as they would pass through a ct volume. to evaluate the algorithm, the authors used cone-beam ct data for 127 patients obtained from an open-source de-identified registry of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar scans. they systematically evaluated and tuned the algorithm, then quantified the convergence rate of the model by simulating c-arm registrations with 80 randomly simulated drrs for each ct volume. the endpoints of this study were time to convergence, accuracy of convergence for each of the c-arm's degrees of freedom, and overall registration accuracy based on a voxel-by-voxel measurement. results a total of 10,160 unique radiographic images were simulated from 127 ct scans. the algorithm successfully converged to the correct solution 82% of the time with an average of 1.96 seconds of computation. the radiographic images for which the algorithm converged to the solution demonstrated 99.9% registration accuracy despite utilizing only single-precision computation for speed. the algorithm was found to be optimized for convergence when the search space was limited to a +/- 45 degrees offset in the right anterior oblique/ left anterior oblique, cranial/caudal, and receiver rotation angles with the radiographic isocenter contained within 8000 cm3 of the volumetric center of the ct volume. conclusions the investigated machine learning algorithm has the potential to aid surgeons in level localization, surgical planning, and intraoperative navigation through a completely automated 2d-3d registration process. future work will focus on algorithmic optimizations to improve the convergence rate and speed profile. https:// thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2023.3. focus2345",AB_0610
"we present an updated version of lightning, a galaxy spectral energy distribution (sed) fitting code that can model x-ray to submillimeter observations. the models in lightning include the options to contain contributions from stellar populations, dust attenuation and emission, and active galactic nuclei (agns). x-ray emission, when utilized, can be modeled as originating from stellar compact binary populations with the option to include emission from agns. we have also included a variety of algorithms to fit the models to observations and sample parameter posteriors; these include adaptive markov chain monte carlo (mcmc), affine-invariant mcmc, and levenberg-marquardt gradient-descent (mpfit) algorithms. to demonstrate some of the capabilities of lightning, we present several examples using a variety of observational data. these examples include (1) deriving the spatially resolved stellar properties of the nearby galaxy m81, (2) demonstrating how x-ray emission can provide constraints on the properties of the supermassive black hole of a distant agn, (3) exploring how to rectify the attenuation effects of inclination on the derived the star formation rate of the edge-on galaxy ngc 4631, (4) comparing the performance of lightning to similar bayesian sed-fitting codes when deriving physical properties of the star-forming galaxy ngc 628, and (5) comparing the derived x-ray and uv-to-ir agn properties from lightning and cigale for a distant agn. lightning is an open-source application developed in idl and is available at https://github.com/rafaeleufrasio/lightning.",AB_0610
"study objectives: pharmacotherapy for obstructive sleep apnea (osa) regained consideration after the discovery that atomoxetine and oxybutynin greatly reduced osa severity. however, atomoxetine and oxybutynin reduced the arousal threshold and may therefore be poorly tolerated in patients with osa and disturbed sleep. as a result, we tested the combination of atomoxetine plus 2 hypnotics in patients with osa. the effects of atomoxetine plus: (1) trazodone (ato-trazo) and (2) lemborexant vs placebo on apnea-hypopnea index, hypoxic burden, arousal threshold, and total sleep time were assessed. drug safety was also ascertained, together with the effect of the combinations on other osa traits, self-reported sleep quality, and next-day alertness.methods: following a baseline study, 15 patients with mild-to-severe osa with moderate upper airway collapsibility were administered ato-trazo, atomoxetine and lemborexant, and matching placebo according to a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. apnea-hypopnea index and other objective outcomes were calculated from 3 clinical, in-laboratory polysomnograms.results: ato-trazo significantly reduced apnea-hypopnea index from a median [interquartile range] of 18.2 [11.8 to 31.3] on placebo to 7.4 [5.4 to 16.1] events/h, p = .024, and hypoxic burden from 46.3 [25.1 to 88.3] on placebo to 18.7 [14.9 to 43.5], p = .003. this effect was likely driven by an increase in polysomnographyestimated pharyngeal muscle activity during the events (p = .029). atomoxetine and lemborexant had smaller statistically insignificant effects. contrary to atomoxetine and oxybutynin, ato-trazo and atomoxetine and lemborexant did not reduce the arousal threshold. both combinations had no effect on total sleep time but worsened self-reported sleep quality.conclusions: ato-trazo has the potential to become a useful drug combination, however, longer trials are needed to determine the best dosage and the subgroup of patients who may benefit most from this combination. clinical trial registration: registry: clinicaltrials.gov; name: crossover trial of ad182 and ad504 in obstructive sleep apnea; url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ct2/show/nct04645524; identifier: nct04645524.",AB_0610
"antibodies are generated by b cells that evolve receptor specificity to pathogens through rounds of mutation and selection in a process called affinity maturation. somatic hypermutation is mediated by an enzyme with dna sequence context-dependent targeting and substitution resulting in variable probabilities of amino acid substitutions during affinity maturation. we have previously developed a program called antigen receptor mutation analyzer for the detection of low likelihood occurrences (armadillo) that performs simulations of the somatic hypermutation process to estimate the probabilities of observed antibody mutations. here we describe the armadillo web server (https://armadillo.dhvi.duke.edu), an easy-to-use web interface that analyzes input antibody sequences and displays the probability estimates for all possible amino acid changes over the full length of an antibody sequence. the probability of antibody mutations can be used by immunologists studying b cell ontogenies and by vaccine designers that are pursuing strategies to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies which are enriched with developmentally rate-limiting improbable mutations. the armadillo web server also contains precomputed results reporting the probability of amino acid substitutions in all human v gene segments and in a collection of hiv broadly neutralizing antibodies.",AB_0610
"the idea of robustness is central and critical to modern statistical analymany studies have shown that dnns are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. making imperceptible changes to an image can cause dnn models to make the wrong classification with high confidence, such as classifying a benign mole as a malignant tumor and a stop sign as a speed limit sign. the tradeoff between robustness and standard accuracy is common for dnn models. in this paper we introduce sensible adversarial learning and demonstrate the synergistic effect between pursuits of standard natural accuracy and robustness. specifically, we define a sensible adversary, which is useful for learning a robust model, while keeping high natural accuracy. we theoretically establish that the bayes classifier is the most robust multiclass classifier with the 0 - 1 loss under sensible adversarial learning. we propose a novel and efficient algorithm that trains a robust model using implicit loss truncation. we apply sensible adversarial learning for large-scale image classification to a handwritten digital image dataset, called mnist, and an object recognition colored image dataset, called cifar10. we have performed an extensive comparative study to compare our method with other competitive methods. our experiments empirically demonstrate that our method is not sensitive to its hyperparameter and does not collapse even with a small model capacity while promoting robustness against various attacks and keeping high natural accuracy. the sensible adversarial learning software is available as a python package at https://github.com/jungeumkim/sense.",AB_0610
"study objectives: several studies have shown that patients with short sleep duration show a poor response to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (cbt-i), but such studies have not included patients with comorbid conditions. the current study was conducted to determine whether pretreatment sleep duration moderates the response of patients with major depression and insomnia disorders to a combined cbt-i and antidepressant medication treatment.methods: this study comprised a secondary analysis of a larger randomized trial that tested combined cbt-i/antidepressant medication treatment of patients with major depression and insomnia. participants (n = 99; 70 women; mage = 47.712.4 years) completed pretreatment polysomnography and then were randomly assigned to a 12-week treatment with antidepressant medication combined with cbt-i or a sham therapy. short and longer sleepers were defined using total sleep time cutoffs of < 5, < 6, and < 7 hours for short sleep. insomnia and depression remission ascertained respectively from the insomnia severity index and hamilton rating scale for depression were used to compare treatment responses of short and longer sleepers defined by the cutoffs mentioned.results: logistic regression analyses showed that statistically significant results were obtained only when the cutoff of < 5 hours of sleep was used to define short sleep. both the cbt-i recipients with < 5 hours of sleep (odds ratio = 0.053; 95% confidence interval = 0.006-0.499) and the sham-therapy group with >_ 5 hours of sleep (odds ratio = 0.149; 95% confidence interval = 0.045-0.493) were significantly less likely to achieve insomnia remission than were cbt-i recipients with >_ 5 hours of sleep. the shorter sleeping cbt-i group (odds ratio = 0.118; 95% confidence interval = 0.020-0.714) and longer sleeping sham-therapy group (odds ratio = 0.321; 95% confidence interval = 0.105-0.983) were also less likely to achieve insomnia and/or depression remission than was the longer sleeping cbt-i group with >_ 5 hours of sleep.conclusions: sleeping < 5 hours may dispose comorbid major depression/insomnia patients to a poor response to combined cbt-i/medication treatments for their insomnia and depression. future studies to replicate these findings and explore mechanisms of treatment response seem warranted.clinical trial registration: registry: clinicaltrials.gov; name: treatment of insomnia and depression (triad); url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/ nct00767624; identifier: nct00767624.",AB_0610
"study objectives: cognitive impairment and insomnia are common in chronic heart failure (hf). we examined the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (cbt-i) and the extent to which demographic, clinical, symptom, and functional characteristics predicted cognition among people with chronic hf and insomnia who participated in a randomized controlled trial of cbt-i. methods: participants with hf were randomized to group-based cbt-i or an attention control (hf self-management education). outcomes were measured over 1 year. we measured psychomotor vigilance and self-reported cognitive ability (promis cognitive abilities scale), clinical and demographic characteristics, history of sleep apnea, fatigue, pain, insomnia (insomnia severity index), sleepiness (epworth sleepiness scale), six minute walk, euroqol quality of life, and wrist actigraphy (sleep characteristics and rest-activity rhythms). we used cosinor analysis to compute rest-activity rhythms and general linear models and general estimating equations to test the effects of predictors over 1 year. results: the sample included 175 participants (mean age = 63 sd = 12.9 years; 43% women). there was a statistically significant group-time effect on self-reported cognitive function and increases in the proportion of participants, with < 3 psychomotor vigilance lapses in the cbt-i group. controlling for group-time effects and baseline cognition, decreased sleepiness, improved rest-activity rhythms, and 6-minute walk distance predicted a composite measure of cognition (psychomotor vigilance lapses and self-reported cognition). conclusions: cbt-i may improve cognition in adults with chronic hf. a future fully powered randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm the extent to which cbt-i improves multiple dimensions of cognition. clinical trial registration: registry: clinicaltrials.gov; name: cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: a self-management strategy for chronic illness in heart failure; url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct02660385; identifier: nct02660385.",AB_0610
"objective woven endobridge (web) intrasaccular flow disruptors and stent-assisted coiling (sac) are viable en- dovascular treatment options for wide-neck bifurcation intracranial aneurysms (wnbas). data directly comparing these two treatment options are limited. the authors aimed to compare radiographic occlusion rates and complication profiles between patients who received web and those who received sac for wnbas.methods retrospective review of a prospectively maintained cerebrovascular procedural database was performed at a single academic medical center between 2017 and 2021. patients were included if they underwent web embolization or sac of an unruptured wnba. sac patients were propensity matched to web-embolized patients on the basis of an-eurysm morphology. complete and adequate (complete occlusion or residual neck remnant) occlusion rates at last angio-graphic follow-up, as well as periprocedural complications, were compared between the two groups. a cost comparison was performed for a typical 5-mm wnba treated with web versus sac by using manufacturer-suggested retail prices.results thirty-five web and 70 sac patients were included. aneurysm width, neck size, and dome-to-neck ratio were comparable between groups. follow-up duration was significantly longer in the sac group (median [interquartile range] 545 [202-834] days vs 228 [177-494] days, p < 0.001, mann-whitney u-test). complete (66% of web patients vs 69% of sac patients) and adequate (94% web vs 91% sac) occlusion rates were similar between groups at the last available angiographic follow-up (p = 0.744, chi-square test). complete occlusion rates were comparable on cox regression analysis after correction for follow-up duration (hazard ratio 1.5, 95% ci 0.8-3.1). average time to residual aneurysm or neck formation was not statistically different between treatment groups (613 days for sac patients vs 347 days for web patients, p = 0.225, log-rank test). periprocedural complications trended higher in the sac group (0% web vs 9% sac, p = 0.175, fisher exact test), although this finding was not significant. the equipment costs for a typical sac case were estimated at $18,950, whereas the costs for a typical web device case were estimated at $18,630.conclusions midterm complete and adequate occlusion rates were similar between patients treated with web and those treated with sac. given these comparable outcomes, there may be equipoise in treatment options for wnbas. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.10.jns221138",AB_0610
