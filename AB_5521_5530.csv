"we present it-snow, a serially complete and multi-year snow reanalysis for italy (similar to 301 x 10(3) km(2)) - a transitional continental-to-mediterranean region where snow plays an important but still poorly constrained societal and ecological role. it-snow provides similar to 500 m daily maps of snow water equivalent (swe), snow depth, bulk snow density, and liquid water content for the initial period 1 september 2010-31 august 2021, with future updates envisaged on a regular basis. as the output of an operational chain employed in real-world civil protection applications (s3m italy), it-snow ingests input data from thousands of automatic weather stations, snow-covered-area maps from sentinel-2, modis (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer), and h saf products, as well as maps of snow depth from the spatialization of over 350 on-the-ground snow depth sensors. validation using sentinel-1-based maps of snow depth and a variety of independent, in situ snow data from three focus regions (aosta valley, lombardy, and molise) show little to no mean bias compared to the former, and root mean square errors are of the typical order of 30-60 cm and 90-300 mm for in situ, measured snow depth and snow water equivalent, respectively. estimates of peak swe by it-snow are also well correlated with annual streamflow at the closure section of 102 basins across italy (0.87), with ratios between peak water volume in snow and annual streamflow that are in line with expectations for this mixed rain-snow region (22 % on average and 12 % median). examples of use allowed us to estimate 13.70 +/- 4.9 gm3 of water volume stored in snow across the italian landscape at peak accumulation, which on average occurs on 4 march +/- 10 d. nearly 52 % of the mean seasonal swe is accumulated across the po river basin, followed by the adige river (23 %), and central apennines (5 %). it-snow is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7034956 (avanzi et al., 2022b) and can contribute to better constraining the role of snow for seasonal to annual water resources - a crucial endeavor in a warming and drier climate.",AB_0553
"skeletal muscles support the stability and mobility of the skeleton but differ in biome-chanical properties and physiological functions. the intrinsic factors that regulate muscle- specific characteristics are poorly understood. to study these, we constructed a large atlas of rna- seq profiles from six leg muscles and two locations from one muscle, using biopsies from 20 healthy young males. we identified differential expression patterns and cellular composition across the seven tissues using three bioinformatics approaches confirmed by large- scale newly developed quantitative immune- histology procedures. with all three procedures, the muscle samples clustered into three groups congruent with their anatomical location. concomitant with genes marking oxida -tive metabolism, genes marking fast-or slow- twitch myofibers differed between the three groups. the groups of muscles with higher expression of slow- twitch genes were enriched in endothelial cells and showed higher capillary content. in addition, expression profiles of homeobox (hox) transcription factors differed between the three groups and were confirmed by spatial rna hybrid-ization. we created an open- source graphical interface to explore and visualize the leg muscle atlas (https://tabbassidaloii.shinyapps.io/muscleatlasshinyapp/). our study reveals the molecular special-ization of human leg muscles, and provides a novel resource to study muscle- specific molecular features, which could be linked with (patho)physiological processes.",AB_0553
"background: uncontrolled hypertension is a major health problem, and a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease. most patients are detected and managed in primary care, but approximately 50% remains uncontrolled. our aim is to assess whether a guided stepwise work-up management strategy for patients with uncontrolled hypertension in primary care would result in better blood pressure control in these patients compared to usual care. methods: a cluster randomised controlled trial aiming at randomizing 40 general practices to either a protocolised stepwise work-up or to usual care. uncontrolled hypertension is defined as an office blood pressure (bp) >140/90 mmhg while being prescribed three or more antihypertensive drugs simultaneously from different therapeutic classes for three or more months in an adequate dose. in the intervention arm, patients with uncontrolled hypertension will receive the stepwise approach, consisting of (i) excluding a white coat effect, (ii) re-evaluation of lifestyle, (iii) re-evaluation of drug adherence, (iv) optimalisation of antihypertensive treatment and (v) referral if the office bp is still >140/90 mmhg. the control group receives usual care in a regular program for cardiovascular risk management. the primary outcome is the absolute difference in the mean 24-h systolic bp between intervention and control arm after 8 months. secondary outcomes include differences in the percentage of patients achieving a controlled bp, and time to reach a controlled bp.conclusion: if stepwise treatment of uncontrolled hypertension is proven effective, the strategy could be implemented by blending the approach to the cardiovascular risk management already applied in general practice.trial registration ntr7304, https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/7099",AB_0553
"background: the exact relation between anastomotic height after rectal cancer surgery and postoperative bowel function problems has not been investigated in the long term, resulting in ineffective treatment. objective: the goal of this study was to determine the effect of anastomotic height on long-term bowel function and generic quality of life. design: this was a multicenter, cross-sectional study. settings: seven hospitals in the north of the netherlands participated. patients: all patients who underwent rectal cancer surgery between 2009 and 2015 in participating hospitals received the validated defecation and fecal continence and short-form 36 questionnaires. deceased patients, patients with a permanent stoma or an anastomosis >15 cm from the anal verge, patients with intellectual disability, and patients living abroad were excluded. main outcome measures: primary outcomes were constipation (rome iv), fecal incontinence (rome iv), and major low anterior resection syndrome. secondary outcomes were the generic quality of life scores. results: the study population (n = 630) had a median follow-up of 58.0 months. in multivariable analysis, constipation (or = 1.08; 95% ci, 1.02-1.15; p = 0.011), fecal incontinence (or = 0.91; 95% ci, 0.84-0.97; p = 0.006), and major low anterior resection syndrome (or = 0.93; 95% ci, 0.87-0.99; p = 0.027), were significantly associated with anastomotic height. the curves illustrating the probability of constipation and fecal incontinence crossed at an anastomotic height of 7 cm, with 95% cis overlapping between 4.5 and 9.5 cm. there was no relation between quality-of-life scores and anastomotic height. limitations: the study is limited by its cross-sectional design. conclusions: this study might serve as a guide for the clinician to effectively screen and treat fecal incontinence and constipation during patient follow-up after rectal cancer surgery. more attention should be paid to fecal incontinence in patients with an anastomosis below 4.5 cm and toward constipation in patients with an anastomosis above 9.5 cm. see video abstract at http:// links.lww.com/dcr/b858.",AB_0553
"this paper proposes an active learning (al) algorithm to solve regression problems based on inverse-distance weighting functions for selecting the feature vectors to query. the algorithm has the following features: (i) supports both pool-based and population-based sampling; (ii) is not tailored to a particular class of predictors; (iii) can handle known and unknown constraints on the queryable feature vectors; and (iv) can run either sequen-tially, or in batch mode, depending on how often the predictor is retrained. the potentials of the method are shown in numerical tests on illustrative synthetic problems and real -world datasets. an implementation of the algorithm, that we call ideal (inverse-distance based exploration for active learning), is available at http://cse.lab. imtlucca.it/bemporad/ideal.(c) 2023 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.",AB_0553
"spatial audio methods are gaining a growing interest due to the spread of immersive audio experiences and applications, such as virtual and augmented reality. for these purposes, 3d audio signals are often acquired through arrays of ambisonics microphones, each comprising four capsules that decompose the sound field in spherical harmonics. in this paper, we propose a dual quaternion representation of the spatial sound field acquired through an array of two first order ambisonics (foa) microphones. the audio signals are encapsulated in a dual quaternion that leverages quaternion algebra properties to exploit correlations among them. this augmented representation with 6 degrees of freedom (6dof) involves a more accurate coverage of the sound field, resulting in a more precise sound localization and a more immersive audio experience. we evaluate our approach on a sound event localization and detection (seld) benchmark. we show that our dual quaternion seld model with temporal convolution blocks (dualqseld-tcn) achieves better results with respect to real and quaternion-valued baselines thanks to our augmented representation of the sound field. full code is available at: https://github.com/ispamm/dualqseld-tcn .

"we introduce a novel deep learning-based framework to interpret 3d urban scenes represented as textured meshes. based on the observation that object boundaries typically align with the boundaries of planar regions, our framework achieves semantic segmentation in two steps: planarity-sensible over-segmentation followed by semantic classification. the over-segmentation step generates an initial set of mesh segments that capture the planar and non-planar regions of urban scenes. in the subsequent classification step, we construct a graph that encodes the geometric and photometric features of the segments in its nodes and the multi-scale contextual features in its edges. the final semantic segmentation is obtained by classifying the segments using a graph convolutional network. experiments and comparisons on two semantic urban mesh benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of boundary quality, mean iou (intersection over union), and generalization ability. we also introduce several new metrics for evaluating mesh over-segmentation methods dedicated to semantic segmentation, and our proposed over segmentation approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. our source code is available at https://github.com/weixiaogao/pssnet.",AB_0553
"this paper presents a study on an automated system for image classification, which is based on the fusion of various deep learning methods. the study explores how to create an ensemble of different convolutional neural network (cnn) models and transformer topologies that are fine-tuned on several datasets to leverage their diversity. the research question addressed in this work is whether different optimization algorithms can help in developing robust and efficient machine learning systems to be used in different domains for classification purposes. to do that, we introduce novel adam variants. we employed these new approaches, coupled with several cnn topologies, for building an ensemble of classifiers that outperforms both other adam-based methods and stochastic gradient descent. additionally, the study combines the ensemble of cnns with an ensemble of transformers based on different topologies, such as deit, vit, swin, and coat. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in which an in-depth study of a set of transformers and convolutional neural networks in a large set of small/medium-sized images is carried out. the experiments performed on several datasets demonstrate that the combination of such different models results in a substantial performance improvement in all tested problems. all resources are available at https://github.com/lorisnanni.",AB_0553
"in latest years, deep learning (dl) has gained a leading role in the pansharpening of multiresolution images. given the lack of ground truth data, most dl-based methods carry out supervised training in a reduced-resolution domain. however, models trained on downsized images tend to perform poorly on high-resolution target images. for this reason, several research groups are now turning to unsupervised training in the full-resolution domain, through the definition of appropriate loss functions and training paradigms. in this context, we have recently proposed a full-resolution training framework that can be applied to many existing architectures. here, we propose a new dl-based pansharpening model that fully exploits the potential of this approach and provides cutting-edge performance. besides architectural improvements with respect to previous work, such as the use of residual attention modules, the proposed model features a novel loss function that jointly promotes the spectral and spatial quality of the pansharpened data. in addition, thanks to a new fine-tuning strategy, it improves inference-time adaptation to target images. experiments on a large variety of test images, performed in challenging scenarios, demonstrate that the proposed method compares favorably with the state-of-the-art both in terms of numerical results and visual output. the code is available online at https://github.com/matciotola/lambda-pnn.",AB_0553
"this paper presents a hierarchical framework with novel analytical and neural physics-driven models, to enable the online planning and tracking of minimum-time maneuvers, for a vehicle with partially-unknown parameters. we introduce a lateral speed prediction model for high-level motion planning with economic nonlinear model predictive control (e-nmpc). a low-level steering controller is developed with a novel feedforward-feedback physics-driven artificial neural network (nn). a longitudinal dynamic model is identified to tune a low-level speed-tracking controller. the high- and low-level control models are identified with an automatic three-step scheme, combining open-loop and closed-loop maneuvers to model the maximum acceleration g-g-v performance constraint for e-nmpc, and to capture the effect of the longitudinal acceleration on the lateral dynamics. the proposed framework is used in a simulation environment, for the online closed-loop control of a highly detailed sedan vehicle simulator, whose parameters are partially-unknown. two different circuits are adopted to validate the approach, and a robustness analysis is performed by varying the vehicle mass and the load distribution. a minimum-time optimal control problem is solved offline and used for a comparison with the closed-loop results. a video demonstrating both the automatic three-step identification scheme and the motion planning and control results is available at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq_t96ijgp8.",AB_0553
