"we propose text2motion, a language-based planning framework enabling robots to solve sequential manipulation tasks that require long-horizon reasoning. given a natural language instruction, our framework constructs both a task- and motion-level plan that is verified to reach inferred symbolic goals. text2motion uses feasibility heuristics encoded in q-functions of a library of skills to guide task planning with large language models. whereas previous language-based planners only consider the feasibility of individual skills, text2motion actively resolves geometric dependencies spanning skill sequences by performing geometric feasibility planning during its search. we evaluate our method on a suite of problems that require long-horizon reasoning, interpretation of abstract goals, and handling of partial affordance perception. our experiments show that text2motion can solve these challenging problems with a success rate of 82%, while prior state-of-the-art language-based planning methods only achieve 13%. text2motion thus provides promising generalization characteristics to semantically diverse sequential manipulation tasks with geometric dependencies between skills. qualitative results are made available at https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/text2motion.",AB_0568
"deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (vaes), generative adversarial networks (gans), diffusion models, and transformers, have shown great promise in a variety of applications, including image and speech synthesis, natural language processing, and drug discovery. however, when applied to engineering design problems, evaluating the performance of these models can be challenging, as traditional statistical metrics based on likelihood may not fully capture the requirements of engineering applications. this paper doubles as a review and practical guide to evaluation metrics for deep generative models (dgms) in engineering design. we first summarize the well-accepted 'classic' evaluation metrics for deep generative models grounded in machine learning theory. using case studies, we then highlight why these metrics seldom translate well to design problems but see frequent use due to the lack of established alternatives. next, we curate a set of design-specific metrics which have been proposed across different research communities and can be used for evaluating deep generative models. these metrics focus on unique requirements in design and engineering, such as constraint satisfaction, functional performance, novelty, and conditioning. throughout our discussion, we apply the metrics to models trained on simple-to-visualize 2-dimensional example problems. finally, we evaluate four deep generative models on a bicycle frame design problem and structural topology generation problem. in particular, we showcase the use of proposed metrics to quantify performance target achievement, design novelty, and geometric constraints. we publicly release the code for the datasets, models, and metrics used throughout the paper at https://decode. mit.edu/projects/metrics/.(c) 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0568
"classical shadows are estimators of an unknown quantum state, constructed from suitably distributed random measurements on copies of that state (huang et al. in nat phys 16:1050, 2020, https:// doi.org/10.1038/ s41567-020-0932- 7). in this paper, we analyze classical shadows obtained using random matchgate circuits, which correspond to fermionic gaussian unitaries. we prove that the first three moments of the haar distribution over the continuous group of matchgate circuits are equal to those of the discrete uniform distribution over only the matchgate circuits that are also clifford unitaries; thus, the latter forms a matchgate 3-design. this implies that the classical shadows resulting from the two ensembles are functionally equivalent. we show how one can use these matchgate shadows to efficiently estimate inner products between an arbitrary quantum state and fermionic gaussian states, as well as the expectation values of local fermionic operators and various other quantities, thus surpassing the capabilities of prior work. as a concrete application, this enables us to apply wavefunction constraints that control the fermion sign problem in the quantum-classical auxiliary-field quantum monte carlo algorithm (qc-afqmc) (huggins et al. innature 603:416, 2022, https:// doi.org/10.1038/ s41586-021- 04351- z), without the exponential post-processing cost incurred by the original approach.",AB_0568
"fossil capitate hydrozoans require exceptional conditions for preservation. here we describe bertratis ciurcae new genus, new species from the silurian (pridoli) of southern ontario and upper new york state, where it occurs in association with a diverse assemblage of eurypterids. only the float (pneumatophore) is well preserved, surviving as a thick carbonaceous compression. the new taxon is the largest fossil capitate reported, reaching a width of 17 cm, and the third porpita-like example known from the paleozoic. it was a rare pelagic component of the biota of the well-known bertie group lagerstatten.uuid: http://zoobank.org/1eb789e3-67b4-4e46-9baf-6320d4b67d6c",AB_0568
"this paper presents an efficient matlab code for the discrete adjoint-based level set method, which is compact and provided for 2d stress-constrained problems. the discrete adjoint-based level set method inherits the implicit representation of standard level set methods, but advances the design boundaries using discrete adjoint sensitivities instead of shape derivatives. this proposed method allows for the application of general mathematical programming algorithms, which can be conveniently extended to handle multiple constraints. the method of moving asymptotes (mma) is chosen as the mathematical programming solver. three typical stress-constrained volume minimization problems are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed level set code. the matlab code presented in this paper can be extended to resolve different 2d topology optimization problems. overall, the presented matlab code provides a useful tool for researchers and engineers working on stress-constrained 2d topology optimization problems with level set method. the matlab code used in this work can be downloaded from: https://github.com/denghaopitts/level-set-topology-optimization and is intended for educational purposes only.",AB_0568
"despite their superior performance, deep-learning methods often suffer from the disadvantage of needing large-scale well-annotated training data. in response, recent literature has seen a proliferation of efforts aimed at reducing the annotation burden. this paper focuses on a weakly-supervised training setting for single-cell segmentation models, where the only available training label is the rough locations of individual cells. the specific problem is of practical interest due to the widely available nuclei counter-stain data in biomedical literature, from which the cell locations can be derived programmatically. of more general interest is a proposed self-learning method called collaborative knowledge sharing, which is related to but distinct from the more well-known consistency learning methods. this strategy achieves self-learning by sharing knowledge between a principal model and a very light-weight collaborator model. importantly, the two models are entirely different in their architectures, capacities, and model outputs: in our case, the principal model approaches the segmentation problem from an object-detection perspective, whereas the collaborator model a sematic segmentation perspective. we assessed the effectiveness of this strategy by conducting experiments on livecell, a large single-cell segmentation dataset of bright-field images, and on a431 dataset, a fluorescence image dataset in which the location labels are generated automatically from nuclei counter-stain data. implementing code is available at https://github.com/jiyuuchc/lacss.",AB_0568
"background professional society conferences are integral to the medical profession. however, airline travel is a major contributor to greenhouse gas production, and the environmental impact of in-person attendance at an orthopaedic conference has yet to be described. with growing concern about the climate crisis, we sought to quantify the carbon footprint of in-person attendance to help potential attendees more consciously consider in-person attendance, inform strategies to minimize greenhouse gas emissions during travel to annual meetings, and increase awareness about and momentum for efforts in orthopaedic surgery to reduce the carbon footprint of society conferences. questions/purposes (1) what was the magnitude of greenhouse gas production resulting from all-in-person 2019 american orthopaedic foot and ankle society (aofas) annual meeting attendance in chicago, il, usa? (2) what was the magnitude of greenhouse gas production resulting from the all-virtual 2020 aofas annual meeting, and how does it compare with the 2019 aofas annual meeting carbon footprint? (3) to what extent could an alternative in-person meeting model with four or seven hubs decrease greenhouse gas production resulting from round-trip air travel compared with the 2019 aofas annual meeting? methods a list of the postal codes and countries of all 1271 registered participants attending the four-day 2019 aofas annual meeting in chicago, il, usa, was obtained from aofas headquarters. the 2019 conference was chosen because it was the last pre-covid meeting and thus attendance was more likely to resemble that at prepandemic in-person conferences than more recent meetings because of pandemic travel restrictions. we estimated carbon dioxideequivalent (co(2)e) production from round-trip air travel using a publicly available internet-based calculator (myclimate: https://co2.myclimate.org/en/flight_calculators/new). emissions produced by the conference venue, car travel, and hotel stays were estimated using published environmental protection agency emission factors. to estimate emissions produced by the all-virtual 2020 aofas annual meeting (assuming an equal number of attendees as in 2019), we used the framework published by faber and summed estimated network data transfer emissions, personal computer and monitor emissions, and server-related emissions. using the 2019 registrant list, we modeled four-hub and seven-hub in-person meeting alternatives to determine potential decreased round-trip air travel greenhouse gas production. meeting hub locations were selected by visualizing the geographic distribution of the 2019 registrants and selecting reasonable meeting locations that would minimize air travel for the greatest number of attendees. registrants were assigned to the nearest hub location. myclimate was again used to estimate co(2)e production for round-trip air travel for the hub meeting models. results the total estimated emissions of the all-in-person 2019 aofas annual meeting (when accounting for travel, conference space, and hotel stays) was 1565 tons co(2)e (median 0.61 tons per attendee, range 0.02 to 7.7 tons). the total estimated emissions of the all-virtual 2020 meeting (when accounting for network data transfer emissions, personal computer and monitor emissions, and server-related emissions) was 34 tons co(2)e (median 0.03 tons per attendee). this corresponds to a 97.8% decrease in co(2)e emissions compared with the in-person conference. the model of a four-hub in-person meeting alternative with meetings in chicago, santiago, london, and tokyo predicted an estimated 54% decrease in co(2)e emissions from round-trip air travel. the seven-hub meeting model with meetings in chicago; washington, dc; dallas; los angeles; santiago; london; and tokyo was predicted to diminish the co(2)e emissions of round-trip air travel by an estimated 71%. conclusion the 2019 aofas annual meeting had an enormous carbon footprint and resulted in many individuals exceeding their annual allotted carbon budget (2.5 tons) according to the paris agreement. hosting the meeting virtually greatly reduced the annual meeting carbon footprint, and our hub-based meeting models identified potential in-person alternatives for reducing the carbon footprint of conference attendance. clinical relevance professional societies must consider our responsibility to decarbonizing the healthcare sector by considering innovative approachesperhaps such as our multihub proposalsto decarbonize carbon-intensive annual meetings without stalling academic progress.",AB_0568
"screening colonoscopy is an important clinical application for several 3d computer vision techniques, including depth estimation, surface reconstruction, and missing region detection. however, the development, evaluation, and comparison of these techniques in real colonoscopy videos remain largely qualitative due to the difficulty of acquiring ground truth data. in this work, we present a colonoscopy 3d video dataset (c3vd) acquired with a high definition clinical colonoscope and high-fidelity colon models for benchmarking computer vision methods in colonoscopy. we introduce a novel multimodal 2d-3d registration technique to register optical video sequences with ground truth rendered views of a known 3d model. the different modalities are registered by transforming optical images to depth maps with a generative adversarial network and aligning edge features with an evolutionary optimizer. this registration method achieves an average translation error of 0.321 millimeters and an average rotation error of 0.159 degrees in simulation experiments where error-free ground truth is available. the method also leverages video information, improving registration accuracy by 55.6% for translation and 60.4% for rotation compared to single frame registration. 22 short video sequences were registered to generate 10,015 total frames with paired ground truth depth, surface normals, optical flow, occlusion, six degree-of-freedom pose, coverage maps, and 3d models. the dataset also includes screening videos acquired by a gastroenterologist with paired ground truth pose and 3d surface models. the dataset and registration source code are available at https://durr.jhu.edu/c3vd.",AB_0568
"recent advances in the sensitivity and speed of mass spectrometers coupled with improved sample preparation methods have enabled the field of single cell proteomics to proliferate. while heavy development is occurring in the label free space, dramatic improvements in throughput are provided by multiplexing with tandem mass tags. hundreds or thousands of single cells can be analyzed with this method, yielding large data sets which may contain poor data arising from loss of material during cell sorting or poor digestion, labeling, and lysis. to date, no tools have been described that can assess data quality prior to data processing. we present herein a lightweight python script and accompanying graphic user interface that can rapidly quantify reporter ion peaks within each ms/ms spectrum in a file. with simple summary reports, we can identify single cell samples that fail to pass a set quality threshold, thus reducing analysis time waste. in addition, this tool, diagnostic ion data analysis reduction (didar), will create reduced mgf files containing only spectra possessing a user-specified number of single cell reporter ions. by reducing the number of spectra that have excessive zero values, we can speed up sample processing with little loss in data completeness as these spectra are removed in later stages in data processing workflows. didar and the didar gui are compatible with all modern operating systems and are available at: https://github.com/orsburn/didarscpqc. all files described in this study are available at www.massive.ucsd.edu as accession msv000088887.",AB_0568
"quantitative structure-odor relationships are critically important for studies related to the function of olfaction. current literature data sets contain expert-labeled molecules but lack feature data. this paper introduces quantumscents, a quantum mechanics augmented derivative of the leffingwell data set. quantumscents contains 3.5k structurally and chemically diverse molecules ranging from 2 to 30 heavy atoms (cnos) and their corresponding 3d coordinates, total pbe0 energy, molecular dipole moment, and per-atom hirshfeld charges, dipoles, and ratios. the authors demonstrate that hirshfeld charges and ratios contain sufficient information to perform molecular classification by training a message passing neural network with chemprop (, doi: 10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-3zcfl) to predict scent labels. the quantumscents data set is freely available on zenodo along with the authors' code, example models, and data set generation workflow (https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8239853).",AB_0568
