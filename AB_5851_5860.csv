"surface downward shortwave radiation (dsr) and photosynthetically active radiation (par) play critical roles in the earth's surface processes. as the main inputs of various ecological, hydrological, carbon, and solar photovoltaic models, increasing requirements for high-spatiotemporal-resolution dsr and par estimation with high accuracy have been observed in recent years. however, few existing products satisfy all of these requirements. this study employed a well-established physical-based lookup table (lut) approach to the geonex gridded top-of-atmosphere bidirectional reflectance factor data acquired by the advanced himawari imager (ahi) and advanced baseline imager (abi) sensors. it produced a data product of dsr and par over both ahi and abi coverage at an hourly temporal step with a 1 km spatial resolution. geonex dsr data were validated over 63 stations, and geonex par data were validated over 27 stations. the validation showed that the new geonex dsr and par products have accuracy higher than other existing products, with root mean square error (rmse) of hourly geonex dsr achieving 74.3 w m(-2) (18.0 %), daily dsr estimation achieving 18.0 w m(-2)(9.2 %), hourly geonex par achieving 34.9 w m(-2) (19.6 %), and daily par achieving 9.5 w m(-2) (10.5 %). the study also demonstrated the application of the high-spatiotemporal-resolution geonex dsr product in investigating the spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability of surface solar radiation. the data product can be freely accessed through the nasa advanced supercomputing division geonex data portal: https://data.nas.nasa.gov/geonex/geonexdata/goes16/geonex-l2/dsr-par/ (last access: 12 march 2023) and https://data.nas.nasa.gov/geonex/geonexdata/himawari8/geonex-l2/dsr-par/ (last access: 12 march 2023) (; wang and li, 2022).",AB_0586
"background: scientists often make cognitive claims (eg, the results of their work) and normative claims (eg, what should be done based on those results). yet, these types of statements contain very different information and implications. this randomized controlled trial sought to characterize the granular effects of using normative language in science communication. objective: our study examined whether viewing a social media post containing scientific claims about face masks for covid-19 using both normative and cognitive language (intervention arm) would reduce perceptions of trust and credibility in science and scientists compared with an identical post using only cognitive language (control arm). we also examined whether effects were mediated by political orientation. methods: this was a 2-arm, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. we aimed to recruit 1500 us adults (age 18+) from the prolific platform who were representative of the us population census by cross sections of age, race/ethnicity, and gender. participants were randomly assigned to view 1 of 2 images of a social media post about face masks to prevent covid-19. the control image described the results of a real study (cognitive language), and the intervention image was identical, but also included recommendations from the same study about what people should do based on the results (normative language). primary outcomes were trust in science and scientists (21-item scale) and 4 individual items related to trust and credibility; 9 additional covariates (eg, sociodemographics, political orientation) were measured and included in analyses. results: from september 4, 2022, to september 6, 2022, 1526 individuals completed the study. for the sample as a whole (eg, without interaction terms), there was no evidence that a single exposure to normative language affected perceptions of trust or credibility in science or scientists. when including the interaction term (study arm x political orientation), there was some evidence of differential effects, such that individuals with liberal political orientation were more likely to trust scientific information from the social media post's author if the post included normative language, and political conservatives were more likely to trust scientific information from the post's author if the post included only cognitive language (beta=0.05, 95% ci 0.00 to 0.10; p=.04). conclusions: this study does not support the authors' original hypotheses that single exposures to normative language can reduce perceptions of trust or credibility in science or scientists for all people. however, the secondary preregistered analyses indicate the possibility that political orientation may differentially mediate the effect of normative and cognitive language from scientists on people's perceptions. we do not submit this paper as definitive evidence thereof but do believe that there is sufficient evidence to support additional research into this topic, which may have implications for effective scientific communication. trial registration: osf registries osf.io/kb3yh; https://osf.io/kb3yh international registered report identifier (irrid): rr2-10.2196/41747",AB_0586
"to study the mechanism by which nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) contributes to vascular endothelial nod-like receptor pyrin domain 3 (nlrp3) inflammasome activation and neointima hy-perplasia, nafld was established in high-fat diet (hfd)-treated asah1fl/fl/albcre (liver-specific deletion of the acid ceramidase gene asah1) mice. compared with asah1 flox [asah1fl/fl/wild type (wt)] and wild-type (wt/wt) mice, asah1fl/fl/albcre mice exhibited significantly enhanced ceramide levels and lipid deposition on hfd in the liver. moreover, asah1fl/fl/albcre mice showed enhanced expression of extracellular vesicle (ev) markers, cd63 and annexin ii, but attenuated lysosome-multivesicular body fusion. all these changes were accompanied by significantly increased ev counts in the plasma. in a mouse model of neointima hyperplasia, liver-specific deletion of the asah1 gene enhanced hfd-induced neointima proliferation, which was associated with increased endothelial nlrp3 inflammasome for-mation and activation and more severe endothelial damage. the evs isolated from plasma of asah1fl/fl/ albcre mice on hfd were found to markedly enhance nlrp3 inflammasome formation and activation in primary cultures of wt/wt endothelial cells compared with those isolated from wt/wt mice or normal diet-treated asah1fl/fl/albcre mice. these results suggest that the acid ceramidase/ceramide signaling pathway controls ev release from the liver, and its deficiency aggravates nafld and intensifies hepatic ev release into circulation, which promotes endothelial nlrp3 inflammasome activation and conse-quent neointima hyperplasia in the mouse carotid arteries.

"applying deep learning concepts from image detection and graph theory has greatly advanced protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, a challenge with enormous ramifica-tions for both drug discovery and protein engineering. we build upon these advances by designing a novel deep learning architecture consisting of a 3-dimensional convolutional neural network utilizing channel-wise attention and two graph convolu-tional networks utilizing attention-based aggregation of node features. hac-net (hybrid attention-based convolutional neural network) obtains state-of-the-art results on the pdbbind v.2016 core set, the most widely recognized benchmark in the field. we extensively assess the generalizability of our model using multiple train-test splits, each of which maximizes differences between either protein structures, protein sequences, or ligand extended -connectivity fingerprints of complexes in the training and test sets. furthermore, we perform 10-fold cross-validation with a similarity cutoff between smiles strings of ligands in the training and test sets and also evaluate the performance of hac-net on lower -quality data. we envision that this model can be extended to a broad range of supervised learning problems related to structure -based biomolecular property prediction. all of our software is available as an open-source repository at https://github.com/gregory-kyro/hac-net/, and the hacnet python package is available through pypi.",AB_0586
"ionospheric variability produces measurable effects in doppler shift of hf (high-frequency, 3-30 mhz) skywave signals. these effects are straightforward to measure with low-cost equipment and are conducive to citizen science campaigns. the low-cost personal spaceweather station (psws) network is a modular network of community-maintained, open-source receivers, which measure doppler shift in the precise carrier signals of time standard stations. the primary goal of this paper is to explain the types of measurements this instrument can make and some of its use cases, demonstrating its role as the building block for a large-scale ionospheric and hf propagation measurement network which complements existing professional networks. here, data from the psws network are presented for a period of time spanning late 2019 to early 2022. software tools for the visualization and analysis of this living dataset are also discussed and provided. these tools are robust to data interruptions and to the addition, removal or modification of stations, allowing both short- and long-term visualization at higher density and faster cadence than other methods. these data may be used to supplement observations made with other geospace instruments in event-based analyses, e.g., traveling ionospheric disturbances and solar flares, and to assess the accuracy of the bottomside estimates of ionospheric models by comparing the oblique paths obtained by ionospheric ray tracers with those obtained by these receivers. the data are archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6622111 (collins, 2022).",AB_0586
"objective: to examine delayed effects of theta-beta ratio (tbr) neurofeedback (nf) for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) 25 months after baseline, w21 months after end of treatment. method: children aged 7 to 10 years with rigorously diagnosed adhd had been randomized to 38 sessions of tbr nf (n = 84) or control treatment (n = 58) of identical appearance, intensity/frequency, and duration, differing only in that reinforcement for controls was based on a pre-recorded electroencephalogram (eeg) of another child. child, parent, and all site staff were blinded until after 25-month assessments, with only one-fourth able to guess the control treatment correctly. baseline assessments were repeated off medication after 25 months. results: of the 142 participants, 120 had 25-month follow-up (84.5% retention). only 12 participants (6 controls) had nf after the study treatment, greatly retaining the randomization. the primary outcome, parent-rated inattention, was not significantly different between treatments despite large pre -post effect sizes (nf recipients, d = 1.63; controls, d = 1.42). most secondary measures showed the same pattern. response rates (clinical global impression-improvement <2) were 58.6% of nf recipients and 66% of controls (not significant). marginally more controls than nf recipients needed medication (57.1% vs 38.6%, p = .059); specifically, 7.1% of nf recipients and 4% of controls had reduced medication need, whereas 34.3% of nf recipients and 50% of controls needed more medication (p = 0.084). conclusion: most of the large within-group improvement from the nf treatment package reported by unblinded studies and replicated in this blinded study reflects nonspecific effects, not specific effects of deliberate down-training of eeg theta-beta power ratio. at 25-month follow-up, it appears comparable to the evidence-based multimodal treatment study of adhd (mta) treatments, suggesting a psychotherapeutic/behavioral effect. clinical trial registration information: double-blind 2-site randomized clinical trial of neurofeedback for adhd; http://clinicaltrials.gov/; nct02251743. diversity & inclusion statement: we worked to ensure sex and gender balance in the recruitment of human participants. we worked to ensure race, ethnic, and/or other types of diversity in the recruitment of human participants. we worked to ensure that the study questionnaires were prepared in an inclusive way. one or more of the authors of this paper self-identifies as a member of one or more historically underrepresented sexual and/or gender groups in science. we actively worked to promote sex and gender balance in our author group.",AB_0586
"the applications of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning techniques in the field of materials science are becoming increasingly common due to their promising abilities to extract and utilize data-driven information from available data and accelerate materials discovery and design for future applications. in an attempt to assist with this process, we deploy predictive models for multiple material properties, given the composition of the material. the deep learning models described here are built using a cross-property deep transfer learning technique, which leverages source models trained on large data sets to build target models on small data sets with different properties. we deploy these models in an online software tool that takes a number of material compositions as input, performs preprocessing to generate composition-based attributes for each material, and feeds them into the predictive models to obtain up to 41 different material property values. the material property predictor is available online at http://ai.eecs.northwestern.edu/mppredictor.",AB_0586
"molecular structure recognition is the task of translating a molecular image into its graph structure. significant variation in drawing styles and conventions exhibited in chemical literature poses a significant challenge for automating this task. in this paper, we propose molscribe, a novel image-to-graph generation model that explicitly predicts atoms and bonds, along with their geometric layouts, to construct the molecular structure. our model flexibly incorporates symbolic chemistry constraints to recognize chirality and expand abbreviated structures. we further develop data augmentation strategies to enhance the model robustness against domain shifts. in experiments on both synthetic and realistic molecular images, molscribe significantly outperforms previous models, achieving 76-93% accuracy on public benchmarks. chemists can also easily verify molscribe's prediction, informed by its confidence estimation and atom-level alignment with the input image. molscribe is publicly available through python and web interfaces: https://github.com/thomas0809/molscribe.",AB_0586
"background: pharmacokinetic natural product-drug interactions (npdis) occur when botanical or other natural products are co-consumed with pharmaceutical drugs. with the growing use of natural products, the risk for potential npdis and consequent adverse events has increased. understanding mechanisms of npdis is key to preventing or minimizing adverse events. although biomedical knowledge graphs (kgs) have been widely used for drug-drug interaction applications, computational investigation of npdis is novel. we constructed np-kg as a first step toward computational discovery of plausible mechanistic explanations for pharmacokinetic npdis that can be used to guide scientific research.methods: we developed a large-scale, heterogeneous kg with biomedical ontologies, linked data, and full texts of the scientific literature. to construct the kg, biomedical ontologies and drug databases were integrated with the phenotype knowledge translator framework. the semantic relation extraction systems, semrep and integrated network and dynamic reasoning assembler, were used to extract semantic predications (subject-relation-object triples) from full texts of the scientific literature related to the exemplar natural products green tea and kratom. a literature-based graph constructed from the predications was integrated into the ontology-grounded kg to create np-kg. np-kg was evaluated with case studies of pharmacokinetic green tea-and kratom-drug interactions through kg path searches and meta-path discovery to determine congruent and contradictory information in np-kg compared to ground truth data. we also conducted an error analysis to identify knowledge gaps and incorrect predications in the kg. results: the fully integrated np-kg consisted of 745,512 nodes and 7,249,576 edges. evaluation of np-kg resulted in congruent (38.98% for green tea, 50% for kratom), contradictory (15.25% for green tea, 21.43% for kratom), and both congruent and contradictory (15.25% for green tea, 21.43% for kratom) information compared to ground truth data. potential pharmacokinetic mechanisms for several purported npdis, including the green tea-raloxifene, green tea-nadolol, kratom-midazolam, kratom-quetiapine, and kratom-venlafaxine in-teractions were congruent with the published literature.conclusion: np-kg is the first kg to integrate biomedical ontologies with full texts of the scientific literature focused on natural products. we demonstrate the application of np-kg to identify known pharmacokinetic in-teractions between natural products and pharmaceutical drugs mediated by drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. future work will incorporate context, contradiction analysis, and embedding-based methods to enrich np-kg. np-kg is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6814507. the code for relation extraction, kg construction, and hypothesis generation is available at https://github.com/sanyabt/np-kg.",AB_0586
"the convolutional neural network (cnn) is one of the most commonly used architectures for computer vision tasks. the key building block of a cnn is the convolutional kernel that aggregates information from the pixel neighborhood and shares weights across all pixels. a standard cnn's capacity, and thus its performance, is directly related to the number of learnable kernel weights, which is determined by the number of channels and the kernel size (support). in this paper, we present the hyper-convolution, a novel building block that implicitly encodes the convolutional kernel using spatial coordinates. unlike a regular convolutional kernel, whose weights are independently learned, hyper-convolution kernel weights are correlated through an encoder that maps spatial coordinates to their corresponding values. hyper-convolutions decouple kernel size from the total number of learnable parameters, enabling a more flexible architecture design. we demonstrate in our experiments that replacing regular convolutions with hyper-convolutions can improve performance with less parameters, and increase robustness against noise. we provide our code here: https://github.com/tym002/ hyper-convolution.",AB_0586
