"existing methods for 3d tracking from monocular rgb videos predominantly consider articulated and rigid objects (e.g., two hands or humans interacting with rigid environments). modelling dense non-rigid object deformations in this setting (e.g. when hands are interacting with a face), remained largely unaddressed so far, although such effects can improve the realism of the downstream applications such as ar/vr, 3d virtual avatar communications, and character animations. this is due to the severe ill-posedness of the monocular view setting and the associated challenges (e.g., in acquiring a dataset for training and evaluation or obtaining the reasonable non-uniform stiffness of the deformable object). while it is possible to naively track multiple non-rigid objects independently using 3d templates or parametric 3d models, such an approach would suffer from multiple artefacts in the resulting 3d estimates such as depth ambiguity, unnatural intra-object collisions and missing or implausible deformations. hence, this paper introduces the first method that addresses the fundamental challenges depicted above and that allows tracking human hands interacting with human faces in 3d from single monocular rgb videos. we model hands as articulated objects inducing non-rigid face deformations during an active interaction. our method relies on a new hand-face motion and interaction capture dataset with realistic face deformations acquired with a markerless multi-view camera system. as a pivotal step in its creation, we process the reconstructed raw 3d shapes with position-based dynamics and an approach for non-uniform stiffness estimation of the head tissues, which results in plausible annotations of the surface deformations, handface contact regions and head-hand positions. at the core of our neural approach are a variational auto-encoder supplying the hand-face depth prior and modules that guide the 3d tracking by estimating the contacts and the deformations. our final 3d hand and face reconstructions are realistic and more plausible compared to several baselines applicable in our setting, both quantitatively and qualitatively. https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/decaf",AB_0453

"structural variants (svs) represent a major source of genetic variation associated with phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility. while long-read sequencing can discover over 20,000 svs per human genome, interpreting their functional consequences remains challenging. existing methods for identifying disease-related svs focus on deletion/duplication only and cannot prioritize individual genes affected by svs, especially for noncoding svs. here, we introduce phenosv, a phenotype-aware machine-learning model that interprets all major types of svs and genes affected. phenosv segments and annotates svs with diverse genomic features and employs a transformer-based architecture to predict their impacts under a multiple-instance learning framework. with phenotype information, phenosv further utilizes gene-phenotype associations to prioritize phenotype-related svs. evaluation on extensive human sv datasets covering all sv types demonstrates phenosv's superior performance over competing methods. applications in diseases suggest that phenosv can determine disease-related genes from svs. a web server and a command-line tool for phenosv are available at https://phenosv.wglab.org.",AB_0453
"the modomics database was updated with recent data and now includes new data types related to rna modifications. changes to the database include an expanded modification catalog, encompassing both natural and synthetic residues identified in rna structures. this addition aids in representing rna sequences from the rcsb pdb database more effectively. to manage the increased number of modifications, adjustments to the nomenclature system were made. updates in the rna sequences section include the addition of new sequences and the reintroduction of sequence alignments for trnas and rrnas. the protein section was updated and connected to structures from the rcsb pdb database and predictions by alphafold. modomics now includes a data annotation system, with 'evidence' and 'estimated reliability' features, offering clarity on data support and accuracy. this system is open to all modomics entries, enhancing the accuracy of rna modification data representation. modomics is available at https://iimcb.genesilico.pl/modomics/. graphical abstract",AB_0453

"introductionpost-stroke dysphagia is common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality, rendering bedside screening of significant clinical importance. using voice as a biomarker coupled with deep learning has the potential to improve patient access to screening and mitigate the subjectivity associated with detecting voice change, a component of several validated screening protocols.methodsin this single-center study, we developed a proof-of-concept model for automated dysphagia screening and evaluated the performance of this model on training and testing cohorts. patients were admitted to a comprehensive stroke center, where primary english speakers could follow commands without significant aphasia and participated on a rolling basis. the primary outcome was classification either as a pass or fail equivalent using a dysphagia screening test as a label. voice data was recorded from patients who spoke a standardized set of vowels, words, and sentences from the national institute of health stroke scale. seventy patients were recruited and 68 were included in the analysis, with 40 in training and 28 in testing cohorts, respectively. speech from patients was segmented into 1,579 audio clips, from which 6,655 mel-spectrogram images were computed and used as inputs for deep-learning models (densenet and convnext, separately and together). clip-level and participant-level swallowing status predictions were obtained through a voting method.resultsthe models demonstrated clip-level dysphagia screening sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 77% (f1 = 0.73, auc = 0.80 [95% ci: 0.78-0.82]). at the participant level, the sensitivity and specificity were 89 and 79%, respectively (f1 = 0.81, auc = 0.91 [95% ci: 0.77-1.05]).discussionthis study is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of applying deep learning to classify vocalizations to detect post-stroke dysphagia. our findings suggest potential for enhancing dysphagia screening in clinical settings. https://github.com/uoftneurology/masa-open-source.",AB_0453
"the profiling of multiple molecular layers from the same set of cells has recently become possible. there is thus a growing need for multi-view learning methods able to jointly analyze these data. we here present multi-omics wasserstein integrative analysis (mowgli), a novel method for the integration of paired multi-omics data with any type and number of omics. of note, mowgli combines integrative nonnegative matrix factorization and optimal transport, enhancing at the same time the clustering performance and interpretability of integrative nonnegative matrix factorization. we apply mowgli to multiple paired single-cell multi-omics data profiled with 10x multiome, cite-seq, and tea-seq. our in-depth benchmark demonstrates that mowgli's performance is competitive with the state-of-the-art in cell clustering and superior to the state-of-the-art once considering biological interpretability. mowgli is implemented as a python package seamlessly integrated within the scverse ecosystem and it is available at http://github.com/cantinilab/mowgli. mowgli is a novel paired single-cell multi-omics integration method leveraging matrix factorization and optimal transport. in-depth benchmarking demonstrates promising cell clustering results and improved biological interpretability.",AB_0453
"backgroundthere is an increasing interest in assessing paraspinal morphology and composition in relation to low back pain (lbp). however, variations in methods and segmentation protocols contribute to the inconsistent findings in the literature. we present an on-line resource, the paraspinal muscle segmentation project (pillar, https://projectpillar.github.io/), to provide a detailed description and visual guide of a segmentation protocol by using the publicly available itk-snap software and discuss related challenges when performing paraspinal lumbar muscles segmentations from magnetic resonance imaging (mri).methodst2-weighted and corresponding fat-water ideal axial mri from 3 males and 3 females (2 chronic lbp and 1 control for each sex) were used to demonstrate our segmentation protocol for each lumbar paraspinal muscle (erector spinae, lumbar multifidus, quadratus lumborum and psoas) and lumbar spinal level (l1-l5).resultsproper segmentation requires an understanding of the anatomy of paraspinal lumbar muscles and the variations in paraspinal muscle morphology and composition due to age, sex, and the presence of lbp or related spinal pathologies. other challenges in segmentation includes the presence and variations of intramuscular and epimuscular fat, and side-to-side asymmetry.conclusionthe growing interest to assess the lumbar musculature and its role in the development and recurrence of lbp prompted the need for comprehensive and easy-to-follow resources, such as the pillar project to reduce inconsistencies in segmentation protocols. standardizing manual muscle measurements from mri will facilitate comparisons between studies while the field is progressively moving towards the automatization of paraspinal muscle measurements for large cohort studies.",AB_0453
"motivation: common human diseases result from the interplay of genes and their biologically associated pathways. genetic pathway analyses provide more biological insight as compared to conventional gene-based analysis. in this article, we propose a framework combining genetic data into pathway structure and using an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (cnns) along with a canonical correlation regularizer layer for comprehensive prediction of disease risk. the novelty of our approach lies in our two-step framework: (i) utilizing the cnn's effectiveness to extract the complex gene associations within individual genetic pathways and (ii) fusing features from ensemble of cnns through canonical correlation regularization layer to incorporate the interactions between pathways which share common genes. during prediction, we also address the important issues of interpretability of neural network models, and identifying the pathways and genes playing an important role in prediction. results: implementation of our methodology into three real cancer genetic datasets for different prediction tasks validates our model's generalizability and robustness. comparing with conventional models, our methodology provides consistently better performance with auc improvement of 11% on predicting early/late-stage kidney cancer, 10% on predicting kidney versus liver cancer type and 7% on predicting survival status in ovarian cancer as compared to the next best conventional machine learning model. the robust performance of our deep learning algorithm indicates that disease prediction using neural networks in multiple functionally related genes across different pathways improves genetic data-based prediction and understanding molecular mechanisms of diseases. availability and implementation: https://github.com/divya031090/regenne.",AB_0453
