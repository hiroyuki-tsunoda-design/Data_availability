Task OverviewAnalyze exactly 10 abstracts (AB) and their associated Web of Science Unique Article Identifiers (UT).For each abstract, determine whether the text contains at least one explicit URL that provides access to data, code, or other research outputs associated with the study described in the abstract.Primary evidence must come from the abstract text.General external knowledge (e.g., common repository functions, publishing practices) may be used to support interpretation.Assume a URL refers to outputs of the study unless the abstract explicitly states otherwise.When reasonable doubt exists, default to Yes rather than No.Step 1 Å\ URL Detection (Strict & Mechanical)A string qualifies as a URL only if:1. It begins exactly with http:// or https://2. It appears explicitly in the abstract3. Trailing punctuation (. , ; : ) ] }) is trimmedDo NOT count as URLs (treated as ÅgNo URL foundÅh):* Shortened URLs (bit.ly, tinyurl, t.co, goo.gl, etc.)* ftp:// links* DOI references not in URL form (e.g., doi:10.1234/...)* Email addresses or accession numbers without a full URLDecision Rule* No eligible URLs Å® Result: No URL found* ?1 eligible URL Å® Proceed to Step 2Step 2 Å\ Determine Whether the URL Provides Outputs Associated With This StudyA URL qualifies as Yes if both (A) and (B) are satisfied.(A) The abstract indicates that the URL provides research-related outputsAccepted terms include (non-exhaustive):* ÅgdataÅh, ÅgdatasetÅh, ÅgcodeÅh, ÅgsoftwareÅh* ÅgmaterialsÅh, ÅgresourcesÅh* Ågsupporting dataÅh, Ågsupporting informationÅh* Ågsupplementary materialsÅh* Ågreproducibility filesÅh, Åganalysis filesÅhExamples:* ÅgData are available at [URL]Åh* ÅgCode can be accessed at [URL]Åh* ÅgSupporting information is provided at [URL]Åh* ÅgResources are available at [URL]ÅhIf the abstract states that any research-related materials are available at the URL,Condition A is satisfied unless the text clearly contradicts this interpretation.(B) The outputs can reasonably be inferred to belong to the studyThe URL qualifies if:* The abstract explicitly links it to the study(Ågthis studyÅh, Ågour studyÅh, Ågour dataÅh, etc.)OR* The abstract states that data, code, or materials are available at the URL without indicating they belong to another studyInference rule:If a URL in an abstract is described as hosting research-related materials,assume they are for the study described in the abstract unless explicitly stated otherwise.External knowledge (e.g., Zenodo, GitHub, Dryad commonly host research outputs) may support inference.DOI URL Rule (Inclusive)For DOI URLs (https://doi.org/...):* The journal name does NOT need to appear in the abstract* Classify as Yes if the abstract indicates that the DOI provides: o datao datasetso codeo supplementary/supporting materialsIf the DOI is mentioned only as the article identifier Å® No.Refined Exclusions (Only When Explicit)Classify a URL as No only if the abstract explicitly states that it links to:* A generic institutional, laboratory, or project homepage with no study outputs* Third-party datasets or tools not produced by this study* Publisher or journal landing pages* ÅgGuide for authorsÅh pages* DOI URLs that clearly refer only to the article itselfIf there is no explicit exclusion, default to Yes.Step 3 Å\ Final Result* Yes: At least one URL plausibly provides data, code, or research outputs associated with the study* No: URL(s) exist, but the abstract explicitly states they do not provide such outputs* No URL found: No eligible URL detected in Step 1 (includes shortened URLs)Output Format (CSV Required)Produce exactly 10 rows with the following columns:Åú Output file name must be the input file name with "_result" appended. (Example: AB_0001_0010.csv Å® AB_0001_0010_Copilot_result.csv)No, UT, Result, ReasonExample Reason values:* ÅgStudy data available at repository URLÅh* ÅgSupporting materials provided via DOIÅh* ÅgURL explicitly refers to third-party datasetÅh* ÅgURL links to general institutional homepage without outputsÅh* ÅgShortened URL (not eligible)Åh* ÅgNo explicit http/https URL foundÅhExample:1,[UT],Yes,Study data and code available at repository URL2,[UT],Yes,Supporting materials provided via DOI URL3,[UT],No,URL explicitly refers to third-party dataset4,[UT],No URL found,No explicit http/https URL provided5,[UT],No URL found,Shortened URL (destination indeterminate)
