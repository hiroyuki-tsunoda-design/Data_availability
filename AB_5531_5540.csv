"background: people who smoke and who face challenges trying to quit or wish to continue to smoke may benefit by switching from traditional cigarettes to noncombustible nicotine delivery alternatives, such as heated tobacco products (htps) and electronic cigarettes (ecs). htps and ecs are being increasingly used to quit smoking, but there are limited data about their effectiveness.objective: we conducted the first randomized controlled trial comparing quit rates between htps and ecs among people who smoke and do not intend to quit. methods: we conducted a 12-week randomized noninferiority switching trial to compare effectiveness, tolerability, and product satisfaction between htps (iqos 2.4 plus) and refillable ecs (justfog q16) among people who do not intend to quit. the cessation intervention included motivational counseling. the primary endpoint of the study was the carbon monoxide-confirmed continuous abstinence rate from week 4 to week 12 (car weeks 4-12). the secondary endpoints included the continuous self-reported >= 50% reduction in cigarette consumption rate (continuous reduction rate) from week 4 to week 12 (crr weeks 4-12) and 7-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence.results: a total of 211 participants completed the study. high quit rates (car weeks 4-12) of 39.1% (43/110) and 30.8% (33/107) were observed for iqos-htp and justfog-ec, respectively. the between-group difference for the car weeks 4-12 was not significant (p=.20). the crr weeks 4-12 values for iqos-htp and justfog-ec were 46.4% (51/110) and 39.3% (42/107), respectively, and the between-group difference was not significant (p=.24). at week 12, the 7-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence values for iqos-htp and justfog-ec were 54.5% (60/110) and 41.1% (44/107), respectively. the most frequent adverse events were cough and reduced physical fitness. both study products elicited a moderately pleasant user experience, and the between-group difference was not significant. a clinically relevant improvement in exercise tolerance was observed after switching to the combustion-free products under investigation. risk perception for conventional cigarettes was consistently higher than that for the combustion-free study products under investigation.conclusions: switching to htps elicited a marked reduction in cigarette consumption among people who smoke and do not intend to quit, which was comparable to refillable ecs. user experience and risk perception were similar between the htps and ecs under investigation. htps may be a useful addition to the arsenal of reduced-risk alternatives for tobacco cigarettes and may contribute to smoking cessation. however, longer follow-up studies are required to confirm significant and prolonged abstinence from smoking and to determine whether our results can be generalized outside smoking cessation services offering high levels of support.trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct03569748; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03569748",AB_0554
"recent research has found that neural networks for computer vision are vulnerable to several types of external attacks that modify the input of the model, with the malicious intent of producing a misclassification. with the increase in the number of feasible attacks, many defence approaches have been proposed to mitigate the effect of these attacks and protect the models. mainly, the research on both attack and defence has focused on rgb images, while other domains, such as the infrared domain, are currently underexplored. in this paper, we propose two attacks, and we evaluate them on multiple datasets and neural network models, showing that the results outperform others established attacks, on both rgb as well as infrared domains. in addition, we show that our proposal can be used in an adversarial training protocol to produce more robust models, with respect to both adversarial attacks and natural perturbations that can be applied to input images. lastly, we study if a successful attack in a domain can be transferred to an aligned image in another domain, without any further tuning. the code, containing all the files and the configurations used to run the experiments, is available https://github.com/jaryp/ir-rgb-domain-attackonline.",AB_0554
"human-object interaction (hoi) detection recognizes how persons interact with objects, which is advantageous in autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles and collaborative robots. however, current hoi detectors are often plagued by model inefficiency and unreliability when making a prediction, which consequently limits its potential for real-world scenarios. in this paper, we address these challenges by proposing ernet, an end-to-end trainable convolutional-transformer network for hoi detection. the proposed model employs an efficient multi-scale deformable attention to effectively capture vital hoi features. we also put forward a novel detection attention module to adaptively generate semantically rich instance and interaction tokens. these tokens undergo pre-emptive detections to produce initial region and vector proposals that also serve as queries which enhances the feature refinement process in the transformer decoders. several impactful enhancements are also applied to improve the hoi representation learning. additionally, we utilize a predictive uncertainty estimation framework in the instance and interaction classification heads to quantify the uncertainty behind each prediction. by doing so, we can accurately and reliably predict hois even under challenging scenarios. experiment results on the hico-det, v-coco, and hoi-a datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in detection accuracy and training efficiency. codes are publicly available at https://github.com/monash-cyphi-ai-research-lab/ernet.",AB_0554
"background: colon cancer affects a patient's ability to work. many patients who have colon cancer are employed at the time of diagnosis. objective: we evaluated work ability during the first 2 years after colon cancer diagnosis. design: this study is a national prospective study, the prospective dutch colorectal cancer cohort, including clinical data and patient-reported outcomes. settings: data were collected in 59 medical centers in the netherlands. patients: patients <67 years of age with stage i to iv colon cancer and who completed work ability index questionnaires were selected. main outcome measures: work ability was assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. the work ability index (range, 0 to 49) was evaluated using linear mixed models. outcomes were matched to population controls without cancer. results: of 390 patients, 84% had paid employment. work ability of patients with stage i to iv colon cancer was significantly lower at the time of diagnosis than in matched population controls (31 +/- 8.2 and 41 +/- 5.6). patients with stage i to iii disease receiving surgery only regained work ability index scores comparable to matched population controls at 18 months. patients receiving adjuvant systemic treatment initially demonstrated a decrease in work ability with improvements from 6 months onward and normalization at 24 months. patients with stage iv disease did not demonstrate improvements in work ability outcomes over time. work ability scores were negatively influenced by the administration of systemic treatment and >= 1 comorbidities. limitations: only patients with patient-reported outcomes and work at baseline were included in this analysis. also, questionnaire response rates decreased over time. conclusions: work ability in patients with colon cancer is decreased for a prolonged time. recovery depends on disease stage, type of treatment, and comorbidities. patients with stage i to iii disease treated with curative surgery alone were the first to regain work ability, followed by patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy. patients with stage iv disease did not regain work ability. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b759.",AB_0554
"backgroundflux balance analysis (fba) is a key metabolic modeling method used to simulate cellular metabolism under steady-state conditions. its simplicity and versatility have led to various strategies incorporating transcriptomic and proteomic data into fba, successfully predicting flux distribution and phenotypic results. however, despite these advances, the untapped potential lies in leveraging gene-related connections like co-expression patterns for valuable insights.resultsto fill this gap, we introduce icon-gems, an innovative constraint-based model to incorporate gene co-expression network into the fba model, facilitating more precise determination of flux distributions and functional pathways. in this study, transcriptomic data from both escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae were integrated into their respective genome-scale metabolic models. a comprehensive gene co-expression network was constructed as a global view of metabolic mechanism of the cell. by leveraging quadratic programming, we maximized the alignment between pairs of reaction fluxes and the correlation of their corresponding genes in the co-expression network. the outcomes notably demonstrated that icon-gems outperformed existing methodologies in predictive accuracy. flux variabilities over subsystems and functional modules also demonstrate promising results. furthermore, a comparison involving different types of biological networks, including protein-protein interactions and random networks, reveals insights into the utilization of the co-expression network in genome-scale metabolic engineering.conclusionicon-gems introduce an innovative constrained model capable of simultaneous integration of gene co-expression networks, ready for board application across diverse transcriptomic data sets and multiple organisms. it is freely available as open-source at https://github.com/thummaratpaklao/icom-gems.git.",AB_0554
"backgroundthe specific recognition of a dna locus by a given transcription factor is a widely studied issue. it is generally agreed that the recognition can be influenced not only by the binding motif but by the larger context of the binding site. in this work, we present a novel heuristic algorithm that can reconstruct the unique binding sites captured in a sequencing experiment without using the reference genome.resultswe present paperfly, the partial assembly-based peak finder, a tool for the binding site and binding context reconstruction from the sequencing data without any prior knowledge. this tool operates without the need to know the reference genome of the respective organism. we employ algorithmic approaches that are used during genome assembly. the proposed algorithm constructs a de bruijn graph from the sequencing data. based on this graph, sequences and their enrichment are reconstructed using a novel heuristic algorithm. the reconstructed sequences are aligned and the peaks in the sequence enrichment are identified. our approach was tested by processing several chip-seq experiments available in the encode database and comparing the results of paperfly and standard methods.conclusionswe show that paperfly, an algorithm tailored for experiment analysis without the reference genome, yields better results than an aggregation of chip-seq agnostic tools. our tool is freely available at https://github.com/caeph/paperfly/ or on zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7116424).",AB_0554

"older adults have limitations from their aging process and chronic disease, so developed interventions must pay attention and concern to their aging degeneration and needs. this study aims to study the effects of a symptom management program on selected health outcomes among older people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. the quasi-experimental research included the 15 older patients in the control group receiving routine nursing care, while the other 15 in the experimental group received a 4-week symptom management program. first, the general information was analyzed using descriptive statistics. next, the average health outcomes were analyzed using independent and dependent t-tests, mann-whitney u test, and wilcoxon signed ranks test. in addition, the readmission rate was compared using fisher's exact test. results revealed that most of the older patients were men (96.7%), aged 60-88 years (mean = 71.57, sd = 7.75), with a smoking history (93.3%). the improvements were found in dyspnea (p < .01), its severity during activities (p < .01), and the quality of life (p = .04) among patients who attended the program. however, both groups did not have a different pulmonary function (p = .25) and the proportion of readmission within 28 days (p = .50). this study shows that the symptom management program can reduce dyspnea and severity during activities and improve the quality of life. older people suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially when experiencing dyspnea. therefore, it is crucial to have a symptom management program for older patients, especially a program developed to respond to changes in the aging process and the limitations of older people. this developed program was age-friendly to deal with symptoms and improve quality of life. however, this program should be explored in typical situations without the effects of the coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic. in addition, more extensive population-based studies and randomized controlled trials should be adopted to increase credibility and ensure generalization.clinical trial registration number: https://osf.io/6sj7y (october 4, 2021).",AB_0554
"backgroundearly detection of prediabetes and diabetes better prevents long-term health complications. fpg and hba1c levels are some common laboratory tests utilized as tools to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes, but the agreement rate between these two diagnostic tests varies, which could lead to underdiagnosis and thus undertreatment. this study aimed to analyze the agreement rate between fpg and hba1c, as well as the physicians' accuracy of using these results to make a prediabetes or diabetes diagnosis through icd-10 coding at a tertiary care hospital in bangkok, thailand.methodsa cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted using secondary data collected in a tertiary hospital's check-up clinic from august 16, 2019 to june 30, 2022 to study the prevalence and diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes, determined through fpg and hba1c laboratory results. we analyzed the two laboratory tests' diagnosis agreement rate and the physicians' accuracy of diagnosing diabetes and prediabetes in icd-10 coding using the fpg and hba1c results.resultsamong 8,024 asymptomatic participants, the period prevalence diagnosed through laboratory results was 5.8% for diabetes and 19.8% for prediabetes. diabetes and prediabetes prevalence based on laboratory data differs from that of icd-10 coding data. specifically, 79.6% of diabetes patients and 32.3% of prediabetes patients were coded using the icd-10 coding system. 4,094 individuals had both fpg and hba1c data. the agreement rate for diagnosing diabetes and prediabetes between the two laboratory results is 89.5%, with kappa statistics of 0.58. using only one of the two laboratory results would have missed a substantial number of patients.conclusionour findings highlight screening test discrepancies and underdiagnosis issues that impede diagnostic accuracy enhancement and refined patient management strategies. early diagnoses of prediabetes and diabetes, especially before symptoms arise, could increase health consciousness in individuals, thereby enabling the implementation of lifestyle modifications and prevention of serious health complications. we emphasize the importance of diagnosing these conditions using both fpg and hba1c, along with subsequent accurate icd-10 coding. even though some hospitals lack certified hba1c testing, we suggest enhancing the availability of hba1c testing, which could benefit many people in thailand.clinical trial registration:https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org, identifier [tctr20230824003].conclusionour findings highlight screening test discrepancies and underdiagnosis issues that impede diagnostic accuracy enhancement and refined patient management strategies. early diagnoses of prediabetes and diabetes, especially before symptoms arise, could increase health consciousness in individuals, thereby enabling the implementation of lifestyle modifications and prevention of serious health complications. we emphasize the importance of diagnosing these conditions using both fpg and hba1c, along with subsequent accurate icd-10 coding. even though some hospitals lack certified hba1c testing, we suggest enhancing the availability of hba1c testing, which could benefit many people in thailand.clinical trial registration:https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org, identifier [tctr20230824003].conclusionour findings highlight screening test discrepancies and underdiagnosis issues that impede diagnostic accuracy enhancement and refined patient management strategies. early diagnoses of prediabetes and diabetes, especially before symptoms arise, could increase health consciousness in individuals, thereby enabling the implementation of lifestyle modifications and prevention of serious health complications. we emphasize the importance of diagnosing these conditions using both fpg and hba1c, along with subsequent accurate icd-10 coding. even though some hospitals lack certified hba1c testing, we suggest enhancing the availability of hba1c testing, which could benefit many people in thailand.clinical trial registration:https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org, identifier [tctr20230824003].",AB_0554
