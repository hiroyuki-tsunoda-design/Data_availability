"in recent years, a huge amount of data on ncrna interactions has been described in scientific papers and databases. although considerable effort has been made to annotate the available knowledge in public repositories, there are still significant discrepancies in how different resources capture and interpret data on ncrna functional and physical associations. in the present paper, we present a collection of microrna-mrna interactions annotated from the scientific literature following recognized standard criteria and focused on micrornas, which regulate genes associated with rare diseases as a case study. the list of protein-coding genes with a known role in specific rare diseases was retrieved from the genome england panelapp, and associated microrna-mrna interactions were annotated in the intact database and compared with other datasets. rnacentral identifiers were used for unambiguous, stable identification of ncrnas. the information about the interaction was enhanced by a detailed description of the cell types and experimental conditions, providing a computer-interpretable summary of the published data, integrated with the huge amount of protein interactions already gathered in the database. furthermore, for each interaction, the binding sites of the microrna are precisely mapped on a well-defined mrna transcript of the target gene. this information is crucial to conceive and design optimal microrna mimics or inhibitors to interfere in vivo with a deregulated process. as these approaches become more feasible, high-quality, reliable networks of microrna interactions are needed to help, for instance, in the selection of the best target to be inhibited and to predict potential secondary off-target effects.database url https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact",AB_0438
"video streams are utilised to guide minimally-invasive surgery and diagnosis in a wide range of procedures, and many computer-assisted techniques have been developed to automatically analyse them. these approaches can provide additional information to the surgeon such as lesion detection, instrument navigation, or anatomy 3d shape modelling. however, the necessary image features to recognise these patterns are not always reliably detected due to the presence of irregular light patterns such as specular highlight reflections. in this paper, we aim at removing specular highlights from endoscopic videos using machine learning. we propose using temporal generative adversarial network (gan) to inpaint the hidden anatomy under specularities, inferring its appearance spatially and from neighbouring frames, where they are not present in the same location. this is achieved using in-vivo data from gastric endoscopy (hyper kvasir) in a fully unsupervised manner that relies on the automatic detection of specular highlights. system evaluations show significant improvements to other methods through direct comparison and ablation studies that depict the importance of the network's temporal and transfer learning components. the generalisability of our system to different surgical setups and procedures was also evaluated qualitatively on in-vivo data of gastric endoscopy and ex-vivo porcine data (serv-ct, scared). we also assess the effect of our method in comparison to other methods on computer vision tasks that underpin 3d reconstruction and camera motion estimation, namely stereo disparity, optical flow, and sparse point feature matching. these are evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively and results show a positive effect of our specular inpainting method on these tasks in a novel comprehensive analysis. our code and dataset are made available at https://github.com/endomapper/endo-sttn.",AB_0438
"crop pangenomes made from individual cultivar assemblies promise easy access to conserved genes, but genome content variability and inconsistent identifiers hamper their exploration. to address this, we define pangenes, which summarize a species coding potential and link back to original annotations. the protocol get_pangenes performs whole genome alignments (wga) to call syntenic gene models based on coordinate overlaps. a benchmark with small and large plant genomes shows that pangenes recapitulate phylogeny-based orthologies and produce complete soft-core gene sets. moreover, wgas support lift-over and help confirm gene presence-absence variation. source code and documentation: https://github.com/ensembl/plant-scripts.",AB_0438
"background: self-administration of investigational intranasal l-type calcium channel blocker etripamil during paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (psvt) appeared safe and well-tolerated in the phase 3 node-301 (multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy, and safety study of etripamil nasal spray for the termination of spontaneous episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia) trial of adults with sustained atrioventricular nodal-dependent psvt. the node-302 open-label extension further characterized etripamil safety and efficacy. methods and results: eligible patients were monitored via self-applied cardiac monitoring system for 5 hours after etripamil self-administration. the primary end point was time-to-conversion of positively adjudicated psvt to sinus rhythm after etripamil treatment. probability of conversion to sinus rhythm was reported via kaplan-meier plot. adverse events were based on self-reported symptoms and clinical evaluations. among 169 patients enrolled, 105 self-administered etripamil >= 1 time for perceived psvt (median [range], 232 [8-584] days' follow-up). probability of conversion within 30minutes of etripamil was 60.2% (median time to conversion, 15.5 minutes) among 188 psvt episodes (92 patients) positively adjudicated as atrioventricular nodal dependent by independent ecg analysis. among 40 patients who self-treated 2 episodes, 75% had a significantly consistent response by 30minutes; 9 did not convert on either episode, and 21 converted on both episodes (chi(2)=8.09; p=0.0045). forty-five of 105 patients (42.9%) had >= 1 treatment-emergent adverse event, generally transient and mild-to-moderate, including nasal congestion (14.3%), nasal discomfort (14.3%), or rhinorrhea (12.4%). no serious cardiac safety events were observed within 24 hours of etripamil. conclusions: in this extension study, investigational etripamil nasal spray was well tolerated for self-treating recurrent episodes of psvt without medical supervision. registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct03635996.",AB_0438
"background: despite optimized risk factor control, people with prior cardiovascular disease remain at high cardiovascular disease risk. we assess the immediate-and longer-term impacts of new vascular and nonvascular events on quality of life (qol) and hospital costs among participants in the reveal (randomized evaluation of the effects of anacetrapib through lipid modification) trial in secondary prevention. methods and results: data on demographic and clinical characteristics, health-related quality of life (qol: euroqol 5-dimension-5-level), adverse events, and hospital admissions during the 4-year follow-up of the 21 820 participants recruited in europe and north america informed assessments of the impacts of new adverse events on qol and hospital costs from the uk and us health systems' perspectives using generalized linear regression models. reductions in qol were estimated in the years of event occurrence for nonhemorrhagic stroke (-0.067 [united kingdom], -0.069 [us]), heart failure admission (-0.072 [united kingdom], -0.103 [us]), incident cancer (-0.064 [united kingdom], -0.068 [us]), and noncoronary revascularization (-0.071 [united kingdom], -0.061 [us]), as well as in subsequent years following these events. myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization (crv) procedures were not found to affect qol. all adverse events were associated with additional hospital costs in the years of events and in subsequent years, with the highest additional costs in the years of noncoronary revascularization (5830 pound [united kingdom], $14 133 [us medicare]), of myocardial infarction with urgent crv procedure (5614 pound, $24722), and of urgent/nonurgent crv procedure without myocardial infarction (4674 pound/4651 pound and $15 251/$17 539). conclusions: stroke, heart failure, and noncoronary revascularization procedures substantially reduce qol, and all cardiovascular disease events increase hospital costs. these estimates are useful in informing cost-effectiveness of interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in secondary prevention. registration: url: https://www.clini caltr ials.gov; unique identifier: nct01252953; https://www.isrctn.com. unique identifier: isrctn48678192; https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu. unique identifier: 2010-023467-18.",AB_0438
"confidentiality, integrity protection, and high availability, abbreviated to cia, are essential properties for trustworthy data systems. the rise of cloud computing and the growing demand for multiparty applications however means that building modern cia systems is more challenging than ever. in response, we present the confidential consortium framework (ccf), a general-purpose foundation for developing secure stateful cia applications. ccf combines centralized compute with decentralized trust, supporting deployment on untrusted cloud infrastructure and transparent governance by mutually untrusted parties. ccf leverages hardware-based trusted execution environments for remotely verifiable confidentiality and code integrity. this is coupled with state machine replication backed by an auditable immutable ledger for data integrity and high availability. ccf enables each service to bring its own application logic, custom multiparty governance model, and deployment scenario, decoupling the operators of nodes from the consortium that governs them. ccf is open-source and available now at https://github.com/microsoft/ccf.",AB_0438
"most bacteria live attached to surfaces in densely-packed communities. while new experimental and imaging techniques are beginning to provide a window on the complex processes that play out in these communities, resolving the behaviour of individual cells through time and space remains a major challenge. although a number of different software solutions have been developed to track microorganisms, these typically require users either to tune a large number of parameters or to groundtruth a large volume of imaging data to train a deep learning model-both manual processes which can be very time consuming for novel experiments. to overcome these limitations, we have developed fast, the feature-assisted segmenter/tracker, which uses unsupervised machine learning to optimise tracking while maintaining ease of use. our approach, rooted in information theory, largely eliminates the need for users to iteratively adjust parameters manually and make qualitative assessments of the resulting cell trajectories. instead, fast measures multiple distinguishing 'features' for each cell and then autonomously quantifies the amount of unique information each feature provides. we then use these measurements to determine how data from different features should be combined to minimize tracking errors. comparing our algorithm with a naive approach that uses cell position alone revealed that fast produced 4 to 10 times fewer tracking errors. the modular design of fast combines our novel tracking method with tools for segmentation, extensive data visualisation, lineage assignment, and manual track correction. it is also highly extensible, allowing users to extract custom information from images and seamlessly integrate it into downstream analyses. fast therefore enables high-throughput, data-rich analyses with minimal user input. it has been released for use either in matlab or as a compiled stand-alone application, and is available at https://bit.ly/3vovdhn, along with extensive tutorials and detailed documentation. much of what we know about bacterial behaviour comes from tracking solitary cells through space and time. for example, one can unpick the mechanisms that drive chemotaxis by quantifying the movement of individual microbes as they respond to a nutrient source. however, in infections, industrial processes and the environment, bacteria usually live in tightly-packed communities where they display unique behaviours not observed in solitary cells, such as the activation of contact-dependent weapons to kill their neighbours. tracking individuals in these dense assemblages is technically challenging because it is difficult to follow cells using only their position in each frame. here we present a new software tool called fast which combines machine learning and information theory to optimise cell tracking. our approach uses a range of different cell characteristics such as shape and fluorescent intensity to better distinguish individuals over time, reducing errors up to 10-fold compared to traditional approaches. in addition, fast estimates how tracking accuracy changes over time, alerting users to potential problems such as out of focus frames. by tracking cells in a diverse range of conditions with minimal user input, fast provides a new quantitative platform to study how bacteria have adapted to live in groups.",AB_0438
"a key challenge for emotion recognition in conversations (erc) is to distinguish semantically similar emotions. some works utilise supervised contrastive learning (scl) which uses categorical emotion labels as supervision signals and contrasts in high-dimensional semantic space. however, categorical labels fail to provide quantitative information between emotions. erc is also not equally dependent on all embedded features in the semantic space, which makes the high-dimensional scl inefficient. to address these issues, we propose a novel low-dimensional supervised cluster-level contrastive learning (sccl) method, which first reduces the high-dimensional scl space to a three-dimensional affect representation space valence-arousal-dominance (vad), then performs cluster-level contrastive learning to incorporate measurable emotion prototypes. to help modelling the dialogue and enriching the context, we leverage the pre-trained knowledge adapters to infuse linguistic and factual knowledge. experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art results with 69.81% on iemocap, 65.7% on meld, and 62.51% on dailydialog datasets. the analysis also proves that the vad space is not only suitable for erc but also interpretable, with vad prototypes enhancing its performance and stabilising the training of sccl. in addition, the pre-trained knowledge adapters benefit the performance of the utterance encoder and sccl. our code is available at: https://github.com/stevekgyang/sccli",AB_0438
"solitary rugose corals assigned to streptelasma rutkae n. sp. and an annulated orthoconic cephalopod identified as gorbyoceras sp. occur in nearshore shallow-marine sandstone of the whirlpool formation in hamilton, southern ontario. they are the first macrofossils contributing to a modern understanding of the age and correlation of this stratigraphic unit. streptelasma rutkae most closely resembles s. subregulare (savage, 1913), which occurs widely in the edgewood province of the east-central united states, in strata considered latest ordovician (hirnantian). gorbyoceras ranges into the latest katian (latest richmondian) in the cincinnati arch region. thus, the occurrences of s. rutkae and gorbyoceras sp. support other biostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic data suggesting that the whirlpool formation is latest ordovician, rather than earliest silurian as traditionally thought. they also indicate paleogeographic connections between the area of whirlpool deposition in ontario and the edgewood province and cincinnati arch region in the east-central united statesuuid: http://zoobank.org/d1ded814-204d-4070-a469-52d3b6e259c7",AB_0438
"many recently proposed structure-based virtual screening models appear to be able to accurately distinguish high affinity binders from non-binders. however, several recent studies have shown that they often do so by exploiting ligand-specific biases in the dataset, rather than identifying favourable intermolecular interactions in the input protein-ligand complex. in this work we propose a novel approach for assessing the extent to which machine learning-based virtual screening models are able to identify the functional groups responsible for binding. to sidestep the difficulty in establishing the ground truth importance of each atom of a large scale set of protein-ligand complexes, we propose a protocol for generating synthetic data. each ligand in the dataset is surrounded by a randomly sampled point cloud of pharmacophores, and the label assigned to the synthetic protein-ligand complex is determined by a 3-dimensional deterministic binding rule. this allows us to precisely quantify the ground truth importance of each atom and compare it to the model generated attributions. using our generated datasets, we demonstrate that a recently proposed deep learning-based virtual screening model, pointvs, identified the most important functional groups with 39% more efficiency than a fingerprint-based random forest, suggesting that it would generalise more effectively to new examples. in addition, we found that ligand-specific biases, such as those present in widely used virtual screening datasets, substantially impaired the ability of all ml models to identify the most important functional groups. we have made our synthetic data generation framework available to facilitate the benchmarking of new virtual screening models. code is available at https://github.com/tomhadfield95/synthvs.",AB_0438
