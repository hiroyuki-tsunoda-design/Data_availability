"a new genus and new species of freshwater crab, vichai cyanapelou gen. et sp. nov., is described from the forested sava region of northern madagascar based on morphology and previously obtained molecular data. the new genus superficially resembles several other deckeniid genera from madagascar. a combination of characters in the carapace, mandible, cheliped, thoracic sternum, third maxilliped and male first gonopod, however, distinguish it from confamilials. previous phylogenetic analysis using the cytochrome oxidase subunit i (coi) gene also supports the new monotypic genus and new species and shows that it forms a distinct clade separate from the 12 other malagasy genera. vichai cyanalepou sp. nov. is endemic to madagascar and is here compared to other species and genera of freshwater crabs occurring in that country. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:46218584-43fe-4c05-9537-ffc81eaccfdb http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:b5985969-b677-47e4be59-37c1308b7a66",AB_0564
"we present an improved algorit h m to solve the near-congruence problem for rigid molecules and clusters based on the iterative application of assignment and alignment steps with biased euclidean costs. the algorithm is formulated as a quasi-local optimization procedure with each optimization step involving a linear assignment (lap) and a singular value decomposition (svd). the efficiency of the algorithm is increased by up to 5 orders of magnitude with respect to the original unbiased nonitera t i v e method and can be applied to systems with hundreds or thousands of atoms, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods published so far in the literature. the fortran implementation of the algorithm is available as an open source library (https://github.com/qcuaeh/molalignlib) and is suitable to be used in global optimization methods for the identification of local minima or basins.",AB_0564
"quantitative analysis on biomedical images has been on increasing demand nowadays and for modern computer vision approaches. while recently advanced procedures have been enforced, there is still necessity in optimizing network architecture and loss functions. inspired by the pretrained efficientnet-b4 and the refinement module in boundary-aware problems, we propose a new two-stage network which is called effcientnet-encoder u-net joint residual refinement module and we create a novel loss function called the tversky-kahneman baroni-urbani-buser loss function. the loss function is built on the basement of the baroni-urbani-buser coefficient and the jaccard-tanimoto coefficient and reformulated in the tversky- kahneman probability-weighting function. we have evaluated our algorithm on the four popular datasets: the 2018 data science bowl cell nucleus segmentation dataset, the brain tumor lgg segmentation dataset, the skin lesion isic 2018 dataset and the mri cardiac acdc dataset. several comparisons have proved that our proposed approach is noticeably promising and some of the segmentation results provide new state-of-the-art results. the code is available at https://github.com/tswizzle141/an-effcientnet-encoder-u-net-joint-residual-refinement-module-with-tk-bub-loss.",AB_0564
"cancer genomics tailors diagnosis and treatment based on an individual's genetic information and is the crux of precision medicine. however, analysis and maintenance of high volume of genetic mutation data to build a machine learning (ml) model to predict the cancer type is a computationally expensive task and is often outsourced to powerful cloud servers, raising critical privacy concerns for patients' data. homomorphic encryption (he) enables computation on encrypted data, thus, providing cryptographic guarantees to protect privacy. but restrictive overheads of encrypted computation deter its usage. in this work, we explore the challenges of privacy preserving cancer type prediction using a dataset consisting of more than 2 million genetic mutations from 2713 patients for several cancer types by building a highly accurate ml model and then implementing its privacy preserving version in he. our solution for cancer type inference encodes somatic mutations based on their impact on the cancer genomes into the feature space and then uses statistical tests for feature selection. we propose a fast matrix multiplication algorithm for he-based model. our final model achieves 0.98 micro-average area under curve improving accuracy from 70.08 to 83.61% , being 550 times faster than the standard matrix multiplication-based privacy-preserving models. our tool can be found at https:// github. com/ momal ab/ octal-candet.",AB_0564
"the sars-cov-2 pandemic highlighted the need for software tools that could facilitate patient triage regarding potential disease severity or even death. in this article, an ensemble of machine learning (ml) algorithms is evaluated in terms of predicting the severity of their condition using plasma proteomics and clinical data as input. an overview of ai-based technical developments to support covid-19 patient management is presented outlining the landscape of relevant technical developments. based on this review, the use of an ensemble of ml algorithms that analyze clinical and biological data (i.e., plasma proteomics) of covid-19 patients is designed and deployed to evaluate the potential use of ai for early covid-19 patient triage. the proposed pipeline is evaluated using three publicly available datasets for training and testing. three ml tasks are defined, and several algorithms are tested through a hyperparameter tuning method to identify the highest-performance models. as overfitting is one of the typical pitfalls for such approaches (mainly due to the size of the training/validation datasets), a variety of evaluation metrics are used to mitigate this risk. in the evaluation procedure, recall scores ranged from 0.6 to 0.74 and f1-score from 0.62 to 0.75. the best performance is observed via multi-layer perceptron (mlp) and support vector machines (svm) algorithms. additionally, input data (proteomics and clinical data) were ranked based on corresponding shapley additive explanation (shap) values and evaluated for their prognosticated capacity and immuno-biological credence. this interpretable approach revealed that our ml models could discern critical covid-19 cases predominantly based on patient's age and plasma proteins on b cell dysfunction, hyper-activation of inflammatory pathways like toll-like receptors, and hypo-activation of developmental and immune pathways like scf/c-kit signaling. finally, the herein computational workflow is corroborated in an independent dataset and mlp superiority along with the implication of the abovementioned predictive biological pathways are corroborated. regarding limitations of the presented ml pipeline, the datasets used in this study contain less than 1000 observations and a significant number of input features hence constituting a high-dimensional low-sample (hdls) dataset which could be sensitive to overfitting. an advantage of the proposed pipeline is that it combines biological data (plasma proteomics) with clinical-phenotypic data. thus, in principle, the presented approach could enable patient triage in a timely fashion if used on already trained models. however, larger datasets and further systematic validation are needed to confirm the potential clinical value of this approach. the code is available on github: https://github.com/inab-certh/predicting-covid-19-severity-through-interpretable-ai-analysis -of-plasma-proteomics.",AB_0564
"objective: infectious diseases (ids) pose a heavy burden on children. an association between pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) and specific ids has been documented. our objective was to test the possibility that adhd is associated with increased likelihood for pediatric ids at large.method: a population-based case-control study was conducted using electronic medical records (emrs) of a national health maintenance or-ganization, leumit health services (lhs). icd-9/10 criteria were used for all diagnoses. the study population consisted of all children and adolescents (aged 5-18 years), members of lhs between january 1, 2006-june 30, 2021. case patients met international classification of diseases (icd-9/10) criteria for adhd. controls included randomly selected persons without adhd (2:1 ratio), matched individually by demographic indices. the emrs retrieved 3 exposure categories: pediatric id, anti-infective medications use, and number of physician visits. the study was approved by the review board of shamir medical center and the research committee of lhs.results: cases patients comprised 18,756 participants, with a mean age of 8.3 + 2.6 years and a male/female ratio of 63%:37%. matched controls comprised 37,512 participants, with a mean age of 8.3 + 2.6 years and a male/female ratio of 63%:37%. demographic variables were similar between the groups. the rates of all ids were significantly higher in participants with adhd than in controls and were not restricted to a single body system, including acute respiratory infection (or = 1.4, 95% ci = 1.3-1.4, p < .001), acute gastroenteritis (or = 1.3,95% ci 1.3-1.4, p < .001), salmonellosis (or = 2.8, 95% ci = 2.3-3.5, p < .001), and urinary tract infection (or = 1.3, 95% ci = 1.2-1.4, p < .001). all anti-infective agents were prescribed significantly more often to children with adhd. there were significantly higher rates of physician visits for participants with adhd.conclusion: study findings suggest an association between id and pediatric adhd health care providers should be aware of this potential association.clinical trial registration information: the health and economic impact of treated and untreated adhd; https://www.shamir.org/; 005-18-leu.",AB_0564
"this research will use the self-developed periodic table of ladder board game as a formative evaluation using the 5e learning model. the board game is like the snake and ladder game. in the 5e model, the board game is the formative assessment part of the evaluation phase. the formative assessment is a group of questions set in the question cards. the colors of the question cards relate to the position of elements in the periodic table. students will have to answer questions regarding the role of one traditional dice when they land on group 1 (green), group 17 (brown), group 18 (purple), and the transition elements (blue). the questions cover the physical and chemical properties of group 1, group 17, and group 18. besides that, it covers the elements' reactivity, characteristics, special characteristics of transition elements, and molar mass calculation based on the malaysian chemistry syllabus (http://bpk.moe.gov.my/, 2022). moving game pieces from the starting point (hydrogen) to the end point (oganisson) helps students understand the arrangement of elements in the periodic table according to the increase of the atomic number. this game received positive feedback from 24 year 11 students in a secondary school regarding the intention to use the game, perceived learning effectiveness, and satisfaction. additionally, the game received constructive feedback during a road show for the innovative design of educational games.",AB_0564
"high-throughput sequencing of adaptive immune receptor repertoires is a valuable tool for receiving insights in adaptive immunity studies. several powerful tcr/bcr repertoire reconstruction and analysis methods have been developed in the past decade. however, detecting and correcting the discrepancy between real and experimentally observed lymphocyte clone frequencies are still challenging. here, we discovered a hallmark anomaly in the ratio between read count and clone count -based frequencies of non-functional clonotypes in multiplex pcr- based immune repertoires. calculating this anomaly, we formulated a quantitative measure of v-and j -genes frequency bias driven by multiplex pcr during library preparation called over amplification rate (oar). based on the oar concept, we developed an original software for multiplex pcr-specific bias evaluation and correction named iroar: immune repertoire over amplification removal (https://github.com/smiranast/iroar). the iroar algorithm was successfully tested on previously published tcr repertoires obtained using both 5' race (rapid amplification of cdna ends) -based and multiplex pcr- based approaches and compared with a biological spike -in -based method for pcr bias evaluation. the developed approach can increase the accuracy and consistency of repertoires reconstructed by different methods making them more applicable for comparative analysis.",AB_0564
"the arseny program is intended to compute cross-sections of inelastic transitions via hidden crossings upon slow one-electron atomic ion-ion collisions using the approximation of classical description of nuclear motion in the collision energy region e < 20 kev/nucleon. particular attention is paid to the calculation of the analytical properties of adiabatic potential energy curves of the two-center coulomb problem for complex values of the internuclear distance. complex branch points and hidden crossings are calculated and their significance for the dynamics of one-electron collisional systems is revealed. benchmark calculations of cross sections for charge exchange, excitation, and ionization in slow he2++h(1s) collisions are presented and compared with experimental data. program summaryprogram title: arsenycpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /n43srxwdnm .1licensing provisions: cc by 4.0programming language: fortran 90/95. compilers: intel(r) visual fortran compiler 19.0.4.245 [ia-32] nature of problem: the processes of charge exchange, excitation, and ionization in one-electron atomic ion-ion collisions in a low-temperature plasma are actively studied in astrophysics and tokamak chargeexchange recombination spectroscopy (cxrs) edge diagnostics in iter [1-7]. numerical calculations of cross sections for charge exchange, excitation, and ionization for slow one-electron atomic ion-ion collisions within the approximation of classical description of nuclear motion have been conventionally implemented, in particular, by the electron-nuclear dynamics approach [8] and the close-coupled channel method using basis functions of the two-center coulomb problem (see, e.g., [9-13]). however, with real-valued internuclear distance these approaches did not allow for the dynamical structure of discrete discrete and discrete-continuous transitions in the two-center coulomb problem. this disadvantage manifests itself in the disagreement between the theoretical and experimental cross-sections at small velocity of ions [13-15]. in a number of papers [1,14,16-20] the dynamical structure of the transitions is considered in terms of hidden crossing of potential curves, when using the analytic continuation to a complex plane of the internuclear distance. this approach is implemented in the arseny program aimed at computing cross sections of inelastic discrete-discrete and discrete-continuous transitions via hidden crossings for slow one-electron atomic ion-ion collisions within the approximation of classical description of nuclear motion announced in [1]. benchmark calculations of cross sections for charge exchange, excitation, and ionization in slow he2++h(1s) collisions are presented and compared with experimental data.solution method: the potential energy curves e = e(r) and the separation constant & lambda; = & lambda;(r) depending on the real-valued and complex-valued parameter r of the two-center coulomb problem are calculated from the minimization condition for a quadratic functional corresponding to a pair of nonlinear equations with respect to a pair of unknowns e(r) and & lambda;(r) by iterating three-term recurrent relations [21,22] using a mean least square method [23]. these equations are obtained from the known recurrent relations for the expansion coefficients of quasiradial and quasiangular spheroidal coulomb functions. the series of branching points rc sought for in the complex plane of internuclear distance r and the hidden crossings of complex potential energy curves e(r) are calculated by an iterative method using the known analytical behavior in the form of a square root of difference e(r) - e(rc) in the vicinity of the unknown branch points rc. calculations of cross-sections of inelastic transitions via hidden crossings for the slow one electron atomic ion-ion collisions within the approximation of classical description of nuclear motion are carried out by integration over the impact parameter of the nonadiabatic transition probability expressed in terms of the stuckelberg parameter determined integral of difference of imaginary parts of each pair of complex potential energy curves e(r) by a contour around the branching point rc [18,19].additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: in calculations of cross sections and required branch points, about 220 adiabatic states of the lower part of the discrete spectrum of the two-center problem are used.",AB_0564
"the fusion of multiple preference lists into a single aggregate list with improved element ranking is a well-studied research area with numerous applications in bioinformatics, information retrieval, collaborative filtering, and election systems. despite the existence of a large number of rank ag-gregation methods, only a small portion of them have publicly available implementations. in this paper we introduce flagr, a high performance, modular, open source library for rank aggregation. the library contains efficient implementations of both baseline and state-of-the-art algorithms that receive multiple ranked preference lists and output a single consensus ranking. we also introduce pyflagr, a library that links to the flagr core and allows the invocation of its implementations from standard python programs. the package also includes a special tool that can be used to evaluate and compare the performance of the underlying algorithms. in contrast to other solutions, flagr has been created with flexibility in mind: third-party researchers and analysts may easily integrate their implementations into the library by developing only a single function. these features render flagr and pyflagr an attractive research platform for developing, comparing and evaluating rank aggregation algorithms. extended descriptions of the library components and useful code examples are provided in the accompanying user manual (provided as supplemental material) and the supporting web site at https://flagr.site.(c) 2023 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0564
