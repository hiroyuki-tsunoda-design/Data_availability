"infrared and visible image fusion aims to produce fused images which retain rich texture details and high pixel intensity in the source images. in this article, we propose a dual-attention-based feature aggregation network for infrared and visible image fusion. specifically, we first design a multibranch channel-attention-based feature aggregation block (mbca) by generating multiple branches to suppress useless features from different aspects. this block is also able to adaptively aggregate the meaningful features by exploiting the interdependencies between channel features. to gather more meaningful features during the fusion process, we further design a global-local spatial-attention-based feature aggregation block (glsa), for progressively integrating features of source images. after that, we introduce multiscale structural similarity (ms-ssim) as loss function to evaluate the structural differences between the fused image and the source images from multiple scales. in addition, the proposed network involves strong generalization ability since our fusion model is trained on the roadscene dataset and tested directly on the tno and msrs datasets. extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the superiority of our network compared with the current state-of-the-art methods. the source code will be released at https://github.com/tangjunyang/dualattention.",AB_0205
"the quality of sequence frames is the premise of obtaining accurate vibration curves by visual vibration measurement method. existing methods for video super-resolution reconstruction (vsr) have large models and slow inference speeds, which are not suitable for practical industrial applications. this article proposes a video super-resolution network framework based on the pyramid and deformable convolution to measure the three key indicators of algorithm accuracy, speed, and model size. specifically, we designed a pyramid alignment module (pam) that includes a deformable self-attention module (dsa) to focus on the motion estimation of the region of interest while suppressing unrealistic motion estimation. in addition, the two-way propagation method combined with the pam can be used to ensure that all frames in the input sequence can be balanced to enjoy the information of the full sequence of frames when aligned. the experimental results show that the proposed method improves the peak signal-to-noise ratio (psnr) by 0.58 db compared with the existing reconstruction algorithm on the high-speed rotor image dataset produced in this article and reduces the reasoning time by 41.5% and the model size by 9.1%. finally, the rotor vibration displacement analysis experiment shows that the vibration signal obtained from the rotor data enhanced by this algorithm has better periodicity and stability. our code will be available at https://github.com/candygogogogo/rotor-sequence-image-enhancement.",AB_0205
"bearing fault diagnosis is of great importance to decrease the damage risk of rotating machines and further improve economic profits. recently, machine learning, represented by deep learning, has made great progress in bearing fault diagnosis. however, applying deep learning to such a task still faces major challenges such as effectiveness and interpretability: 1) when bearing signals are highly corrupted by noise, the performance of deep learning models drops dramatically and 2) a deep network is notoriously a black box. it is difficult to know how a model classifies faulty signals from the normal and the physics principle behind the classification. to solve these issues, first, we prototype a convolutional network with recently invented quadratic neurons. this quadratic neuron-empowered network can qualify the noisy bearing data due to the strong feature representation ability of quadratic neurons. moreover, we independently derive the attention mechanism from a quadratic neuron, referred to as qttention, by factorizing the learned quadratic function in analog to the attention, making the model made of quadratic neurons inherently interpretable. experiments on the public and our datasets demonstrate that the proposed network can facilitate effective and interpretable bearing fault diagnosis. our code is available at https://github.com/asdvfghg/qcnn_for_bearing_diagnosis.",AB_0205
"purpose: we compared the microbial communities of the eye, anterior nares (ans) and oropharynx (op) of healthy adults to provide a basic understanding of the microbial associations among the three sites. methods: the name of the registry of our prospective study was study on the diversity of microbial flora in the eye, nose and oro-pharynx of healthy people. the trial number is chictr2300067724 (https://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx). swabs were collected from the eye, ans and op of 48 healthy adult participants for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing. the bacterial community profiles and their functional associations were compared among the three sites. results: at a phylum level, the basic bacterial compositions in the eye and ans were generally similar, and the predominant phyla were actinobacteria, proteobacteria and firmicutes. in contrast, the op microbiota was characterized by an increased abundance of bacteroidetes. at a genus level, corynebacterium, cutibacterium and staphylococcus were the most abundant in the eye and ans. prevotella-7, alloprevatella, haemophilus and streptococcus were more abundant in the op. correlation analysis of the eye and ans microbiota suggested that cutibacterium and micrococcus may migrate from the eye to nose (p < 0.05). conclusions: the bacterial flora composition and function predictions of eye and ans were similar, but differed from those of the op in healthy adults. the op bacterial flora distribution was markedly different, showing characteristics similar to that of the digestive tract flora. thus, the eye and ans microorganisms may be related in healthy individuals. cutibacterium and micrococcus may migrate from the eye to the nose.",AB_0205
"surface defect detection is an important part of the steel production process. recently, attention mechanisms have been widely used in steel surface defect detection to ensure product quality. the existing attention modules cannot distinguish the difference between steel surface images and natural images. therefore, we propose an adaptive graph channel attention (agca) module, which introduces graph convolutional theory into channel attention. the agca module takes each channel as a feature vertex, and their relationship is represented by an adjacency matrix. we perform non-local (nl) operations on features by analyzing graphs constructed in agca. the operation significantly improves the feature representation capability. similar to other attention modules, the agca module has lightweight and plug-and-play characteristics. it enables the module easily embedded into defect detection networks. the experimental results on various backbone networks and datasets show that the agca outperforms state-of-the-art methods. code is available at https://github.com/c1nderainbo0m/agca.",AB_0205
"recent feature descriptor research has witnessed tremendous progress with the development of the deep neural network. however, most existing descriptors solely focus on learning strong discriminativeness with deep-invariant features, neglecting their representation ability and rich hierarchical clues hidden in images, which could further establish high-quality matches via implicit hierarchical comparisons in rich representative descriptor space. in this article, we consider both the discriminative and representation ability of feature descriptors to enrich the descriptor space with a novel representative learning framework. on the one hand, we introduce histogram of oriented gradient (hog) as a prior term to guide our descriptor to learn a powerful representation and robustness in a self-supervised manner. on the other hand, we present an adaptive triplet loss (atl), which penalizes the triplet loss (tl) according to the descriptor matching distances in order to encourage our descriptor to learn strong discriminativeness. moreover, to fully use the information encapsulated in images and boost the representation ability, we propose a novel hierarchical feature transformer network (hift), which derives dense descriptions from the semantic and cross-scale-enhanced hierarchical features in a local-to-global manner. extensive experiments on popular feature matching and visual localization benchmarks show that the hift achieves highly competitive performance compared with the state-of-theart methods. applications on visual measurement tasks of visual 3-d reconstruction and ego-motion estimation also demonstrate the high generalization ability of our method. our model is available at https://github.com/ray2ouc/hift.",AB_0205
"due to the limited perceptual field, convolutional neural networks (cnn) only extract local temporal features and may fail to capture long-term dependencies for eeg decoding. in this paper, we propose a compact convolutional transformer, named eeg conformer, to encapsulate local and global features in a unified eeg classification framework. specifically, the convolution module learns the low-level local features throughout the one-dimensional temporal and spatial convolution layers. the self-attention module is straightforwardly connected to extract the global correlation within the local temporal features. subsequently, the simple classifier module based on fully-connected layers is followed to predict the categories for eeg signals. to enhance interpretability, we also devise a visualization strategy to project the class activation mapping onto the brain topography. finally, we have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our method on three public datasets in eeg-based motor imagery and emotion recognition paradigms. the experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and has great potential to be a new baseline for general eeg decoding. the code has been released in https://github.com/eeyhsong/eeg-conformer.",AB_0205
"strip steel surface defect (s3d) segmentation is a crucial method to inspect the surface quality of strip steel in the producing-and-manufacturing. however, existing s3d semantic segmentation methods depend on quite a few labeled defective samples for training, and generalization to novel defect categories that have not yet been trained is challenging. additionally, some defect categories are incredibly sparse in the industrial production processes. motivated by the above problems, this article proposed a simple but effective few-shot segmentation method named cross position aggregation network (cpanet), which intends to learn a network that can segment untrained s3d categories with only a few labeled defective samples. using a cross-position proxy (cpp) module, our cpanet can effectively aggregate long-range relationships of discrete defects, and support auxiliary (sa) can further improve the feature aggregation capability of cpp. moreover, cpanet introduces a space squeeze attention (ssa) module to aggregate multiscale context information of defect features and suppresses disadvantageous interference from background information. in addition, a novel s3d few-shot semantic segmentation (fss) dataset fssd-12 is proposed to evaluate our cpanet. through extensive comparison experiments and ablation experiments, we explicitly evaluate that our cpanet with the resnet-50 backbone achieves state-of-theart performance on dataset fssd-12. our dataset and code are available at (https://github.com/vdt-2048/cpanet).",AB_0205
"objective: to explore the potential effect of ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block (sgb) on lung protection for patients undergoing one-lung ventilation (olv). methods: a total of 123 patients undergoing elective one-lung ventilation surgery were selected as research subjects in this prospective study. these patients were randomly divided into the sgb group, control group and blank group on average. stellate ganglion block was carried out in the sgb and control groups. patients in the sgb group were injected with 6 ml mixture of 0.25% ropivacaine hydrochloride and 1% lidocaine hydrochloride, while those in the control group were injected with 6 ml of 0.9% sa-line. punctures weren't performed for patients in the blank group. the same induction and maintenance of general anesthesia was adopted for all three groups. hemodynamics, respiratory parameters and arterial blood gas analysis were recorded after entering the operation room (t0), pre-olv (t1), 30 min after olv (t2), 60 min after olv (t3), at the end of surgery (t4), and 30 min after extubation (t5). oxygenation index (oi), pulmonary shunt fraction (qs/ qt) and ph value were compared at different time points. intravenous serum was collected at t0, t3 and t5 for the detection of surfactant proteins a (sp-a), superoxide dismutase (sod), malondialdehyde (mda), interleukin-6 (il-6) and interleukin-10 (il-10) levels, respectively. the complications related to sgb after surgery and the postoperative pulmonary complications within 72 h were recorded. results: at t1, t2, and t3, map level in sgb group was lower than that in blank and control groups (p < 0.05). at t2, and t3, sgb group had lower hear rate (hr), peak airway pressure (p-peak) and tidal volume (tv) than blank and control groups (all p < 0.05). from t2 to t5, sgb group had higher oi but lower qs/qt than blank and control groups (both p < 0.05). at t3 and t5, sgb group had lower sp-a, il-6, and mda levels but higher il-10 and sod levels than blank and control groups (all p < 0.05). there was one case of hypoxemia in the blank group within 72 h after surgery. conclusion: ultrasound-guided sgb has lung-protective effects on patients undergoing olv, which significantly improves patients' oi, reduces intrapulmonary shunts, de-clines ventilator-induced lung damage, and inhibits inflammatory response as well as oxidative stress (china clinical trial registry, registration number chictr2100053449, https://www.chictr.org.cn).",AB_0205
"background: alcohol dependence has become a major problem that poses a serious threat to public health. long-term heavy alcohol consumption can lead to brain functional disorders. this study aimed to investigate the relationship of the severity of cerebral white matter lesions (wmls), serum neurofilament light (nfl) and inflammatory factors, tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), with the cognitive function of patients with alcohol dependence. methods: a total of 118 patients were enrolled in this prospective study, and divided into alcohol-dependent and non-alcohol-dependent groups. the severity of wmls was assessed using the fazekas scale based on magnetic resonance imaging analysis. the expression levels of nfl, tnf-alpha and il-1 beta in the serum of the subjects were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the cognitive function and psychological status of the patients were assessed using the minimum mental state examination (mmse), montreal cognitive assessment (moca), hamilton depression rating scale (hamd) and hamilton anxiety rating scale (hama). the severity of wmls and the expression levels of serum nfl, tnf-alpha and il-1 beta in alcohol-dependent patients were analysed for their influence on cognitive function. this clinical trial was approved by china clinical trials registry, and the trial number is chictr2200066057 (http://www.chictr.org.cn/searchproj.aspx). results: the score of fazekas scale was higher, and the mmse score and moca score were lower in the alcohol-dependent group than those in the non-alcohol-dependent group. moreover, the fazekas score of the alcohol-dependent group was negatively correlated with the mmse and moca scores. the serum nfl, tnf-alpha and il-1 beta levels were higher in the alcohol-dependent group than in the non-alcohol-dependent group, and the serum nfl, tnf-alpha and il-1 beta levels in the alcohol-dependent group were negatively correlated with the mmse and moca scores. conclusion: alcohol-dependent patients have more severe cerebral wmls and significant cognitive impairment, particularly in visuospatial and executive functions, attention, calculation, abstraction, delayed recall and orientation. serum nfl, tnf-alpha and il-1 beta may be used as biomarkers to assess alcohol related cognitive decline.",AB_0205
