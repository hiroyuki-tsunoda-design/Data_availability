"in many modern bioinformatics applications, such as statistical genetics, or single-cell analysis, one frequently encounters datasets which are orders of magnitude too large for conventional in-memory analysis. to tackle this challenge, we introduce simbsig (simmilarity batched search integrated gpu), a highly scalable python package which provides a scikit-learn-like interface for out-of-core, gpu-enabled similarity searches, principal component analysis and clustering. due to the pytorch backend, it is highly modular and particularly tailored to many data types with a particular focus on biobank data analysis. availability and implementation: simbsig is freely available from pypi and its source code and documentation can be found on github (https://github.com/borgwardtlab/simbsig) under a bsd-3 license. contact: michael.adamer@bsse.ethz.ch",AB_0524
"a new typothoracine aetosaur is described based on multiple isolated and articulated left paramedian and lateral osteoderms recovered from the upper triassic lower dharmaram formation of india. the partial carapace of the new taxon is reconstructed as strongly discoidal based on the curvature of the paramedian osteoderms with the widest one positioned dorsal to the mid-dorsal trunk vertebra. asymmetric lateral osteoderms with acute flexion are considered as precaudals with the angle of flexion decreasing posteriorly. phylogenetic analysis recovered the new taxon as deeply nested within the clades typothoracinae and paratypothoracini, and a sister taxon to kocurypelta silvestris. the autapomorphic characters involving paramedian osteoderms dorsal to the trunk vertebrae include dorsal surface ornamented by large, irregular pits surrounding the dorsal eminence and radiating ridges in other areas, straight anterior margin of the anteromedial corner of the anterior bar in dorsal view, and raised or ridged and ornamented posteromedial corner. the current study highlights the significance of the new aetosaur, and the age of the lower dharamaram formation is modified here as mid-norian to rhaetian based on global correlation with other coeval horizons. the recovery of this taxon marks the first record of paratypothoracini from high paleolatitudes of the gondwanan region. the study corroborates the earlier findings of a strong laurasian faunal influx in india during the late triassic suggesting possible land bridges and/or conducive environmental conditions for faunal dispersal.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:fcc37c0e-107f-4b15-9460-4e802b465865",AB_0524
"background: poor medication adherence or inaccuracy in taking prescribed medications plays an important role in the recurrence or worsening of psychiatric symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, and the covid-19 pandemic impacted their medication adherence with exacerbated symptoms or relapse. the use of mobile health services increased during the covid-19 pandemic, and their role in improving mental health is becoming clearer.objective: this study aimed to explore the effectiveness of a smartphone app (medadhere) on medication adherence and accuracy among patients with schizophrenia and to measure their psychiatric symptoms and cognitive functions.methods: in this 12-week experimental study, participants were provided interventions with the medadhere app, and data were collected between june 2021 and september 2022. a total of 105 participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control groups. we used the positive and negative syndrome scale and mini-mental state examination to measure the participants' psychiatric symptoms and cognitive functions. generalized estimating equations were used for data analysis.results: a total of 94 participants met the inclusion criteria and completed the protocol, and the medication adherence rate of the experimental group was 94.72% (2785/2940) during the intervention. psychotic symptoms (positive, negative, and general psychopathology symptoms) and cognitive functions (memory, language, and executive function) were significantly improved in the experimental group compared to the control group after the intervention.conclusions: the medadhere app effectively and significantly improved medication adherence and, thereby, the psychiatric symptoms of patients with schizophrenia. this artificial intelligence assisted app could be extended to all patients who need to be reminded to take medication on schedule.trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct05892120; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/nct05892120(jmir ment health 2023;10:e50806) doi: 10.2196/50806",AB_0524
"in this paper, we study lightweight age estimation methods based on a coarse-to-fine approach in which the network performs age prediction with multiple stages. in each stage, the network only focuses on refining the coarse age prediction generated from the previous stage. the final age prediction is the combination of all staged prediction values. we observe that these stages have a causal relationship, that is, the output of each stage is highly correlated with outputs of its former stages. thus, each stage should share the information of its previous stage before making a refined prediction. based on this observation, we construct a new compact cnn model called homologous stagewise regression network (hsr-net). in hsr-net, each stage shares the information of the last convolutional layer and then generates its own refined value. in addition, hsr-net also addresses the age group ambiguity problem by utilizing an easy dynamic range construction. in order to enhance the prediction performance of hsr-nets, it is naive to increase the number of kernels in each convolutional layer of hsr-nets. however, the constructed hsr-net has extremely large parameter size. to address this problem, we propose the separable hsr-nets (sephsr-nets) where standard convolutions are replaced by depth-wise separable convolutions in the convolutional layers of hsr-nets. in general, the parameter size of sephsr-nets ranges from 10k to 75k without sacrificing prediction performance. experimental results show that sephsr-nets achieve competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art compact models. our code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/yanjenhuang/hsr-net.",AB_0524
"over the past few years, deep learning techniques have revolutionized the field of face parsing by utilizing massive datasets to generate high-level features and achieve outstanding performance. usually, these techniques involve convolutional neural networks (cnns) to derive features from the input image and then a decoder network to forecast the semantic labels for every pixel. even with complex deep convolutional neural networks (dcnn), incorrect parsing leads to a semantic gap between identical features, especially at boundary levels. face parsing has encountered additional challenges due to the inclusion of pose, illumination and facial expressions. in order to address these issues, a boundary aware dilated attention network (badanet) is introduced which explores the use of multi-scale techniques to improve the accuracy and robustness of the per-pixel frames. badanet's dilated attention module has been combined with a lightweight backbone to achieve exceptional results on lapa, celebamask-hq, and ibugmask. extensive evaluations of the proposed method demonstrate its performance to be on par with various state-of-the-art techniques. the pipeline for the badanet is available at https://github.com/abhigoku10/badanet",AB_0524
"recent advancements in developing pre-trained models using large-scale datasets have emphasized the importance of robust protocols to adapt them effectively to domain-specific data, especially when the available data is limited. to achieve data-efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained object detection models, data augmentations are crucial. however, selecting the appropriate augmentation policy for a given dataset is known to be challenging. in this study, we address an overlooked aspect of this problem - can bounding box annotations be utilized to develop more effective augmentation policies? our approach interaug reveals that, by leveraging the annotations, one can deduce the optimal context for each object in a scene, rather than manipulating the entire scene or just the pre-defined bounding boxes. through rigorous empirical research involving various benchmarks and architectures, we showcase the effectiveness of interaug in enhancing robustness, handling data scarcity, and maintaining resilience to diverse high background contexts. an important advantage of interaug is its compatibility with any off-the-shelf policy, requiring no modifications to the model architecture, and it significantly outperforms existing protocols. we will release the codes upon acceptance. our codes can be found at https://github.com/kowshikthopalli/interaug.",AB_0524
"images corrupted by snowy adverse weather can impose performance impediments to critical high-level vision-based applications. restoring snow-degraded images is vital, but the task is ill-posed and very challenging due to the veiling effect, stochastic distribution, and multi-scale characteristics of snow in a scene. in this regard, many existing image denoising methods are often less successful with respect to snow removal, being that they mostly achieve success with one snow dataset and underperform in others, thus questioning their robustness in tackling real-world complex snowfall scenarios. in this paper, we propose the wavelet in transformer (wit) network to address the image desnow inverse problem. our model exploits the joint systemic capabilities of the vision transformer and the renowned discrete wavelet transform to achieve effective restoration of snow-degraded images. in our experiments, we evaluated the performance of our model on the popular srrs, snow100k, and csd datasets, respectively. the efficacy of our learning-based network is proven by our obtained numeric and qualitative result outcomes indicating significant performance gains compared to image desnow benchmark models and other state-of-the-art methods in the literature. the source code is available at https://github.com/wins-lab/wit.",AB_0524
