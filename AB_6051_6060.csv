"objective: surgery plays a key role in the management of brain metastases. stratifying surgical risk and individualizing treatment will help optimize outcomes because there is clinical equipoise between radiation and resection as treatment options for many patients. here, the authors used a multicenter database to assess the prognostic utility of baseline frailty, calculated with the risk analysis index (rai), for prediction of mortality within 30 days after surgery for brain metastasis. methods: the authors pooled patients who had been surgically treated for brain metastasis from the american college of surgeons national surgical quality improvement program database (2012-2020). the authors studied the relationship between preoperative calculated rai score and 30-day mortality after surgery for brain metastasis by using linear-by-linear proportional trend tests and binary logistic regression. the authors calculated c-statistics (with 95% cis) in receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve analysis to assess discriminative accuracy. results: the authors identified 11,038 patients who underwent brain metastasis resection with a median (interquar- tile range) age of 62 (54-69) years. the authors categorized patients into four groups on the basis of rai: robust (rai 0-20), 8.1% of patients; normal (rai 21-30), 9.2%; frail (rai 31-40), 75%; and severely frail (rai >= 41), 8.1%. the au- thors found a positive correlation between 30-day mortality and frailty. rai demonstrated superior predictive discrimination for 30-day mortality as compared with the 5-factor modified frailty index (mfi-5) on roc analysis (c-statistic 0.65, 95% ci 0.65-0.66). conclusions: the rai frailty score accurately estimates 30-day mortality after brain metastasis resection and can be calculated online with an open-access software tool: https://nsgyfrailtyoutcomeslab.shinyapps.io/brainmetsresection/. accordingly, rai can be utilized to measure surgical risk, guide treatment options, and optimize outcomes for patients with brain metastases. rai has superior discrimination for predicting 30-day mortality compared with mfi-5.",AB_0606
"objective the purpose of this study was to discern factors that differentiate patients who experience postoperative lower-extremity motor function decline in the early postoperative period.methods adult spinal deformity (asd) patients who were enrolled in a multicenter, observational, and prospectively collected study from 2018 to 2021 at 18 spinal deformity centers in north america were queried. eligible participants met at least one of the following radiographic and/or procedural inclusion criteria: pelvic incidence minus lumbar lordosis (pi-ll) z 25 & deg;, t1 pelvic angle (t1pa) z 30 & deg;, sagittal vertical axis (sva) z 15 cm, thoracic scoliosis z 70 & deg;, thoracolumbar scoliosis z 50 & deg;, global coronal malalignment z 7 cm, 3-column osteotomy, spinal fusion z 12 levels, and/or age z 65 years with z 7 levels of instrumentation. patients with an inflammatory or autoimmune disease and those who were incarcerated or pregnant were excluded, as were non-english speakers. only patients with baseline and 6-week postop-erative lower-extremity motor score (lems) were analyzed. patient information, including demographic data, operative data, patient-reported outcomes, and radiographic parameters, were collected. univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were built to quantify the degree to which a patient's postoperative lems decline was related to dem-ographic and clinical characteristics.results in total, 205 patients (mean age 61.5 years, mean total instrumented levels 12.6, 67.3% female, 54.2% pri-mary cases, 79.5% with pelvic fixation) were evaluated. of these 205 patients, 32 (15.5%) experienced lems decline in the perioperative period. these patients were older (p = 0.0014) and had greater bmi (p = 0.0176), higher frailty scores (p = 0.047), longer operating room times (p = 0.033), and greater estimated blood loss (p < 0.0001), and they were more frequently observed to have intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (ionm) changes (p = 0.018). the deteriorated cohort had greater c7sva at baseline (p = 0.0028) but were comparable in terms of all other radiographic parameters. no radiographic differences were seen between the groups at the 6-week visit; however, the deteriorated cohort experienced greater change in pi-ll (p < 0.0001), lumbar lordosis (p = 0.0461), c7sva (p = 0.0004), and t1pa (p < 0.0001). multivari-ate logistic regression demonstrated that the presence of ionm changes and each degree of negative change in t1pa conferred 3.71 (95% ci 1.01-13.42) and 1.09 (1.01-1.19) greater odds of postoperative lems deterioration, respectively. conclusions in this study, 15.6% of asd patients incurred lems decline in the perioperative period. the magnitude of change in global sagittal alignment, specifically t1pa, was the strongest independent predictor of lems decline, which has implications for surgical planning, patient counseling, and clinical research. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2023.3.spine221311",AB_0606
"high performance computing has a great potential to provide a range of significant benefits for investigating biological systems. these systems often present large modelling problems with many coupled subsystems, such as when studying colonies of bacteria cells. the aim to understand cell colonies has generated substantial interest as they can have strong economic and societal impacts through their roles in in industrial bioreactors and complex community structures, called biofilms, found in clinical settings. investigating these communities through realistic models can rapidly exceed the capabilities of current serial software. here, we introduce bmx, a software system developed for the high performance modelling of large cell communities by utilising gpu acceleration. bmx builds upon the amrex adaptive mesh refinement package to efficiently model cell colony formation under realistic laboratory conditions. using simple test scenarios with varying nutrient availability, we show that bmx is capable of correctly reproducing observed behavior of bacterial colonies on realistic time scales demonstrating a potential application of high performance computing to colony modelling. the open source software is available from the zenodo repository https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8084270 under the bsd-2-clause licence.",AB_0606
"rna tertiary structures from experiments or computational predictions often contain missing atoms, which prevent analyses requiring full atomic structures. current programs for rna reconstruction can be slow, inaccurate, and/or require specific atoms to be present in the input. we present arena (atomic recon-struction of rna), which reconstructs a full atomic rna structure from residues that can have as few as one atom. arena first fills in missing atoms and then iteratively refines their placement to reduce non -ideal geometries. we benchmarked arena on a dataset of 361 rna structures, where arena achieves high accuracy and speed compared to other structure reconstruction programs. for example, arena was used to reconstruct full atomic structures from a single phosphorus atom per nucleotide to, on aver-age, within 3.63 a & dblbond; rmsd of the experimental structure, while virtually removing all clashes and running in <3 s, which is 353x and 46x faster than state-of-the-art programs pdbfixer and c2a, respectively. the arena source code is available at https://github.com/pylelab/arena and the webserver at https://zhang-group.org/arena/.& copy; 2023 the authors. published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0606
"background single-cell transcriptomic studies have greatly improved organ-specific insights into macrophage polarization states are essential for the initiation and resolution of inflammation in all tissues; however, such insights are yet to translate into therapies that can predictably alter macrophage fate. method using machine learning algorithms on human macrophages, here we reveal the continuum of polarization states that is shared across diverse contexts. a path, comprised of 338 genes accurately identified both physiologic and pathologic spectra of reactivity and tolerance, and remained relevant across tissues, organs, species, and immune cells (>12,500 diverse datasets). findings this 338-gene signature identified macrophage polarization states at single-cell resolution, in physiology and across diverse human diseases, and in murine pre-clinical disease models. the signature consistently outperformed conventional signatures in the degree of transcriptome-proteome overlap, and in detecting disease states; it also prognosticated outcomes across diverse acute and chronic diseases, e.g., sepsis, liver fibrosis, aging, and cancers. crowd-sourced genetic and pharmacologic studies confirmed that model-rationalized interventions trigger predictable macrophage fates. interpretation these findings provide a formal and universally relevant definition of macrophage states and a predictive framework (http://hegemon.ucsd.edu/smart) for the scientific community to develop macrophage-targeted precision diagnostics and therapeutics.",AB_0606
"the hi-c experiments have been extensively used for the studies of genomic structures. in the last few years, spatiotemporal hi-c has largely contributed to the investigation of genome dynamic reorganization. however, computationally modeling and forecasting spatiotemporal hi-c data still have not been seen in the literature. we present hic4d for dealing with the problem of forecasting spatiotemporal hi-c data. we designed and benchmarked a novel network and named it residual convlstm (resconvlstm), which is a combination of residual network and convolutional long short-term memory (convlstm). we evaluated our new resconvlstm networks and compared them with the other five methods, including a naive network (naivenet) that we designed as a baseline method and four outstanding video-prediction methods from the literature: convlstm, spatiotemporal lstm (st-lstm), self-attention lstm (sa-lstm) and simple video prediction (simvp). we used eight different spatiotemporal hi-c datasets for the blind test, including two from mouse embryogenesis, one from somatic cell nuclear transfer (scnt) embryos, three embryogenesis datasets from different species and two non-embryogenesis datasets. our evaluation results indicate that our resconvlstm networks almost always outperform the other methods on the eight blind-test datasets in terms of accurately predicting the hi-c contact matrices at future time-steps. our benchmarks also indicate that all of the methods that we benchmarked can successfully recover the boundaries of topologically associating domains called on the experimental hi-c contact matrices. taken together, our benchmarks suggest that hic4d is an effective tool for predicting spatiotemporal hi-c data. hic4d is publicly available at both http://dna.cs.miami.edu/hic4d/ and https://github.com/zwang-bioinformatics/hic4d/.",AB_0606
"federated association testing is a powerful approach to conduct large-scale association studies where sites share intermediate statistics through a central server. there are, however, several standing challenges. confounding factors like population stratification should be carefully modeled across sites. in addition, it is crucial to consider disease etiology using flexible models to prevent biases. privacy protections for participants pose another significant challenge. here, we propose distributed mixed effects genome-wide association study (dmega), a method that enables federated generalized linear mixed model-based association testing across multiple sites without explicitly sharing genotype and phenotype data. dmega employs a reference projection to correct for population-stratification and utilizes efficient local-gradient updates among sites, incorporating both fixed and random effects. the accuracy and efficiency of dmega are demonstrated through simulated and real datasets. dmega is publicly available at https://github.com/li-wentao/dmega.",AB_0606
"background species tree estimation is a basic step in many biological research projects, but is complicated by the fact that gene trees can differ from the species tree due to processes such as incomplete lineage sorting (ils), gene duplication and loss (gdl), and horizontal gene transfer (hgt), which can cause different regions within the genome to have different evolutionary histories (i.e., gene tree heterogeneity). one approach to estimating species trees in the presence of gene tree heterogeneity resulting from ils operates by computing trees on each genomic region (i.e., computing gene trees) and then using these gene trees to define a matrix of average internode distances, where the internode distance in a tree t between two species x and y is the number of nodes in t between the leaves corresponding to x and y. given such a matrix, a tree can then be computed using methods such as neighbor joining. methods such as astrid and njst (which use this basic approach) are provably statistically consistent, very fast (low degree polynomial time) and have had high accuracy under many conditions that makes them competitive with other popular species tree estimation methods. in this study, inspired by the very recent work of weighted astral, we present weighted astrid, a variant of astrid that takes the branch uncertainty on the gene trees into account in the internode distance. results our experimental study evaluating weighted astrid typically shows improvements in accuracy compared to the original (unweighted) astrid, and shows competitive accuracy against weighted astral, the state of the art. our re-implementation of astrid also improves the runtime, with marked improvements on large datasets. conclusions weighted astrid is a new and very fast method for species tree estimation that typically improves upon astrid and has comparable accuracy to weighted astral, while remaining much faster. weighted astrid is available at https://github.com/runeblaze/internode.",AB_0606
"motivation: quantification of microbial covariations from 16s rrna and metagenomic sequencing data is difficult due to their sparse nature. in this article, we propose using copula models with mixed zero-beta margins for the estimation of taxon-taxon covariations using data of normalized microbial relative abundances. copulas allow for separate modeling of the dependence structure from the margins, marginal covariate adjustment, and uncertainty measurement. results: our method shows that a two-stage maximum-likelihood approach provides accurate estimation of model parameters. a corresponding two-stage likelihood ratio test for the dependence parameter is derived and is used for constructing covariation networks. simulation studies show that the test is valid, robust, and more powerful than tests based upon pearson's and rank correlations. furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can be used to build biologically meaningful microbial networks based on a dataset from the american gut project. availability and implementation: r package for implementation is available at https://github.com/rebeccadeek/comicon.",AB_0606
"feature selection to identify spatially variable genes or other biologically informative genes is a key step during analyses of spatially-resolved transcriptomics data. here, we propose nnsvg, a scalable approach to identify spatially variable genes based on nearest-neighbor gaussian processes. our method (i) identifies genes that vary in expression continuously across the entire tissue or within a priori defined spatial domains, (ii) uses gene-specific estimates of length scale parameters within the gaussian process models, and (iii) scales linearly with the number of spatial locations. we demonstrate the performance of our method using experimental data from several technological platforms and simulations. a software implementation is available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/nnsvg.",AB_0606
