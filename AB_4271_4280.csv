"recognition of arabic-like scripts such as persian and urdu is more challenging than latin-based scripts. this is due to the presence of a two-dimensional structure, context-dependent character shapes, spaces and overlaps, and placement of diacritics. we present an attention based encoder-decoder model that learns to read handwritten text in context. a novel localization penalty is introduced to encourage the model to attend only one location at a time when recognizing the next character. in addition, we comprehensively refine the only complete and publicly available handwritten urdu dataset in terms of ground-truth annotations. we evaluate the model on both urdu and arabic datasets. for urdu, contextual attention localization achieves 82.06% character recognition rate and 51.97% word recognition rate which represent more than 2x improvement over existing bi-directional lstm models. for arabic, the model outperforms multi-directional lstm models with 77.47% character recognition rate and 37.66% word recognition rate without performing any slant or skew correction. code and pre-trained models for this work are available at https://github.com/nazar-khan/caltext.",AB_0428
"nuclei instance segmentation is an integral step in digital pathology workflow as it is a prerequisite for most downstream tasks such as patient survival analysis, precision medicine, and cancer prognosis. there exist many challenges such as quality of labeled data, staining variation among tissue slides, high variation among multi-organ & multi-center digital slides and overlapping nuclei that are difficult to separate. therefore, it is important to have an automatic and robust nuclei instance segmentation model that saves the time of pathologists by delineating accurate nuclei instances. to this end, we develop a nuclei instance segmentation pipeline that estimates distance transform and nuclear masks using an encoder-decoder-based cnn model. these estimated distance transform and nuclear masks are then utilized to delineate accurate nuclei boundaries from overlapping nuclei. we demonstrate that our proposed nc-net model is lightweight and produces state-of-the-art results on the three recently published largest nuclei instance segmentation datasets to date. additionally, our proposed nc-net model is faster and utilizes a fewer number of parameters for learning as compared to other top-performing nuclei instance segmentation models. the purpose of developing a lightweight and state-of-the-art model is to provide capacity building to digital pathology workflows by reducing inference times and delineating accurate nuclear instances. the implementation details and the trained models are made available at this https://github.com/nauyan/nc-net.",AB_0428
"skin diseases are a common health issue, affecting nearly one-third of the global population, but they are often underestimated in terms of their impact despite being highly visible. accurately diagnosing skin diseases can be challenging sometimes. fortunately, deep learning algorithms have shown great potential for a variety of tasks, including the diagnosis of skin diseases. this research presents a novel dataset of 31 skin diseases by blending two different datasets. three different cnn types, which were efficientnet, resnet, and vgg with different architectures, were used for transfer learning on the skin disease dataset. efficientnet had the highest testing accuracy, thus, it was further trained for fine-tuning. initially, using the training split of 70%, the efficientnet model achieved a testing accuracy of 71%. therefore, as this was considered low, the 70% training split comprising 3,424 samples was further augmented. as a result, the model's accuracy improved to 72%. however, it was observed that the data split of 70/30 was not effective, thus the experiment was re-conducted with a train-test split of 80/20 and an improvement in accuracy score i.e., 74% was observed. to further improve the model's accuracy, augmentations were applied to the data and were able to achieve an accuracy of 87.15%. finally, the trained model with the best accuracy was deployed on a streamlit webserver. the proposed model can help society in diagnosing skin disease early, therefore it can be treated timely. the webserver of efficientskindis can be accessed at (https://abdulrafay97-efficientskindis-app-ooncon.streamlit.app/).",AB_0428
"motivation: deep learning attained excellent results in digital pathology recently. a challenge with its use is that high quality, representative training datasets are required to build robust models. data annotation in the domain is labor intensive and demands substantial time commitment from expert pathologists. active learning (al) is a strategy to minimize annotation. the goal is to select samples from the pool of unlabeled data for annotation that improves model accuracy. however, al is a very compute demanding approach. the benefits for model learning may vary according to the strategy used, and it may be hard for a domain specialist to fine tune the solution without an integrated interface. results: we developed a framework that includes a friendly user interface along with run-time optimizations to reduce annotation and execution time in al in digital pathology. our solution implements several al strategies along with our diversity-aware data acquisition (dada) acquisition function, which enforces data diversity to improve the prediction performance of a model. in this work, we employed a model simplification strategy [network autoreduction (nar)] that significantly improves al execution time when coupled with dada. nar produces less compute demanding models, which replace the target models during the al process to reduce processing demands. an evaluation with a tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes classification application shows that: (i) dada attains superior performance compared to state-of-the-art al strategies for different convolutional neural networks (cnns), (ii) nar improves the al execution time by up to 4.3x, and (iii) target models trained with patches/data selected by the nar reduced versions achieve similar or superior classification quality to using target cnns for data selection. availability and implementation: source code: https://github.com/alsmeirelles/dada.",AB_0428
"background: patients with brugada syndrome (brs) are recommended to avoid drugs that may increase their risk of arrhythmic events. we examined treatment with such drugs in patients with brs after their diagnosis.methods and results: all danish patients diagnosed with brs (2006- 2018) with >12 months of follow -up were identified from nationwide registries. nonrecommended brs drugs were grouped into drugs to avoid or preferably avoid according to http://www.brugadadrugs.org. cox proportional hazards analyses were performed to identify factors associated with any nonrecommended brs drug use, and logistic regression analyses were performed to examine associated risk of appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy, mortality, and a combined end point indicating an arrhythmic event of delayed implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation, appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy, and mortality. during a median follow -up of 6.8 years, 93/270 (34.4%) patients with brs (70.4% male, median age at diagnosis 46.1 years [interquartile range, 32.6- 57.4]) were treated with =1 nonrecommended brs drugs. no difference in any nonrecommended brs drug use was identified comparing time before brs diagnosis (12.6%) with each of the 5 years following brs diagnosis (p>0.05). factors associated with any nonrecommended brs drug use after diagnosis were female sex (hazard ratio [hr]) 1.83 [95% ci, 1.15- 2.90]), psychiatric disease (hr, 3.63 [1.89- 6.99]), and prior use of any nonrecommended brs drug (hr, 4.76 [2.45- 9.25]). no significant association between any nonrecommended brs drug use and implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy (n=20/97, odds ratio [or], 0.7 [0.2- 2.4]), mortality (n=10/270, or, 3.4 [0.7- 19.6]), or the combined end point (n=38/270, or, 1.7 [0.8- 3.7]) was identified. conclusions: one in 3 patients with brs were treated with a nonrecommended brs drug after brs diagnosis, and a brs diagnosis did not change prescription patterns. more awareness of nonrecommended drug use among patients with brs is needed.",AB_0428
"multiple types and classes of medications are administered in the acute management of traumatic spinal cord injury. prior clinical studies and evidence from animal models suggest that several of these medications could modify (i.e., enhance or impede) neurological recovery. we aimed to systematically determine the types of medications commonly administered, alone or in combination, in the transition from acute to subacute spinal cord injury. for that purpose, type, class, dosage, timing, and reason for administration were extracted from two large spinal cord injury datasets. descriptive statistics were used to describe the medications administered within the first 60 days after spinal cord injury. across 2040 individuals with spinal cord injury, 775 unique medications were administered within the two months after injury. on average, patients enrolled in a clinical trial were administered 9.9 +/- 4.9 (range 0-34), 14.3 +/- 6.3 (range 1-40), 18.6 +/- 8.2 (range 0-58), and 21.5 +/- 9.7 (range 0-59) medications within the first 7, 14, 30, and 60 days post-injury, respectively. those enrolled in an observational study were administered on average 1.7 +/- 1.7 (range 0-11), 3.7 +/- 3.7 (range 0-24), 8.5 +/- 6.3 (range 0-42), and 13.5 +/- 8.3 (range 0-52) medications within the first 7, 14, 30, and 60 days post-injury, respectively. polypharmacy was commonplace (up to 43 medications per day per patient). approximately 10% of medications were administered acutely as prophylaxis (e.g., against the development of pain or infections). to our knowledge, this was the first time acute pharmacological practices have been comprehensively examined after spinal cord injury. our study revealed a high degree of polypharmacy in the acute stages of spinal cord injury, raising the potential to impact neurological recovery. all results can be interactively explored on the rxsci web site (https://jutzelec. shinyapps.io/rxsci/) and github repository (https://github.com/jutzca/acute-.pharmacological-.treat ment-.in-.sci/).",AB_0428
"background: twenty percent to 40% of patients are affected by angina after percutaneous coronary intervention (pci), which is associated with anxiety, depression, impaired physical function, and reduced quality of life. understanding patient and procedural factors associated with post-pci angina may inform alternative approaches to treatment. methods: two hundred thirty patients undergoing pci completed the seattle angina questionnaire (saq-7) and european quality of life- 5 dimension-5 level (eq-5d-5l) questionnaires at baseline and 3 months post-pci. patients received blinded intracoronary physiology assessments before and after stenting. a post hoc analysis was performed to compare clinical and procedural characteristics among patients with and without post-pci angina (defined by follow-up saq-angina frequency score <100). results: eighty-eight of 230 patients (38.3%) reported angina 3 months post-pci and had a higher incidence of active smoking, atrial fibrillation, and history of previous myocardial infarction or pci. compared with patients with no angina at follow-up, they had lower baseline saq summary scores (69.48 +/- 24.12 versus 50.20 +/- 22.59, p<0.001) and eq-5d-5l health index scores (0.84 +/- 0.15 versus 0.69 +/- 0.22, p<0.001). pre-pci fractional flow reserve (ffr) was lower among patients who had no post-pci angina (0.56 +/- 0.15 versus 0.62 +/- 0.13, p=0.003). percentage change in ffr after pci had a moderate correlation with angina frequency score at follow-up (r=0.36, p<0.0001). patients with post-pci angina had less improvement in ffr (43.1 +/- 33.5% versus 67.0 +/- 50.7%, p<0.001). there were no between-group differences in post-pci ffr, coronary flow reserve, or corrected index of microcirculatory resistance. patients with post-pci angina had lower saq-summary scores (64.01 +/- 22 versus 95.16 +/- 8.72, p=0.001) and eq-5d-5l index scores (0.69 +/- 0.26 versus 0.91 +/- 0.17, p=0.001) at follow-up. conclusions: larger improvements in ffr following pci were associated with less angina and better quality of life at follow-up. in patients with stable symptoms, intracoronary physiology assessment can inform expectations of angina relief and quality of life improvement after stenting and thereby help to determine the appropriateness of pci. registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct03259815.",AB_0428
"choosing the best constitutive model and the right set of model parameters is at the heart of continuum mechanics. for decades, the gold standard in constitutive modeling has been to first select a model and then fit its parameters to data. however, the success of this approach dependends hugely on user experience and personal preference. here we propose a new method that simultaneously and fully autonomously discovers the best model and parameters to explain experimental data. mathematically, model discovery translates into a complex non-convex optimization problem. we solve this problem by formulating it as a neural network, and leverage the success, robustness, and stability of the optimization tools developed in deep learning. yet, instead of using a classical off-the-shelf neural network, we design our own family of constitutive artificial neural networks with activation functions that feature popular constitutive models and parameters that have a clear physical interpretation. our new network inherently satisfies general kinematic, thermodynamic, and physical constraints and trains robustly, even with sparse data. we illustrate its potential for biaxial extension experiments on skin and demonstrate that the majority of network weights train to zero, while the small subset of non-zero weights defines the discovered model. unlike classical network weights, these weights are physically interpretable and translate naturally into engineering parameters and microstructural features such as stiffnesses and fiber orientations. our results suggest that constitutive artificial neural networks enable a fully automated model, parameter, and experiment discovery and could induce a paradigm shift in constitutive modeling, from manual to automated model selection and parameterization. our source code, data, and examples are available at https://github.com/livi (c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0428
"we present a novel approach for extracting metric volume information of fruits and vegetables from short monocular video sequences and associated inertial data recorded with a hand-held smartphone. estimated segmentation masks from a pre-trained object detector are fused with the predicted change in relative pose obtained from the inertial data to predict the class and volume of the objects of interest. our approach works with simple rgb video frames and inertial data which are readily available from modern smartphones. it does not require reference objects of known size in the video frames. using a balanced validation dataset, we achieve a classification accuracy of 95% and a mean absolute percentage error for the volume prediction of 16% on untrained objects, which is comparable to state-of-the-art results requiring more elaborated data recording setups. a very accurate estimation of the model uncertainty is achieved through ensembling and the use of gaussian negative log-likelihood loss. the dataset used in our experiments including ground-truth volume information is available at https://sst.aau.at/cns/datasets.",AB_0428
"there are increasing rates of internalising difficulties, particularly anxiety and depression, being reported in children and young people in england. school-based universal prevention programmes are thought to be one way of helping tackle such difficulties. this paper describes an update to a four-arm cluster randomised controlled trial (http://www.isrctn.com/isrctn16386254), investigating the effectiveness of three different interventions when compared to usual provision, in english primary and secondary pupils. due to the covid-19 pandemic, the trial was put on hold and subsequently prolonged. data collection will now run until 2024. the key changes to the trial outlined here include clarification of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, an amended timeline reflecting changes to the recruitment period of the trial due to the covid-19 pandemic and clarification of the data that will be included in the statistical analysis, since the second wave of the trial was disrupted due to covid-19.",AB_0428
