"background: in recent years, advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled the use of genomic information in many fields, such as precision medicine, oncology, and food quality control. the amount of genomic data being generated is growing rapidly and is expected to soon surpass the amount of video data. the majority of sequencing experiments, such as genome-wide association studies, have the goal of identifying variations in the gene sequence to better understand phenotypic variations. we present a novel approach for compressing gene sequence variations with random access capability: the genomic variant codec (gvc). we use techniques such as binarization, joint row-and column-wise sorting of blocks of variations, as well as the image compression standard jbig for efficient entropy coding.results: our results show that gvc provides the best trade-off between compression and random access compared to the state of the art: it reduces the genotype information size from 758 gib down to 890 mib on the publicly available 1000 genomes project (phase 3) data, which is 21% less than the state of the art in random-access capable methods.conclusions: by providing the best results in terms of combined random access and compression, gvc facilitates the efficient storage of large collections of gene sequence variations. in particular, the random access capability of gvc enables seamless remote data access and application integration. the software is open source and available at https://github.com/sxperfect/gvc/.",AB_0497
"we present genera (https://github.com/josuebarrera/genera), a diamond-fueled gene-family founder inference framework that addresses previously raised limitations and biases in genomic phylostratigraphy, such as homology detection failure. genera also reduces computational time from several months to a few days for any genome of interest. we analyze the emergence of taxonomically restricted gene families during major evolutionary transitions in plants, animals, and fungi. our results indicate that the impact of homology detection failure on inferred patterns of gene emergence is lineage-dependent, suggesting that plants are more prone to evolve novelty through the emergence of new genes compared to animals and fungi.",AB_0497
"glycans are important polysaccharides on cellular surfaces that are bound to glycoproteins and glycolipids. these are one of the most common post-translational modifications of proteins in eukaryotic cells. they play important roles in protein folding, cell-cell interactions, and other extracellular processes. changes in glycan structures may influence the course of different diseases, such as infections or cancer. glycans are commonly represented using the iupac-condensed notation. iupac-condensed is a textual representation of glycans operating on the same topological level as the symbol nomenclature for glycans (snfg) that assigns colored, geometrical shapes to the main monomers. these symbols are then connected in tree-like structures, visualizing the glycan structure on a topological level. yet for a representation on the atomic level, notations such as smiles should be used. to our knowledge, there is no easy-to-use, general, open-source, and offline tool to convert the iupac-condensed notation to smiles. here, we present the open-access python package glyles for the generalizable generation of smiles representations out of iupac-condensed representations. glyles uses a grammar to read in the monomer tree from the iupac-condensed notation. from this tree, the tool can compute the atomic structures of each monomer based on their iupac-condensed descriptions. in the last step, it merges all monomers into the atomic structure of a glycan in the smiles notation. glyles is the first package that allows conversion from the iupac-condensed notation of glycans to smiles strings. this may have multiple applications, including straightforward visualization, substructure search, molecular modeling and docking, and a new featurization strategy for machine-learning algorithms. glyles is available at https://github. com/kalininalab/glyles.",AB_0497
"the use of molecular biomarkers to support disease diagnosis, monitor its progression, and guide drug treatment has gained traction in the last decades. while only a dozen biomarkers have been approved for their exploitation in the clinic by the fda, many more are evaluated in the context of translational research and clinical trials. furthermore, the information on which biomarkers are measured, for which purpose, and in relation to which conditions are not readily accessible: biomarkers used in clinical studies available through resources such as clinicaltrials.gov are described as free text, posing significant challenges in finding, analyzing, and processing them by both humans and machines. we present a text mining strategy to identify proteomic and genomic biomarkers used in clinical trials and classify them according to the methodologies by which they are measured. we find more than 3000 biomarkers used in the context of 2600 diseases. by analyzing this dataset, we uncover patterns of use of biomarkers across therapeutic areas over time, including the biomarker type and their specificity. these data are made available at the clinical biomarker app at https://www.disgenet.org/biomarkers/, a new portal that enables the exploration of biomarkers extracted from the clinical studies available at clinicaltrials.gov and enriched with information from the scientific literature. the app features several metrics that assess the specificity of the biomarkers, facilitating their selection and prioritization. overall, the clinical biomarker app is a valuable and timely resource about clinical biomarkers, to accelerate biomarker discovery, development, and application.

"biodiversity assessment approaches based on molecular biology techniques such as metabarcoding, rad-seq, or snapshot sequencing are increasingly applied in assessing marine and aquatic ecosystems. here we present a new reference database for fish meta-barcoding based on mitochondrial genes. the mare-mage database contains quality-checked sequences of the mitochondrial 12s ribosomal rna and cytochrome c oxidase i gene. all sequences were obtained from the national center for biotechnology information-genbank (nbci-genbank), the european nucleotide archive (ena), aquagene database and bold database, and have undergone intensive processing. they were checked for false annotations and non-target anomalies, according to the integrated taxonomic information system (itis) and fishbase. the dataset is compiled in arb-home, fasta and qiime2 formats, and is publicly available from the mare-mage database website (http://mare-mage.weebly.com/). it includes altogether 231,333 coi and 12s rrna gene sequences of fish, covering 19,506 species of 4,058 genera and 586 families.",AB_0497
"the aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the newly developed similar patient search (sps) web service, which supports reading complex lung diseases in computed tomography (ct), on the diagnostic accuracy of residents. sps is an image-based search engine for pre-diagnosed cases along with related clinical reference content (https://eref.thieme.de). the reference database was constructed using 13,658 annotated regions of interest (rois) from 621 patients, comprising 69 lung diseases. for validation, 50 ct scans were evaluated by five radiology residents without sps, and three months later with sps. the residents could give a maximum of three diagnoses per case. a maximum of 3 points was achieved if the correct diagnosis without any additional diagnoses was provided. the residents achieved an average score of 17.6 +/- 5.0 points without sps. by using sps, the residents increased their score by 81.8% to 32.0 +/- 9.5 points. the improvement of the score per case was highly significant (p = 0.0001). the residents required an average of 205.9 +/- 350.6 s per case (21.9% increase) when sps was used. however, in the second half of the cases, after the residents became more familiar with sps, this increase dropped to 7%. residents' average score in reading complex chest ct scans improved by 81.8% when the ai-driven sps with integrated clinical reference content was used. the increase in time per case due to the use of the sps was minimal.",AB_0497

"in this article, a new version of the real-time image stream algorithms (risa) data processing suite is introduced. it now features online detector data acquisition, high-throughput data dumping and enhanced real-time data processing capabilities. the achieved low-latency real-time data processing extends the application of ultrafast electron beam x-ray computed tomography (ufxct) scanners to real-time scanner control and process control. we implemented high performance data packet reception based on data plane development kit (dpdk) and high-throughput data storing using both hierarchical data format version 5 (hdf5) as well as the adaptable input/output system version 2 (adios2). furthermore, we extended risa's underlying pipelining framework to support the fork-join paradigm. this allows for more complex workflows as it is necessary, e.g. for online data processing. also, the pipeline configuration is moved from compile-time to runtime, i.e. processing stages and their interconnections can now be configured using a configuration file. in several benchmarks, risa is profiled regarding data acquisition performance, data storage throughput and overall processing latency. we found that using direct io mode significantly improves data writing performance on the local data storage. we could further prove that risa is now capable of concurrently receiving, processing and storing data from up to 768 detector channels (3072 mb/s) at 8000 fps on a single-gpu computer in real-time. program summary program title: glados/risa cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /65sx747rvm .2 developer's repository link: https://codebase .helmholtz .cloud /risa licensing provisions: apache-2.0 programming language: c++ journal reference of previous version: comput. phys. commun. 219 (2017) 353-360 [1] does the new version supersede the previous version?: yes. reasons for the new version: extended capabilities for real-time operation with latest ufxct hardware. summary of revisions: (i) add forking and joining of processing pipeline branches (ii) add runtime (re-)configuration of pipeline stages and connections (iii) add udp receiver stage to acquire detector data in real-time (iv) add high-throughput data dumping nature of problem: ultrafast electron beam x-ray computed tomography scanners stream multiple gigabytes of raw data per second via ethernet to a control computer. receiving the data with low latency, real-time image-based control would become possible. for this, data need to be captured from the network, stored on disk, reconstructed and post-processed concurrently. the current total data rate of up to 3072 mb/s requires high-throughput solutions for each of these tasks. solution method: using a pipeline scheme, risa processes incoming raw data in distinct stages (sources, processors, sinks). these are implemented in gpu kernels and are executed concurrently to exploit data parallelism as well as task parallelism. to capture detector data, we implemented a udp packet capturing stage based on dpdk [2] which acts as a source stage. by allowing the pipeline to fork up into multiple branches, we concurrently acquire, store and process the data. for storing these data, we use the hdf5 format [3]. we achieve the required data rates by writing in direct io mode onto an ssd array in raid 0 configuration. additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: risa provides a set of general-purpose processing stages which are suitable for generic image stream processing. references [1] frust t., et al., comput. phys. commun. 219 (2017) 353-360 [2] data plane development kit, https://www.dpdk.org/ [3] hierarchical data format version 5, https://www.hdfgroup .org /solutions /hdf5/ (c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ( .org /licenses /by /4 .0/).",AB_0497

"since the initiation of development at the institute of environmental physics (iup), university of bremen, in 1994, the radiative transfer model sciatran (formerly gometran) has been continuously improved and new versions have been released . in the course of development, the sciatran software package became capable of simulating radiative transfer processes through the earth's atmosphere or coupled atmosphere-ocean system with a variety of approaches to treat the sphericity of the atmosphere (plane-parallel, pseudo-spherical, approximately spherical and full-spherical solutions) in both scalar and vector modes. supported by a variety of built-in databases and parameterizations, these capabilities made sciatran widely used for various remote-sensing applications related to the retrieval of atmospheric trace gases and characteristics of aerosols, clouds and surfaces. this paper presents an overview of the cloud, aerosol and surface (cas) databases and models implemented in the sciatran software package (v4.6) and provides some recommendations on their usage. the new implementations offer potential users a flexible interface to perform radiative transfer simulations: (1) accounting for multilayer liquid water, ice and mixed-phase clouds; (2) employing typical aerosol-type parameterizations (including vertical variability) used in the satellite and model communities as well as updated databases; (3) including various surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (brdf) and albedo models for land, vegetation, ocean, snow and melt ponds on sea ice.the most recent version of the radiative transfer model sciatran is freely available at the website of the iup, university of bremen: http://www.iup.physik.uni-bremen.de/sciatran (last access: november 2022).",AB_0497
