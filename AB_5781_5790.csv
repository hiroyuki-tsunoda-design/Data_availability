"the uv-vis absorption of cyanine dyes is a commonexperimentin many physical chemistry teaching laboratories. as part of the analysis,students are often asked to hypothesize why the predicted absorptiondiffers from the measured values and why dyes which are predictedto have the same absorption have measured values which differ fromeach other. for practical reasons, it is often difficult to have studentstest their proposed explanation with additional measurements. to meetthis need, we have written a small program which generates a sampleabsorption spectrum of 40 (at the time of writing) different cyaninedyes, giving students an opportunity to evaluate their hypotheses.the program is available for download at https://github.com/amansell/conjugated-dyes.",AB_0579
"the mutation spaceof spatially conserved (mssc) amino acid residuesis a protein structural quantity developed and described in this work.the mssc quantifies how many mutations and which different mutations,i.e., the mutation space, occur in each amino acid site in a protein.the mssc calculates the mutation space of amino acids in a targetprotein from the spatially conserved residues in a group of multipleprotein structures. spatially conserved amino acid residues are identifiedbased on their relative positions in the protein structure. the msscexamines each residue in a target protein, compares it to the residuespresent in the same relative position in other protein structures,and uses physicochemical criteria of mutations found in each conservedspatial site to quantify the mutation space of each amino acid inthe target protein. the mssc is analogous to scoring each site ina multiple sequence alignment but in three-dimensional space consideringthe spatial location of residues instead of solely the order in whichthey appear in a protein sequence. mssc analysis was performed onexample cases, and it reproduces the well-known observation that,regardless of secondary structure, solvent-exposed residues are morelikely to be mutated than internal ones. the mssc code is availableon github: https://github.com/cantu-research-group/mutation_space.",AB_0579
"reaction diagram parsing is the task of extracting reactionschemesfrom a diagram in the chemistry literature. the reaction diagramscan be arbitrarily complex; thus, robustly parsing them into structureddata is an open challenge. in this paper, we present rxnscribe, amachine learning model for parsing reaction diagrams of varying styles.we formulate this structured prediction task with a sequence generationapproach, which condenses the traditional pipeline into an end-to-endmodel. we train rxnscribe on a dataset of 1378 diagrams and evaluateit with cross validation, achieving an 80.0% soft match f1 score,with significant improvements over previous models. our code and dataare publicly available at https://github.com/thomas0809/rxnscribe.",AB_0579
"background the web-based gmdi/sern pku nutrition management guideline, published before approval of pegvaliase pharmacotherapy, offers guidance for nutrition management of individuals with phenylketonuria (pku) treated with dietary therapy and/or sapropterin. an update of this guideline aims to provide recommendations that improve clinical outcomes and promote consistency and best practice in the nutrition management of individuals with pku receiving pegvaliase therapy. methodology includes: formulation of a research question; review, critical appraisal, and abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished practice literature; expert input through delphi surveys and a nominal group process; and external review by metabolic experts. results recommendations, summary statements, and strength of evidence are included for each of the following topics: (1) initiating a pegvaliase response trial, (2) monitoring therapy response and nutritional status, (3) managing pegvaliase treatment after response to therapy, (4) education and support for optimal nutrition with pegvaliase therapy, and (5) pegvaliase therapy during pregnancy, lactation, and adolescence. findings, supported by evidence and consensus, provide guidance for nutrition management of individuals receiving pegvaliase therapy for pku. recommendations focus on nutrition management by clinicians, as well as the challenges for individuals with pku as a result of therapy changes. conclusions successful pegvaliase therapy allows the possibility for individuals with pku to consume an unrestricted diet while still maintaining the benefits of blood phenylalanine control. this necessitates a perspective change in education and support provided to individuals in order to achieve healthy nutrient intake that supports optimal nutritional status. the updated guideline, and companion toolkit for practical implementation of recommendations, is web-based, allowing for utilization by health care providers, researchers, and collaborators who advocate and care for individuals with pku. these guidelines are meant to be followed always taking into account the provider's clinical judgement and considering the individual's specific circumstances. open access is available at the genetic metabolic dietitians international (https://gmdi.org) and southeast regional genetics network (https://managementguidelines. net) websites.",AB_0579
"open-source, publicly available neuroimaging datasets - whether from large-scale data collection efforts or pooled from multiple smaller studies - offer unprecedented sample sizes and promote generalization efforts. releasing data can democratize science, increase the replicability of findings, and lead to discoveries. partly due to patient privacy, computational, and data storage concerns, researchers typically release preprocessed data with the voxelwise time series parcellated into a map of predefined regions, known as an atlas. however, releasing preprocessed data also limits the choices available to the end-user. this is especially true for connectomics, as connectomes created from different atlases are not directly comparable. since there exist several atlases with no gold standards, it is unrealistic to have processed, open-source data available from all atlases. together, these limitations directly inhibit the potential benefits of open-source neuroimaging data. to address these limitations, we introduce cross atlas remapping via optimal transport (carot) to find a mapping between two atlases. this approach allows data processed from one atlas to be directly transformed into a connectome based on another atlas without the need for raw data access. to validate carot, we compare reconstructed connectomes against their original counterparts (i.e., connectomes generated directly from an atlas), demonstrate the utility of transformed connectomes in downstream analyses, and show how a connectome-based predictive model can generalize to publicly available data that was processed with different atlases. overall, carot can reconstruct connectomes from an extensive set of atlases - without needing the raw data - allowing already processed connectomes to be easily reused in a wide range of analyses while eliminating redundant processing efforts. we share this tool as both source code and as a stand-alone web application (http://carotproject.com/).",AB_0579
"when robots interact with humans in homes, roads, or factories the human's behavior often changes in response to the robot. non-stationary humans are challenging for robot learners: actions the robot has learned to coordinate with the original human may fail after the human adapts to the robot. in this paper we introduce an algorithmic formalism that enables robots (i.e., ego agents) to co-adapt alongside dynamic humans (i.e., other agents) using only the robot's low-level states, actions, and rewards. a core challenge is that humans not only react to the robot's behavior, but the way in which humans react inevitably changes both over time and between users. to deal with this challenge, our insight is that-instead of building an exact model of the human-robots can learn and reason over high-level representations of the human's policy and policy dynamics. applying this insight we develop rili: robustly influencing latent intent. rili first embeds low-level robot observations into predictions of the human's latent strategy and strategy dynamics. next, rili harnesses these predictions to select actions that influence the adaptive human towards advantageous, high reward behaviors over repeated interactions. we demonstrate that-given rili's measured performance with users sampled from an underlying distribution-we can probabilistically bound rili's expected performance across new humans sampled from the same distribution. our simulated experiments compare rili to state-of-the-art representation and reinforcement learning baselines, and show that rili better learns to coordinate with imperfect, noisy, and time-varying agents. finally, we conduct two user studies where rili co-adapts alongside actual humans in a game of tag and a tower-building task. see videos of our user studies here: https://youtu.be/wygo5amdxbq",AB_0579

"peak-detectionalgorithms currently used to process untargetedmetabolomics data were designed to maximize sensitivity at the sacrificeof selectively. peak lists returned by conventional software toolstherefore contain a high density of artifacts that do not representreal chemical analytes, which, in turn, hinder downstream analyses.although some innovative approaches to remove artifacts have recentlybeen introduced, they involve extensive user intervention due to thediversity of peak shapes present within and across metabolomics datasets. to address this bottleneck in metabolomics data processing,we developed a semisupervised deep learning-based approach, peakdetective,for classification of detected peaks as artifacts or true peaks. ourapproach utilizes two techniques for artifact removal. first, an unsupervisedautoencoder is used to extract a low-dimensional, latent representationof each peak. second, a classifier is trained with active learningto discriminate between artifacts and true peaks. through active learning,the classifier is trained with less than 100 user-labeled peaks ina matter of minutes. given the speed of its training, peakdetectivecan be rapidly tailored to specific lc/ms methods and sample typesto maximize performance on each type of data set. in addition to curation,the trained models can also be utilized for peak detection to immediatelydetect peaks with both high sensitivity and selectivity. we validatedpeakdetective on five diverse lc/ms data sets, where peakdetectiveshowed greater accuracy compared to current approaches. when appliedto a sars-cov-2 data set, peakdetective enabled more statisticallysignificant metabolites to be detected. peakdetective is open sourceand available as a python package at https://github.com/pattilab/peakdetective.",AB_0579
"understanding materials' composition-structure-functionrelationships is of critical importance for the design and discoveryof novel functional materials. while most such studies focus on individualmaterials, we conducted a global mapping study of all known materialsdeposited in the materials project database to investigate their distributionsin the space of a set of seven compositional, structural, physical,and neural latent descriptors. these two-dimensional materials mapsalong with their density maps allow us to illustrate the distributionof the patterns and clusters of different shapes, which indicatesthe propensity of these materials and the tinkering history of existingmaterials. we then overlap the material properties such as compositionprototypes and piezoelectric properties over the background materialmaps to study the relationships of how material compositions and structuresaffect their physical properties. we also use these maps to studythe spatial distributions of properties of known inorganic materials,in particular those of local vicinities in structural space such asstructural density and functional diversity. these maps provide auniquely comprehensive overview of materials and space and thus revealpreviously undescribed fundamental properties. our methodology canbe easily extended by other researchers to generate their own globalmaterial maps with different background maps and overlap propertiesfor both distribution understanding and cluster-based new materialdiscovery. the source code for feature generation and generated mapsis available at https://github.com/usccolumbia/matglobalmapping.",AB_0579
"analysis of ion mobility spectrometry (ims) data hasbeen challengingand limited the full utility of these measurements. unlike liquidchromatography-mass spectrometry, where a plethora of toolswith well-established algorithms exist, the incorporation of the additionalims dimension requires upgrading existing computational pipelinesand developing new algorithms to fully exploit the advantages of thetechnology. we have recently reported mza, a new and simple mass spectrometrydata structure based on the broadly supported hdf5 format and createdto facilitate software development. while this format is inherentlysupportive of application development, the availability of core librariesin popular programming languages with standard mass spectrometry utilitieswill facilitate fast software development and broader adoption ofthe format. to this end, we present a python package, mzapy, for efficient extraction and processing of mass spectrometry datain the mza format, especially for complex data containing ion mobilityspectrometry dimension. in addition to raw data extraction, mzapy contains supporting utilities enabling tasks includingcalibration, signal processing, peak finding, and generating plots.being implemented in pure python and having minimal and largely standardizeddependencies makes mzapy uniquely suited to applicationdevelopment in the multiomics domain. the mzapy packageis free and open-source, includes comprehensive documentation, andis structured to support future extension to meet the evolving needsof the ms community. the software source code is freely availableat https://github.com/pnnl-m-q/mzapy.",AB_0579
