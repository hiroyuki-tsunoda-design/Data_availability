"motivation with advances in metagenomic sequencing technologies, there are accumulating studies revealing the associations between the human gut microbiome and some human diseases. these associations shed light on using gut microbiome data to distinguish case and control samples of a specific disease, which is also called host disease status classification. importantly, using learning-based models to distinguish the disease and control samples is expected to identify important biomarkers more accurately than abundance-based statistical analysis. however, available tools have not fully addressed two challenges associated with this task: limited labeled microbiome data and decreased accuracy in cross-studies. the confounding factors, such as the diet, technical biases in sample collection/sequencing across different studies/cohorts often jeopardize the generalization of the learning model.results to address these challenges, we develop a new tool gdmicro, which combines semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation to achieve a more generalized model using limited labeled samples. we evaluated gdmicro on human gut microbiome data from 11 cohorts covering 5 different diseases. the results show that gdmicro has better performance and robustness than state-of-the-art tools. in particular, it improves the auc from 0.783 to 0.949 in identifying inflammatory bowel disease. furthermore, gdmicro can identify potential biomarkers with greater accuracy than abundance-based statistical analysis methods. it also reveals the contribution of these biomarkers to the host's disease status.availability and implementation https://github.com/liaoherui/gdmicro.",AB_0209
"using computational models to predict potential lncrna-disease associations (ldas) has emerged as an effective supplement to bioexperiments for exploring the pathogenesis of diseases. however, current computational models still face limitations in their ability to learn the complex features of bionetworks. in this study, hgcnlda, a model which combines graph convolutional network (gcn)-based aggregation, heterogeneous information fusion, and a bilinear-decoder to infer ldas was proposed. recognizing the need to extract essential features during data processing, our hgcnlda explored four key steps for uncovering interaction patterns within the bionetwork: (1) a novel type of tripartite heterogeneous network, known as the lncrna-disease-mirna network (ldmn), was constructed using computed similarities and known associations. (2) homogeneous and heterogeneous features of nodes were extracted from domains within the ldmn by a gcn-based encoder. (3) feature fusions, including bipolymerization operations and attention mechanism, were employed to capture a more accurate and comprehensive representation of nodes. (4) bilinear-decoder was used to rebuild the edge type (or rating type) for a specific node pair, resulting in the predicted association score. through a 5-fold cross-validation on two data sets, namely, data set1 and data set2, our hgcnlda consistently demonstrated superior performance compared to five related models. it almost achieved the highest auroc and aupr values on both data sets, especially on data set2 where the results obtained were more challenging and objective. case studies involving three real cancer scenarios further validated the practicality of hgcnlda in identifying potential ldas in real-world contexts. the source code and data for this study are available at https://github.com/zywait/hgcnlda.",AB_0209
"models based on transformer architecture have risen to prominence for video captioning. however, most models are only to improve either the encoder or the decoder, because when we improve the encoder and decoder simultaneously, the shortcomings of either side may be amplified. based on the transformer architecture, we connect a bidirectional decoder and an encoder that integrates fine-grained spatio-temporal features, objects, and relationships between the objects in the video. experiments show that improvements in the encoder amplify the information leakage of the bidirectional decoder and further produce a worse result. to tackle this problem, we generate pseudo reverse captions and propose a bidirectional transformer with knowledge graph (btkg), which integrates the outputs of two encoders into the forward and backward decoders of the bidirectional decoder, respectively. in addition, we make fine-grained improvements on the interior of the different encoders according to four modal features of the video. experiments on two mainstream benchmark datasets, i.e., msvd and msr-vtt, demonstrate the effectiveness of btkg, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in significant metrics. moreover, the sentences generated by btkg contain scene words and modifiers, that are more in line with human language habits. codes are available on https://github.com/nickchen121/btkg.",AB_0209
"point cloud registration can be solved by searching for correspondence pairs. searching for correspondence pairs in human body point clouds poses some challenges, including: (1) the similar geometrical shapes of the human body are difficult to distinguish. (2) the symmetry of the human body confuses the correspondence pairs searching. to resolve the above issues, this article proposes a hierarchical tolerance mask correspondence (htmc) method to achieve better alignment by tolerating obfuscation. first, we define various levels of correspondence pairs and assign different similarity scores for each level. second, htmc designs a tolerance loss function to tolerate the obfuscation of correspondence pairs. third, htmc uses a differentiable mask to diminish the influence of non-overlapping regions and enhance the influence of overlapping regions. in conclusion, htmc acknowledges the presence of similar local geometry in human body point clouds. on one hand, it avoids overfitting caused by forcibly distinguishing similar geometries, and on the other hand, it prevents genuine correspondence relationships from being masked by similar geometries. the codes are available at https://github.com/ chenpointcloud/htmc.",AB_0209

"backgroundclustering analysis is widely used to interpret biomedical data and uncover new knowledge and patterns. however, conventional clustering methods are not effective when dealing with sparse biomedical data. to overcome this limitation, we propose a hierarchical clustering method called polynomial weight-adjusted sparse clustering (pwsc).resultsthe pwsc algorithm adjusts feature weights using a polynomial function, redefines the distances between samples, and performs hierarchical clustering analysis based on these adjusted distances. additionally, we incorporate a consensus clustering approach to determine the optimal number of classifications. this consensus approach utilizes relative change in the cumulative distribution function to identify the best number of clusters, resulting in more stable clustering results. leveraging the pwsc algorithm, we successfully classified a cohort of gastric cancer patients, enabling categorization of patients carrying different types of altered genes. further evaluation using entropy showed a significant improvement (p = 2.905e-05), while using the calinski-harabasz index demonstrates a remarkable 100% improvement in the quality of the best classification compared to conventional algorithms. similarly, significantly increased entropy (p = 0.0336) and comparable chi, were observed when classifying another colorectal cancer cohort with microbial abundance. the above attempts in cancer subtyping demonstrate that pwsc is highly applicable to different types of biomedical data. to facilitate its application, we have developed a user-friendly tool that implements the pwsc algorithm, which canbe accessed at http://pwsc.aiyimed.com/.conclusionspwsc addresses the limitations of conventional approaches when clustering sparse biomedical data. by adjusting feature weights and employing consensus clustering, we achieve improved clustering results compared to conventional methods. the pwsc algorithm provides a valuable tool for researchers in the field, enabling more accurate and stable clustering analysis. its application can enhance our understanding of complex biological systems and contribute to advancements in various biomedical disciplines.",AB_0209

"image super-resolution (sr) algorithms are placed on high hope to reconstruct ultra-high-definition (uhd) videos from existing low-resolution videos. efficient image quality assessment (iqa) methods could not only evaluate the performances of sr algorithms but also provide reliable feedback for algorithm optimization. however, only a few iqa databases and metrics have been specially designed for sr images. in this paper, we propose a database sr4kiqa containing 4k pristine images and super-resolution 4k distorted images with mean opinion score (mos) labels. distorted sr images are generated by five classic interpolation methods and seven typical dnn-based super-resolution algorithms. then, a large-scale database sr4k298 owning 16688 pairs of sr distorted images is designed to support the training process of the ranking-based blind image quality assessment (biqa) metric we proposed. srocc of our metric rank-sr has already reached 0.87 on the sr4kiqa database before the fine-tuning, which outperforms the state-of-art iqa metrics. as one of the very first iqa databases for 4k sr images artifacts, our database sr4kiqa has been publicly available on http://www.dx.doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.00806 to encourage the further study of the research community.",AB_0209
"motivation gut dysbiosis is closely associated with obesity and related metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes (t2d) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld). the gut microbial features and biomarkers have been increasingly investigated in many studies, which require further validation due to the limited sample size and various confounding factors that may affect microbial compositions in a single study. so far, it lacks a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline providing automated statistical analysis and integrating multiple independent studies for cross-validation simultaneously.results obmeta aims to streamline the standard metagenomics data analysis from diversity analysis, comparative analysis, and functional analysis to co-abundance network analysis. in addition, a curated database has been established with a total of 90 public research projects, covering three different phenotypes (obesity, t2d, and nafld) and more than five different intervention strategies (exercise, diet, probiotics, medication, and surgery). with obmeta, users can not only analyze their research projects but also search and match public datasets for cross-validation. moreover, obmeta provides cross-phenotype and cross-intervention-based advanced validation that maximally supports preliminary findings from an individual study. to summarize, obmeta is a comprehensive web server to analyze and validate gut microbial features and biomarkers for obesity-associated metabolic diseases.availability and implementation obmeta is freely available at: http://obmeta.met-bioinformatics.cn/.",AB_0209
