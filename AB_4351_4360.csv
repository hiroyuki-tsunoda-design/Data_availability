"backgroundwith the emergence of deep-learning methods, tools are needed to capture and standardize image annotations made by experimentalists. in developmental biology, cell lineages are generally reconstructed from time-lapse data. however, some tissues need to be fixed to be accessible or to improve the staining. in this case, classical software do not offer the possibility of generating any lineage. because of their rigid cell walls, plants present the advantage of keeping traces of the cell division history over successive generations in the cell patterns. to record this information despite having only a static image, dedicated tools are required.resultswe developed an interface to assist users in the building and editing of a lineage tree from a 3d labeled image. each cell within the tree can be tagged. from the created tree, cells of a sub-tree or cells sharing the same tag can be extracted. the tree can be exported in a format compatible with dedicated software for advanced graph visualization and manipulation.conclusionsthe treej plugin for imagej/fiji allows the user to generate and manipulate a lineage tree structure. the tree is compatible with other software to analyze the tree organization at the graphical level and at the cell pattern level. the code source is available at https://github.com/l-el/treej.",AB_0436
"diploid a-genome wheat (einkorn wheat) presents a nutrition-rich option as an ancient grain crop and a resource for the improvement of bread wheat against abiotic and biotic stresses. realizing the importance of this wheat species, reference-level assemblies of two einkorn wheat accessions were generated (wild and domesticated). this work reports an einkorn genome database that provides an interface to the cereals research community to perform comparative genomics, applied genetics and breeding research. it features queries for annotated genes, the use of a recent genome browser release, and the ability to search for sequence alignments using a modern blast interface. other features include a comparison of reference einkorn assemblies with other wheat cultivars through genomic synteny visualization and an alignment visualization tool for blast results. altogether, this resource will help wheat research and breeding.database url https://wheat.pw.usda.gov/gg3/pangenome",AB_0436
"antibodies are key proteins of the adaptive immune system, and there exists a large body of academic literature and patents dedicated to their study and concomitant conversion into therapeutics, diagnostics, or reagents. these documents often contain extensive functional characterisations of the sets of antibodies they describe. however, leveraging these heterogeneous reports, for example to offer insights into the properties of query antibodies of interest, is currently challenging as there is no central repository through which this wide corpus can be mined by sequence or structure. here, we present plabdab (the patent and literature antibody database), a self-updating repository containing over 150,000 paired antibody sequences and 3d structural models, of which over 65 000 are unique. we describe the methods used to extract, filter, pair, and model the antibodies in plabdab, and showcase how plabdab can be searched by sequence, structure, or keyword. plabdab uses include annotating query antibodies with potential antigen information from similar entries, analysing structural models of existing antibodies to identify modifications that could improve their properties, and facilitating the compilation of bespoke datasets of antibody sequences/structures that bind to a specific antigen. plabdab is freely available via github (https://github.com/oxpig/plabdab) and as a searchable webserver (https://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/plabdab/). graphical abstract",AB_0436

"biclustering of biologically meaningful binary information is essential in many applications related to drug discovery, like protein-protein interactions and gene expressions. however, for robust performance in recently emerging large health datasets, it is important for new biclustering algorithms to be scalable and fast. we present a rapid unsupervised biclustering (rubic) algorithm that achieves this objective with a novel encoding and search strategy. rubic significantly reduces the computational overhead on both synthetic and experimental datasets shows significant computational benefits, with respect to several state-of-the-art biclustering algorithms. in 100 synthetic binary datasets, our method took similar to 71.1s to extract 494,872 biclusters. in the human ppi database of size 4085 x 4085, our method generates 1840 biclusters in similar to 48.6 s. on a central nervous system embryonic tumor gene expression dataset of size 712,940, our algorithm takes 101 min to produce 747,069 biclusters, while the recent competing algorithms take significantly more time to produce the same result. rubic is also evaluated on five different gene expression datasets and shows significant speed-up in execution time with respect to existing approaches to extract significant keg-genriched bi-clustering. rubic can operate on two modes, base and flex, where base mode generates maximal biclusters and flex mode generates less number of clusters and faster based on their biological significance with respect to kegg pathways. the code is available at (https://github.com/cmaterju-bioinfo/rubic) for academic use only.",AB_0436
"backgrounda substantial proportion of people with bipolar disorder (bd) experience persistent cognitive difficulties associated with impairments in psychosocial functioning and a poorer disorder course. emerging evidence suggests that cognitive remediation (cr), a psychological intervention with established efficacy in people with schizophrenia, can also benefit people with bd. following a proof-of-concept trial showing that cr is feasible and potentially beneficial for people with bd, we are conducting an adequately powered trial in euthymic people with bd to 1) determine whether an individual, therapist-supported, computerised cr can reduce cognitive difficulties and improve functional outcomes; and 2) explore how cr exerts its effects.methodscrib2 is a two-arm, assessor-blind, multi-site, randomised controlled trial (rct) comparing cr to treatment-as-usual (tau). participants are people with a diagnosis of bd, aged between 18 and 65, with no neurological or current substance use disorder, and currently euthymic. 250 participants will be recruited through primary, secondary, tertiary care, and the community. participants will be block-randomised (1:1 ratio, stratified by site) to continue with their usual care (tau) or receive a 12-week course of therapy and usual care (cr + tau). the intervention comprises one-on-one cr sessions with a therapist supplemented with independent cognitive training for 30-40 h in total. outcomes will be assessed at 13- and 25-weeks post-randomisation. efficacy will be examined by intention-to-treat analyses estimating between-group differences in primary (i.e., psychosocial functioning at week 25 measured with the functional assessment short test) and secondary outcomes (i.e., measures of cognition, mood, patient-defined goals, and quality of life). global cognition, metacognitive skills, affect fluctuation, and salivary cortisol levels will be evaluated as putative mechanisms of cr through mediation models.discussionthis study will provide a robust evaluation of efficacy of cr in people with bd and examine the putative mechanisms by which this therapy works. the findings will contribute to determining the clinical utility of cr and potential mechanisms of action.trial registrationcognitive remediation in bipolar 2 (crib2): isrctn registry: https://www.isrctn.com/isrctn10362331. registered 04 may 2022. overall trial status: ongoing; recruitment status: recruiting.",AB_0436

"this paper presents a method for evaluating the quality of images altered by gaussian blur. the method is based on the observation of bokeh mode images where the region of interest (foreground) is sharp, while the remaining parts (background) are intentionally blurred to enhance the perceptual quality of the image. the blurriness of the background increases attention towards the foreground part of the image. the proposed quality metric is obtained by combining the attention factor and the sharpness of the region of interest. the accuracy, in terms of spearman's-rank-order correlation-coefficient (srocc), for popular and publicly available databases such as live, vcl, tid2008, csiq, and tid2013, is 0.963, 0.925, 0.900, 0.930, and 0.930, respectively. the proposed method achieves high and consistent spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient (srocc) values compared to the majority of state-of-the-art algorithms. furthermore, in terms of speed, the proposed method surpasses other state-of-the-art methods. the matlab code of the proposed metric is publicly available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1srmup0n157ati9l3kv13uocxw5phmgqn?usp=sharing.",AB_0436

"background:the efficacy of dietary nitrate supplementation to lower blood pressure (bp) in pregnant women is highly variable. we aimed to investigate whether differences in oral microbiota profiles and oral nitrate-reducing capacity may explain interindividual differences in bp lowering following nitrate supplementation.methods:participants recruited for this study were both pregnant and nonpregnant women, with or without hypertension (n=55). following an overnight fast, plasma, saliva, and tongue scraping samples were collected for measurement of nitrate/nitrite concentrations, oral nar (nitrate reductase) activity, and microbiota profiling using 16s rrna gene sequencing. baseline bp was measured, followed by the administration of a single dose of dietary nitrate (400 mg nitrate in 70 ml beetroot juice). post-nitrate intervention, plasma and salivary nitrate/nitrite concentrations and bp were determined 2.5 hours later.results:women with hypertension had significantly lower salivary nitrite concentrations (p=0.006) and reduced abundance of the nitrate-reducing taxa veillonella(p=0.007) compared with normotensive women. oral nar activity was not significantly different in pregnant versus nonpregnant women (p=0.991) but tended to be lower in hypertensive compared with normotensive women (p=0.099). oral nar activity was associated with both baseline diastolic bp (p=0.050) and change in diastolic bp following acute nitrate intake (p=0.01, adjusted for baseline bp).conclusions:the abundance and activity of oral nitrate-reducing bacteria impact both baseline bp as well as the ability of dietary nitrate supplementation to lower bp. strategies to increase oral nitrate-reducing capacity could lower bp and enhance the efficacy of dietary nitrate supplementation, in pregnancy as well as in nonpregnant adults.registration:url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct03930693.",AB_0436
