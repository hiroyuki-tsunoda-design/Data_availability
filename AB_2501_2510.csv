"multi-label classification with region-free labels is attracting increasing attention compared to that with region-based labels due to the time-consuming manual region-labeling process. existing methods usually employ attention-based technology to discover the conspicuous label-related regions in a weakly-supervised manner with only image-level region-free labels, while the region covering is not precise without exploring global clues of multi-level features. to address this issue, a novel global-guided weakly-supervised learning (gwsl) method for multi-label classification is proposed. the gwsl first extracts the multi-level features to estimate their global correlation map which is further utilized to guide feature disentanglement in the proposed feature disentanglement and localization (fdl) networks. specifically, the fdl networks then adaptively combine the different correlated features and localize the fine-grained features for identifying multiple labels. the proposed method is optimized in an end-to-end manner under weakly supervision with only image-level labels. experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts for multi-label learning problems on several publicly available image datasets. to facilitate similar researches in the future, the codes are directly available online at https://github.com/yong-dai/gwsl.",AB_0251
"advancing spatially resolved transcriptomics (st) technologies help biologists comprehensively understand organ function and tissue microenvironment. accurate spatial domain identification is the foundation for delineating genome heterogeneity and cellular interaction. motivated by this perspective, a graph deep learning (gdl) based spatial clustering approach is constructed in this paper. first, the deep graph infomax module embedded with residual gated graph convolutional neural network is leveraged to address the gene expression profiles and spatial positions in st. then, the bayesian gaussian mixture model is applied to handle the latent embeddings to generate spatial domains. designed experiments certify that the presented method is superior to other state-of-the-art gdl-enabled techniques on multiple st datasets. the codes and dataset used in this manuscript are summarized at https://github. com/narutoten520/scgdl.",AB_0251
"the effective segmentation of the lesion region in gastric cancer images can assist physicians in diagnosing and reducing the probability of misdiagnosis. the u-net has been proven to provide segmentation results comparable to specialists in medical image segmentation because of its ability to extract high-level semantic information. however, it has limitations in obtaining global contextual information. on the other hand, the transformer excels at modeling explicit long-range relations but cannot capture low-level detail information. hence, this paper proposes a dual-branch hybrid network based on the fusion transformer and u-net to overcome both limitations. we propose the deep feature aggregation decoder (dfa) by aggregating only the in-depth features to obtain salient lesion features for both branches and reduce the complexity of the model. besides, we design a feature fusion (ff) module utilizing the multi-modal fusion mechanisms to interact with independent features of various modalities and the linear hadamard product to fuse the feature information extracted from both branches. finally, the transformer loss, the u-net loss, and the fused loss are compared to the ground truth label for joint training. experimental results show that our proposed method has an iou of 81.3%, a dice coefficient of 89.5%, and an accuracy of 94.0%. these metrics demonstrate that our model outperforms the existing models in obtaining high-quality segmentation results, which has excellent potential for clinical analysis and diagnosis. the code and implementation details are available at github, https://github.com/zyy01/dbh-net/.",AB_0251
"motivation: traditional genome-wide association study focuses on testing one-to-one relationship between genetic variants and complex human diseases or traits. while its success in the past decade, this one-to-one paradigm lacks efficiency because it does not utilize the information of intrinsic genetic structure and pleiotropic effects. due to privacy reasons, only summary statistics of current genome-wide association study data are publicly available. existing summary statistics-based association tests do not consider covariates for regression model, while adjusting for covariates including population stratification factors is a routine issue.results: in this work, we first derive the correlation coefficients between summary wald statistics obtained from linear regression model with covariates. then, a new test is proposed by integrating three-level information including the intrinsic genetic structure, pleiotropy, and the potential information combinations. extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed test outperforms three other existing methods under most of the considered scenarios. real data analysis of polyunsaturated fatty acids further shows that the proposed test can identify more genes than the compared existing methods.availability and implementation: code is available at https://github.com/bschilder/threewaytest.",AB_0251
"background: the rapid development of synthetic biology relies heavily on the use of databases and computational tools, which are also developing rapidly. while many tool registries have been created to facilitate tool retrieval, sharing, and reuse, no relatively comprehensive tool registry or catalog addresses all aspects of synthetic biology. results: we constructed synbiotools, a comprehensive collection of synthetic biology databases, computational tools, and experimental methods, as a one-stop facility for searching and selecting synthetic biology tools. synbiotools includes databases, computational tools, and methods extracted from reviews via scientific table extraction, a scientific table-extraction tool that we built. approximately 57% of the resources that we located and included in synbiotools are not mentioned in bio.tools, the dominant tool registry. to improve users' understanding of the tools and to enable them to make better choices, the tools are grouped into nine modules (each with subdivisions) based on their potential biosynthetic applications. detailed comparisons of similar tools in every classification are included. the urls, descriptions, source references, and the number of citations of the tools are also integrated into the system. conclusions: synbiotools is freely available at https://synbiotools.lifesynther.com/. it provides end-users and developers with a useful resource of categorized synthetic biology databases, tools, and methods to facilitate tool retrieval and selection.",AB_0251
"identification of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (edcs) is crucial in the reduction of human health risks. however, it is hard to do so because of the complex mechanisms of the edcs. in this study, we propose a novel strategy named edc-predictor to integrate pharmacological and toxicological profiles for the prediction of edcs. different from conventional methods that only focus on a few nuclear receptors (nrs), edc-predictor considers more targets. it uses computational target profiles from network-based and machine learning-based methods to characterize compounds, including both edcs and non-edcs. the best model constructed by these target profiles outperformed those models by molecular fingerprints. in a case study to predict nr-related edcs, edc-predictor showed a wider applicability domain and higher accuracy than four previous tools. another case study further demonstrated that edc-predictor could predict edcs targeting other proteins rather than nrs. finally, a free web server was developed to make edc prediction easier (http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/edcpred/). in summary, edc-predictor would be a powerful tool in edc prediction and drug safety assessment.",AB_0251
"over the past few years, single image super-resolution (sr) has become a hotspot in the remote sensing area, and numerous methods have made remarkable progress in this fundamental task. however, they usually rely on the assumption that images suffer from a fixed known degradation process, e.g., bicubic downsampling. to save us from performance drop when real-world distribution deviates from the naive assumption, blind image super-resolution for multiple and unknown degradations has been explored. nevertheless, the lack of a real-world dataset and the challenge of reasonable degradation estimation hinder us from moving forward. in this paper, a self-supervised degradation-guided adaptive network is proposed to mitigate the domain gap between simulation and reality. firstly, the complicated degradations are characterized by robust representations in embedding space, which promote adaptability to the downstream sr network with degradation priors. specifically, we incorporated contrastive learning to blind remote sensing image sr, which guides the reconstruction process by encouraging the positive representations (relevant information) while punishing the negatives. besides, an effective dual-wise feature modulation network is proposed for feature adaptation. with the guide of degradation representations, we conduct modulation on feature and channel dimensions to transform the low-resolution features into the desired domain that is suitable for reconstructing high-resolution images. extensive experiments on three mainstream datasets have demonstrated our superiority against state-of-the-art methods. our source code can be found at https://github.com/xy-boy/drsr",AB_0251
"background: although both spinal and general anaesthesia provides good anaesthesia for cervical conization, spinal anaesthesia delays the return of lower limb movements and urinary function, whereas general anaesthesia requires the patient to be unconscious. it is unclear which anaes-thetic technique is more conducive to early postoperative recovery in patients undergoing cer-vical conization. patients and methods: 140 patients undergoing cervical conization underwent either laryngeal mask general anaesthesia (lma, n = 70) or spinal anaesthesia (sa, n = 70). in the lma group, an i-gel mask was used for airway management. in the sa group, spinal anaesthesia was received with 0.75% ropivacaine (15 mg) in the l3-4 interval. the quality of recovery score (qor-15) was the primary endpoint of the study. secondary endpoints included incidence of adverse 24-h analgesia (nrs>3); return of lower limb activity; first bed activity and feeding; and the num-ber of catheters removed at 6, 12 and 24 h postoperatively. result: the lma group significantly improved qor-15 scores (136.62 +/- 11.02 vs 119.97 +/- 12.75; p < 0.001); and reduced the incidence of poor analgesia (nrs >3) within 24 h postoperatively (20% vs 42.8%, p = 0.006); reduced time in bed (15.62 +/- 3.83 h vs 18.27 +/- 5.57 vs, p = 0.001); improved patient satisfaction (86% vs 27%; p < 0.001); and catheters removal within 24 h (70/70 vs 42/70, p < 0.001). conclusion: lma general anaesthesia can facilitate early postoperative recovery in patients un-dergoing cervical conization compared with conventional spinal anaesthesia. trial registration: chinese clinical trial registry (id: chictr1800019384), http://www.chictr. org.cn/listbycreater.aspx (08/11/2018).",AB_0251
"enabling image-text matching is important to understand both vision and language. existing methods utilize the cross attention mechanism to explore deep semantic information. however, the majority of these methods need to perform two types of alignment, which is extremely time-consuming. in addition, current methods do not consider the digital information within the image or text, which may lead to a reduction in retrieval performance. in this paper, we propose a multi-level network, which is based on the transformer encoder for fine-grained, image-text matching. first, we use the transformer encoder to extract intra-modality relations within the image and text and perform the alignment through an efficient aggregating method, rendering the alignment more efficient and the intra-modality information fully utilized. second, we capture the discriminative digital information within the image and text to make the representation more distinguishable. finally, we utilize the global information of the image and text as complementary information to enhance the representation. according to our experimental results, significant improvements in terms of retrieval tasks and runtime estimation can be achieved compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. the source code is available at https://github.com/cqulab/mnte.",AB_0251
"motivation: single-cell rna-sequencing (scrna-seq) technologies provide an opportunity to infer cell-specific gene regulatory networks (grns), which is an important challenge in systems biology. although numerous methods have been developed for inferring grns from scrna-seq data, it is still a challenge to deal with cellular heterogeneity.results: to address this challenge, we developed an interpretable transformer-based method namely stgrns for inferring grns from scrna-seq data. in this algorithm, gene expression motif technique was proposed to convert gene pairs into contiguous sub-vectors, which can be used as input for the transformer encoder. by avoiding missing phase-specific regulations in a network, gene expression motif can improve the accuracy of grn inference for different types of scrna-seq data. to assess the performance of stgrns, we implemented the comparative experiments with some popular methods on extensive benchmark datasets including 21 static and 27 time-series scrnaseq dataset. all the results show that stgrns is superior to other comparative methods. in addition, stgrns was also proved to be more interpretable than black box deep learning methods, which are well-known for the difficulty to explain the predictions clearly.availability and implementation: the source code and data are available at https://github.com/zhanglab-wbgcas/ stgrns.",AB_0251
