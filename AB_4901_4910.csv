"background the clinical and anatomic complexity of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (pci) has increased significantly over the past 2 decades. contrast induced nephropathy (cin) significantly impacts prognosis after pci, therefore minimizing the risk of cin is important in improving clinical outcomes. dynamic coronary roadmap (dcr) is a pci navigation support tool which may decrease cin by projecting a motion-compensated virtual coronary roadmap overlay on fluoroscopy, potentially reducing iodinated contrast volume during pci.study design and objectives the dynamic coronary roadmap for contrast reduction trial (dcr4contrast) is a multi-center, prospective, unblinded, stratified 1:1 randomized controlled trial investigating if dcr use reduces the total contrast volume administered during pci compared to pci performed without dcr guidance. dcr4contrast aims to recruit 394 patients undergoing pci. the primary end point is the total undiluted iodinated contrast volume administered during the pci, performed with or without dcr. as of november 14, 2022, 346 subjects have been enrolled. conclusions the dcr4contrast study will investigate the potential contrast-sparing effect of the dcr navigation support tool in patients undergoing pci. by reducing iodinated contrast administration, dcr has the potential to contribute to reduced risk of cin and thus increase pci safety.clinical trial registration url https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04085614 (am heart j 2023;263:151-158.)",AB_0491
"the rise of artificial intelligence (ai) is accompanied by a growing need for methods to explain the decisions of ai models. in the last decade, new explanation methods have been developed in the field of explainable ai (xai) that enable the interpretation of predictions and provide additional information to human experts. in computer vision tasks, xai methods are typically used to compute heatmaps to identify regions or pixels of an image that were particularly relevant to the output of the ai model. heatmaps computed on deep neural networks often appear visually noisy due to the shattered gradients problem. therefore, several explanation methods use multiplication by the input values to increase contrast and reduce noise in heatmaps. however, this can induce a bias with the magnitude of the input values in the explanation. in this work, we proposed a novel technique called sign, which can be combined with existing xai methods to prevent this bias. we implemented sign-based variants of the existing xai methods gradient x input, smoothgrad, deconvnet, guided backpropagation, and layer-wise relevance propagation (lrp), called gradient x sign, smoothgrad x sign, deconvnet x sign, guided backpropagation x sign, and lrp-sign, and compared them to ten state-of-the-art xai methods on mnist, imagenet, and mit places365 using different dense and convolutional model architectures. the signed explanations were able to outperform the existing methods in all tested metrics. the code to reproduce the experiments is available from github via https://github.com/nilsgumpfer/sign.",AB_0491
"introduction: there is a large interindividual variability in cognitive functioning with increasing age due to biological and lifestyle factors. one of the most important lifestyle factors is the level of physical fitness (pf). the link between pf and brain activity is widely accepted but the specificity of cognitive functions affected by physical fitness across the adult lifespan is less understood. the present study aims to clarify whether pf is basically related to cognition and general intelligence in healthy adults, and whether higher levels of pf are associated with better performance in the same or different cognitive functions at different ages. methods: a sample of 490 participants (20-70 years) was analyzed to examine this relationship. later, the sample was split half into the young to middle-aged group (ym; 20-45 years; n = 254), and the middleaged to older group (mo; 46-70 years; n = 236). pf was measured by a quotient of maximum power in a bicycle ergometry test pwc-130 divided by body weight (w/kg), which was supported by a self-reported level of pf. cognitive performance was evaluated by standardized neuropsychological test batteries. results: regression models showed a relationship between pf and general intelligence (g-factor) and its subcomponents extracted using structural equation modeling (sem) in the entire sample. this association was moderated by age, which also moderated some specific cognitive domains such as attention, logical reasoning, and interference processing. after splitting the sample into two age groups, a significant relationship was found between cognitive status, as assessed by the mini mental state examination (mmse), and pf in both age groups. however, apart from cognitive failures in daily life (cfq), no other association between pf and specific cognitive functions was found in the ym group. in contrast, several positive associations were observed in the mo group, such as with selective attention, verbal memory, working memory, logical reasoning, and interference processing. discussion: these findings show that middle-aged to older adults benefit more from pf than younger to middle-aged adults. the results are discussed in terms of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the cognitive effects of pf across the lifespan. clinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct05155397, identifier nct05155397.",AB_0491
"quantum optimal control includes a family of pulse-shaping algorithms that aim to unlock the full potential of a variety of quantum technologies. the quantum optimal control suite (quocs) unites experimental focus and model-based approaches in a unified framework. easy usage and installation presented here and the availability of various combinable optimization strategies is designed to improve the performance of many quantum technology platforms, such as color defects in diamond, superconducting qubits, atom-or ion-based quantum computers. it can also be applied to the study of more general phenomena in physics. in this paper, we describe the software and the toolbox of gradient -free and gradient-based algorithms. we then show how the user can connect it to their experiment. in addition, we provide illustrative examples where our optimization suite solves typical quantum optimal control problems, in both open-and closed-loop settings. integration into existing experimental control software is already provided for the experiment control software qudi (binder et al., 2017 [41]), and further extensions are investigated and highly encouraged. quocs is available from github, under apache license 2.0, and can be found on the pypi repository. program summary program title: quocs -quantum optimal control suite cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /wjjch757fk.1 developer's repository link: https://github .com /quantum -ocs /quocs licensing provisions: apache-2.0 programming language: python external routines: numpy [1], scipy [1], jax [2] nature of problem: quantum systems are typically controlled by time-dependent electromagnetic fields to perform a certain set of quantum operations. those operations may in turn provide building blocks for various quantum information processing tasks such as quantum computation, communication, simulation, sensing, and metrology. numerous control strategies exist to design and improve such operations [3]. while some strategies are constructed to target a rather specific problem with high efficiency, others are more general to solve a wide range of applications [4,5]. to access the different algorithms, one has to download different optimization suites with different input and output parameters, making them hard to compare and combine. to benefit from the variety of algorithms, we have devised a customizable and intuitive optimization suite that simultaneously provides access to some of the most popular quantum optimal control algorithms.solution method: we combine, in a unified framework, some of the frequently used optimal control algorithms which are the dressed chopped random basis method (dcrab) [6], and gradient ascent pulse engineering (grape) [7], with an extension to make use of automatic differentiation (ad) [8]. the software is able to connect to both models of quantum dynamics in simulations and real-time quantum experiments to perform open-and closed-loop optimization, respectively. with minimal knowledge of optimal control theory, the user can manage to run optimizations of quantum processes using a variety of additional features such as stopping criteria and drift compensation. logging and data management of the optimization progress and results are also handled by the suite. its modular structure allows for extensions that accommodate customized algorithms and can be implemented by the user straightforwardly. additional comments including unusual features: the connection to the experiments is performed by an extension that enables a direct integration to a laboratory control software qudi [9].references[1] t.e. oliphant, comput. sci. eng. 9 (2007) 10, http://www.scipy.org/.[2] j. bradbury, et al., jax: composable transformations of python+numpy programs, http://github .com / google /jax, 2018.[3] s. glaser, u. boscain, t. calarco, et al., eur. phys. j. d 69 (2015) 279.

"background: computational models of cell signaling networks are extremely useful tools for the exploration of underlying system behavior and prediction of response to various perturbations. by representing signaling cascades as executable boolean networks, the previously developed rxncon (reaction-contingency) formalism and associated python package enable accurate and scalable modeling of signal transduction even in large (thousands of components) biological systems. the models are split into reactions, which generate states, and contingencies, that impinge on reactions; this avoids the so-called combinatorial explosion of system size. boolean description of the biological system compensates for the poor availability of kinetic parameters which are necessary for quantitative models. unfortunately, few tools are available to support rxncon model development, especially for large, intricate systems. results: we present the kboolnet toolkit (https://github.com/kufalab-ucsd/kboolnet, complete documentation at https://github.com/kufalab-ucsd/kboolnet/wiki), an r package and a set of scripts that seamlessly integrate with the python-based rxncon software and collectively provide a complete workflow for the verification, validation, and visualization of rxncon models. the verification script verifymodel.r checks for responsiveness to repeated stimulations as well as consistency of steady state behavior. the validation scripts truthtable.r, sensitivityanalysis.r, and scorenet.r provide various readouts for the comparison of model predictions to experimental data. in particular, scorenet.r compares model predictions to a cloud-stored midas-format experimental database to provide a numerical score for tracking model accuracy. finally, the visualization scripts allow for graphical representations of model topology and behavior. the entire kboolnet toolkit is cloud-enabled, allowing for easy collaborative development; most scripts also allow for the extraction and analysis of individual user-defined modules. conclusion: the kboolnet toolkit provides a modular, cloud-enabled workflow for the development of rxncon models, as well as their verification, validation, and visualization. this will enable the creation of larger, more comprehensive, and more rigorous models of cell signaling using the rxncon formalism in the future.",AB_0491
"the accelerated deployment of service robots have spawned a number of algorithm variations to better handle real-world conditions. many local trajectory planning techniques have been deployed on practical robot systems successfully. while most formulations of dynamic window approach and model predictive control can progress along paths and optimize for additional criteria, the use of pure path tracking algorithms is still commonplace. decades later, pure pursuit and its variants continues to be one of the most commonly utilized classes of local trajectory planners. however, few pure pursuit variants have been proposed with schema for variable linear velocities-they either assume a constant velocity or fails to address the point at all. this paper presents a variant of pure pursuit designed with additional heuristics to regulate linear velocities, built atop the existing adaptive variant. the regulated pure pursuit algorithm makes incremental improvements on state of the art by adjusting linear velocities with particular focus on safety in constrained and partially observable spaces commonly negotiated by deployed robots. we present experiments with the regulated pure pursuit algorithm on industrial-grade service robots. we also provide a high-quality reference implementation that is freely included ros 2 nav2 framework at https:// github.com/ros-planning/navigation2 for fast evaluation.",AB_0491
"machine learning techniques are excellent to analyze expression data from single cells. these techniques impact all fields ranging from cell annotation and clustering to signature identification. the presented framework evaluates gene selection sets how far they optimally separate defined phenotypes or cell groups. this innovation overcomes the present limitation to objectively and correctly identify a small gene set of high information content regarding separating phenotypes for which corresponding code scripts are provided. the small but meaningful subset of the original genes (or feature space) facilitates human interpretability of the differences of the phenotypes including those found by machine learning results and may even turn correlations between genes and phenotypes into a causal explanation. for the feature selection task, the principal feature analysis is utilized which reduces redundant information while selecting genes that carry the information for separating the phenotypes. in this context, the presented framework shows explainability of unsupervised learning as it reveals cell-type specific signatures. apart from a seurat preprocessing tool and the pfa script, the pipeline uses mutual information to balance accuracy and size of the gene set if desired. a validation part to evaluate the gene selection for their information content regarding the separation of the phenotypes is provided as well, binary and multiclass classification of 3 or 4 groups are studied. results from different single-cell data are presented. in each, only about ten out of more than 30000 genes are identified as carrying the relevant information. the code is provided in a github repository at https://github.com/ac-phd/seurat_pfa_pipeline.& copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of research network of computational and structural biotechnology. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0491
"a complete declarative description of the computational environment is usually missing when researchers share their materials. without such description, software obsolescence and missing system components can jeopardize computational reproducibility in the future, even when data and computer code are available. the r package rang is a complete solution for generating the declarative description for other researchers to automatically reconstruct the computational environment at a specific time point. the reconstruction process, based on docker, has been tested for r code as old as 2001. the declarative description generated by rang satisfies the definition of a reproducible research compendium and can be shared as such. in this contribution, we show how rang can be used to make otherwise unexecutable code, spanning fields such as computational social science and bioinformatics, executable again. we also provide instructions on how to use rang to construct reproducible and shareable research compendia of current research. the package is currently available from cran (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rang/index.html) and github (https://github.com/chainsawriot/rang).",AB_0491
"introduction: adolescence is a period of vulnerability for emotion regulation and sleep difficulties, risks that might be compounded by intense covid-19 lockdowns and challenges. the aim of this study was to investigate how sleep quality related to emotion regulation difficulties in adolescents during lockdown in peru.methods: participants were 2563 adolescents enrolled in innova school in peru (11 - -17 years) in may 2020. hypotheses were derived from exploring one half of the sample, preregistered at https://osf.io/fuetz/, and then confirmed in the second half of the sample. participants completed subjective surveys of sleep quality (short psqi) and the difficulties in emotion regulation scale short form (ders-sf).results: worse sleep quality was robustly associated with more difficulties in emotion regulation across both samples. the association was found particularly for emotion regulation subscales related to the ability to engage in goal directed behavior in the face of distress, emotional clarity and strategies to deal with feeling distressed. in contrast, there was no robust association between sleep and the ability to regulate impulses in the context of negative emotions, and no association with the ability to accept emotions. girls and older adolescents robustly endorsed worse sleep quality and more difficulties in emotion regulation.limitations: the cross-sectional nature of this study prevents us from determining the direction of the association. data were collected using adolescent self-report which, while informative of adolescent perceptions, might diverge from objective measures of sleep or emotion regulation difficulties.conclusions: our findings with adolescents in peru contribute to our understanding of the association between sleep and emotion regulation at a broader global scale.",AB_0491
