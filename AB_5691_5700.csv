"background: depression is common among adults who smoke cigarettes. existing depression-specific cessation interventions have limited reach and are unlikely to improve smoking prevalence rates among this large subgroup of smokers. objective: this study aimed to determine whether a mobile app-based intervention tailored for depression paired with a mailed sample of nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) is efficacious for treating depression and promoting smoking cessation. methods: a 2-arm nationwide remote randomized clinical trial was conducted in the united states. adults (n=150) with elevated depressive symptoms (patient health questionnaire-8 >= 10) who smoked were enrolled. the mobile app (goal2quit) provided behavioral strategies for treating depression and quitting smoking based on behavioral activation treatment for depression. goal2quit participants also received a 2-week sample of combination nrt. treatment as usual participants received a self-help booklet for quitting smoking that was not tailored for depression. primary end points included goal2quit usability, change in depression (beck depression inventory-ii) across 12 weeks, and smoking cessation including reduction in cigarettes per day, incidence of 24-hour quit attempts, floating abstinence, and 7-day point prevalence abstinence (ppa). results: in total, 150 participants were enrolled between june 25, 2020, and february 23, 2022, of which 80 were female (53.3%) and the mean age was 38.4 (sd 10.3) years. at baseline, participants on average reported moderate depressive symptoms and smoked a mean of 14.7 (sd 7.5) cigarettes per day. goal2quit usability was strong with a mean usability rating on the system usability scale of 78.5 (sd 16.9), with 70% scoring above the >= 68 cutoff for above-average usability. retention data for app use were generally strong immediately following trial enrollment and declined in subsequent weeks. those who received goal2quit and the nrt sample reported lower mean depressive symptoms over the trial duration as compared to treatment as usual (difference of mean 3.72, se 1.37 points less; p=.01). across time points, all cessation outcomes favored goal2quit. regarding abstinence, goal2quit participants reported significantly higher rates of 7-day ppa at weeks 4 (11% vs 0%; p=.02), 8 (7-day ppa: 12% vs 0%; p=.02), and 12 (16% vs 2%; p=.02). conclusions: a mobile app intervention tailored for depression paired with a sample of nrt was effective for depression treatment and smoking cessation. findings support the utility of this intervention approach for addressing the currently unmet public health treatment need for tailored, scalable depression-specific cessation treatments. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct03837379; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03837379",AB_0570

"background: ipaa aims to restore continence to patients after total proctocolectomy. however, some patients have inadequate small-bowel mesenteric length to achieve reconstruction. no preoperative risk stratification tools of native anatomy exist. objective: we report ct-guided measurements of anatomic landmarks to predict nonreach before ipaa. design: this is a single-institution retrospective analysis of a prospective database. setting: this study was conducted at cedars-sinai between january 2007 and december 2021. patients: patients with ibd undergoing a 2- or 3-stage ipaa with a preoperative abdominal ct using either an enterography protocol or iv contrast sufficient to visualize mesenteric vasculature were included in the study. ct mesenteric indices were assessed, including total length (representing length required for the pouch to reach the anal canal), mesenteric length (inherent length of small-bowel mesentery), and mobilization length (the difference between total length and mesenteric length). main outcome measures: the primary outcome was ipaa nonreach. the secondary outcomes were association of clinical variables and ct mesenteric indices. results: six of 59 patients (10%) experienced nonreach. mobilization length was longer in the nonreach group by 5.8cm (p = 0.01), and mesenteric length was shorter by 3.5cm (p = 0.04). mobilization length >= 17cm provided 100% sensitivity and 69% specificity (or 1.46, area under the curve 0.84, p = 0.004) for nonreach. similarly, a mesenteric length <14.6cm demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 49% specificity for ipaa nonreach (area under the curve 0.75, p = 0.03). limitations: the retrospective nature of the study precluded a standardized imaging protocol. external validation will be required because of the small sample size. conclusions: ct-based measurements of length, specifically mesenteric and mobilization length, predict nonreach before ipaa. this method is noninvasive, readily available, and may be useful for preoperative patient counseling and operative planning. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c140.d",AB_0570
"augmented reality (ar) tools have shown significant potential in providing on-site visualization of building information modeling (bim) data and models for supporting construction evaluation, inspection, and guidance. retrofitting existing buildings, however, remains a challenging task requiring more innovative solutions to successfully integrate ar and bim. this study aims to investigate the impact of ar+bim technology on the retrofitting training process and assess the potential for future on-site usage. we conducted a study with 64 non-expert participants, who were asked to perform a common retrofitting procedure of an electrical outlet installation using either an ar+bim system or a standard printed blueprint documentation set. our findings indicate that ar+bim reduced task time significantly and improved performance consistency across participants, while also decreasing the physical and cognitive demands of the training. this study provides a foundation for augmenting future retrofitting construction research that can extend the use of ar+bim technology, thus facilitating more efficient retrofitting of existing buildings. a video presentation of this article and all supplemental materials are available at https://github.com/designlabucf/senseable_retrofittingtraining.",AB_0570
"this paper investigates the accuracy of augmented reality (ar) technologies, particularly commercially available optical see-through displays, in depicting virtual content inside the human body for surgical planning. their inherent limitations result in inaccuracies in perceived object positioning. we examine how occlusion, specifically with opaque surfaces, affects perceived depth of virtual objects at arm's length working distances. a custom apparatus with a half-silvered mirror was developed, providing accurate depth cues excluding occlusion, differing from commercial displays. we carried out a study, contrasting our apparatus with a hololens 2, involving a depth estimation task under varied surface complexities and illuminations. in addition, we explored the effects of creating a virtual hole in the surface. subjects' depth estimation accuracy and confidence were a ssessed. results showed more depth estimation variation with hololens and significant depth error beneath complex occluding surfaces. however, creating a virtual hole significantly reduced depth errors and increased subjects' confidence, irrespective of accuracy enhancement. these findings have important implications for the design and use of mixed-reality technologies in surgical applications, and industrial applications such as using virtual content to guide maintenance or repair of components hidden beneath the opaque outer surface of equipment. a free copy of this paper and all supplemental materials are available at https://bit.ly/3ybkwju.",AB_0570
"testing machine learning software for ethical bias has become a pressing current concern. in response, recent research has proposed a plethora of new fairness metrics, for example, the dozens of fairness metrics in the ibm aif360 toolkit. this raises the question: how can any fairness tool satisfy such a diverse range of goals? while we cannot completely simplify the task of fairness testing, we can certainly reduce the problem. this article shows that many of those fairness metrics effectively measure the same thing. based on experiments using seven real-world datasets, we find that (a) 26 classification metrics can be clustered into seven groups and (b) four dataset metrics can be clustered into three groups. further, each reduced set may actually predict different things. hence, it is no longer necessary (or even possible) to satisfy all fairness metrics. in summary, to simplify the fairness testing problem, we recommend the following steps: (1) determine what type of fairness is desirable (and we offer a handful of such types), then (2) lookup those types in our clusters, and then (3) just test for one item per cluster. for the purpose of reproducibility, our scripts and data are available at https://github.com/repoanonymous/fairness_metrics.",AB_0570
"background: nonmetastatic t4b colon cancer has been traditionally treated with upfront surgery, often requiring technically challenging multiorgan resection. neoadjuvant chemotherapy can potentially downsize these tumors and improve their resectability. objective: this study aimed to explore trends and outcomes of neoadjuvant chemotherapy use compared to upfront surgery in patients with nonmetastatic t4b colon cancer. this study also sought to determine factors associated with increased neoadjuvant chemotherapy use and with overall survival. design: retrospective cohort study. settings: conducted using the national cancer database. patients: patients with nonmetastatic t4b colon cancer who underwent colectomy (2006-2016) were included in the study. patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy were propensity-matched (1:2) to those who underwent upfront surgery in either clinically node-negative or node-positive disease. main outcome measures: postoperative outcomes (length of stay, 30-d readmission, 30/90-d mortality), oncologic resection adequacy (r0 rate, number of resected/positive nodes), and overall survival were the main outcome measures. results: neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used in 7.7% of the patients. neoadjuvant chemotherapy use increased over the study period from 4% to 16% in the entire cohort, from 3% to 21% in patients with clinically node-positive disease, and from 6% to 12% in patients with clinically node-negative disease. factors associated with increased use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy included younger age (or 0.97; 95% ci, 0.96-0.98; p < 0.001), male sex (or 1.35; 95% ci, 1.11-1.64; p = 0.002), recent diagnosis year (or 1.16; 95% ci, 1.12-1.20; p < 0.001), academic centers (or 2.65; 95% ci, 2.19-3.22; p < 0.001), clinically node-positive (or 1.23; 95% ci, 1.01-1.49; p = 0.037), and tumor located in the sigmoid colon (or 2.44; 95% ci, 1.97-3.02; p < 0.001). patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy had significantly higher r0 resection compared with upfront surgery (87% vs 77%; p < 0.001). on multivariable analysis, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with higher overall survival (hr 0.76; 95% ci, 0.64-0.91; p = 0.002). on propensity-matched analyses, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a higher 5-year overall survival compared to upfront surgery in patients with clinically node-positive disease (57% vs 43%; p = 0.003) but not in patients with clinically node-negative disease (61% vs 56%; p = 0.090). limitations: retrospective design. conclusion: neoadjuvant chemotherapy use for nonmetastatic t4b has increased significantly on the national level, more so in patients with clinically node-positive disease. patients with node-positive disease treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy had higher overall survival compared to those who underwent upfront surgery. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c228. existe lugar para la terapia sistemica neoadyuvante para el cancer de colon ct4bm0?

"objective: to examine the developmental pathways through which the family bereavement program (fbp) reduces major depression and generalized anxiety disorder 15 years later.method: a randomized trial of the fbp included 5 assessments, at pretest, posttest (98% retention), and follow-ups at 11 months (90% retention), 6 years (89% retention), and 15 years (80% retention) following the program. participants included 244 children and adolescents (from 156 families) 8 to 16 years of age who were randomly assigned to the fbp (135 children/adolescents, 90 families), a 12-session program that included a caregiver component and a child/adolescent component or a literature comparison condition (109 children/adolescents, 66 families). in-home interviews assessed mediators directly targeted for change at post-test and 11 months (eg, parenting and coping); 6-year theoretical mediators (ie, internalizing problems, aversive views of the self) and 15-year children's/adolescents' major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. data analysis tested 3 path mediation models in which fbp effects at post-test and 11 months led to effects on 6-year theoretical mediators, which in turn lad to reductions in major depression and generalized anxiety disorder at 15 years.results: the fbp had a significant effect on reducing the prevalence of major depression (odds ratio 1/4 0.332, p < .01) at 15 years. significant 3-path mediation models found that multiple variables that were targeted by the caregiver and child components of the fbp at post-test and 11 months mediated fbp effects on depression at 15 years through their impact on aversive self-views and internalizing problems at 6 years. conclusion: the findings support the 15-year impact of the family bereavement program on major depression and for maintaining components of the fbp that affect aspects of parenting and children's coping, grief, and self-regulation as the program is disseminated. clinical trial registration information: 6-year follow-up of a prevention program for bereaved families; https://clinicaltrials.gov/; nct01008189.diversity & inclusion statement: we worked to ensure race, ethnic, and/or other types of diversity in the recruitment of human participants. we actively worked to promote sex and gender balance in our author group. one or more of the authors of this paper self-identifies as a member of one or more historically underrepresented racial and/or ethnic groups in science. we actively worked to promote inclusion of historically underrepresented racial and/or ethnic groups in science in our author group.",AB_0570
"dermoscopy is a noninvasive way to examine and diagnose skin lesions, e.g. nevus and melanoma, and is a critical step for skin cancer detection. accurate classification of dermoscopic images can detect skin cancer at an early stage and bring social and economic impact to patients and communities. using deep learning methods to classify dermoscopic images has shown superior performance, but existing research often overlooks the class imbalance in the data. in addition, although a handful of public datasets are available for skin cancer research, these datasets are generally not large enough for deep learning algorithms to produce accurate results. in this paper, we propose to use data augmentation and generative adversarial networks (gan) to tackle class-imbalanced dermoscopic image classification. our main objectives are to determine (1) how state-of-the-art fine-tuned deep learning models perform on class-imbalanced dermoscopic images, (2) whether data augmentation and gan can help alleviate class imbalances to improve classification accuracy, and (3) which method is more effective in addressing the class imbalance. by using public datasets and a carefully designed framework to generate augmented images and synthetic images, our research provides clear answers to these questions. code and data used in the study are available at: https://github.com/mjan2021/dermoscopic-image-classification.git",AB_0570
"the success of machine learning is, in part, due to a large volume of data available to train models. however, the amount of training data for structure-based molecular property prediction remains limited. the previously described crossdocked2020 data set expanded the available training data for binding pose classification in a molecular docking setting but did not address expanding the amount of receptor-ligand binding affinity data. we present experiments demonstrating that imputing binding affinity labels for complexes without experimentally determined binding affinities is a viable approach to expanding training data for structure-based models of receptor-ligand binding affinity. in particular, we demonstrate that utilizing imputed labels from a convolutional neural network trained only on the affinity data present in crossdocked2020 results in a small improvement in the binding affinity regression performance, despite the additional sources of noise that such imputed labels add to the training data. the code, data splits, and imputation labels utilized in this paper are freely available at https://github.com/francoep/imputationpaper.",AB_0570
