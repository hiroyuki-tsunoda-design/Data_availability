"background. chloroplast genomes are usually circular molecules, and most of them are tetrad structures with two inverted repeat (ir) regions, a large single-copy region, and a small single-copy region. ir contraction and expansion are among the genetic diversities during the evolution of plant chloroplast genomes. the only previously released tool for the visualization of junction sites of the regions does not consider the diversity of the starting point of genomes, which leads to incorrect results or even no results for the examination of ir contraction and expansion.results. in this work, a new tool named cpjsdraw was developed for visualizing the junction sites of chloroplast genomes. cpjsdraw can format the starting point of the irregular linearized genome, correct the junction sites of ir and single-copy regions, display the tetrad structure, visualize the junction sites of any number (>= 1) of chloroplast genomes, show the transcription direction of genes adjacent to junction sites, and indicate the ir expansion or contraction of chloroplast genomes.conclusions. cpjsdraw is a software that is universal and reliable in analysis and visualization of ir expansion or contraction of chloroplast genomes. cpjsdraw has more accurate analysis and more complete functions when compared with previously released tool. cpjsdraw as a perl package and tested data are available at http://dx.doi. org/10.5281/zenodo.7669480 for english users. in addition, an online version with a chinese interface is available at http://cloud.genepioneer.com:9929/#/tool/alltool/detail/ 335.",AB_0248
"the development of deep learning technology has brought great improvements to the field of time series forecasting. short sequence time-series forecasting no longer satisfies the current research community, and long-term future prediction is becoming the hotspot, which is noted as long sequence time-series forecasting (lstf). the lstf has been widely studied in the extant literature, but few reviews of its research development are reported. in this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of lstf studies with deep learning technology. we propose rigorous definitions of lstf and summarize the evolution in terms of a proposed taxonomy based on network structure. next, we discuss three key problems and corresponding solutions from long dependency modeling, computation cost, and evaluation metrics. in particular, we propose a kruskal-wallis test based evaluation method for evaluation metrics problems. we further synthesize the applications, datasets, and open -source codes of lstf. moreover, we conduct extensive case studies comparing the proposed kruskal-wallis test based evaluation method with existing metrics and the results demonstrate the effectiveness. finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field. all resources and codes are assembled and organized under a unified framework that is available online at https://github.com/masterleia/tsf_lstf_ compare.",AB_0248
"introduction: an emerging approach using promoter tiling deletion via genome editing is beginning to become popular in plants. identifying the precise positions of core motifs within plant gene promoter is of great demand but they are still largely unknown. we previously developed tsptfbs of 265 arabidopsis transcription factor binding sites (tfbss) prediction models, which now cannot meet the above demand of identifying the core motif. methods: here, we additionally introduced 104 maize and 20 rice tfbs datasets and utilized densenet for model construction on a large-scale dataset of a total of 389 plant tfs. more importantly, we combined three biological interpretability methods including deeplift, in-silico tiling deletion, and in-silico mutagenesis to identify the potential core motifs of any given genomic region. results: for the results, densenet not only has achieved greater predictability than baseline methods such as ls-gkm and meme for above 389 tfs from arabidopsis, maize and rice, but also has greater performance on trans-species prediction of a total of 15 tfs from other six plant species. a motif analysis based on tf-modisco and global importance analysis (gia) further provide the biological implication of the core motif identified by three interpretability methods. finally, we developed a pipeline of tsptfbs 2.0, which integrates 389 densenet-based models of tf binding and the above three interpretability methods. discussion: tsptfbs 2.0 was implemented as a user-friendly web-server (http:// www.hzau-hulab.com/tsptfbs/), which can support important references for editing targets of any given plant promoters and it has great potentials to provide reliable editing target of genetic screen experiments in plants.",AB_0248
"the saliency prediction precision has improved rapidly with the development of deep learning technology, but the inference speed is slow due to the continuous deepening of networks. hence, this paper proposes a fast saliency prediction model. concretely, the siamese network backbone based on tailored efficientnetv2 accelerates the inference speed while maintaining high performance. the shared parameters strategy further curbs parameter growth. furthermore, we add multi-channel activation maps to optimize the fine features considering different channels and low-level visual features, which improves the interpretability of the model. extensive experiments show that the proposed model achieves competitive performance on the standard benchmark datasets, and prove the effectiveness of our method in striking a balance between prediction accuracy and inference speed. moreover, the small model size allows our method to be applied in edge devices. the code is available at: https://github.com/lscumt/fast-fixation-prediction.",AB_0248
"the complex and changeable inland river scenes resulting out of frequent occlusions of ships in the available tracking methods are not accurate enough to estimate the motion state of the target ship leading to object tracking drift or even loss. in view of this, an attempt is made to propose a robust online learning ship tracking algorithm based on the siamese network and the region proposal network. firstly, the algorithm combines the off-line siamese network classification score and the online classifier score for discriminative learning, and establishes an occlusion determination mechanism according to the classification the fusion score. when the target is in the occlusion state, the target template is not updated, and the global search mechanism is activated to relocate the target, thereby avoiding object tracking drift. secondly, an efficient adaptive online update strategy, updatenet, is introduced to improve the template degradation in the tracking process. finally, on comparing the state-of-the-art tracking algorithms on the inland river ship datasets, the experimental results of the proposed algorithm show strong robustness in occlusion scenarios with an accuracy and success rate of 56.8% and 57.2% respectively. supportive source codes for this research are publicly available at https://github.com/libra-jing/siamol.",AB_0248
"aerial photography is a long-range, non-contact method of target detection technology that enables qualitative or quantitative analysis of the target. however, aerial photography images generally have certain chromatic aberration and color distortion. therefore, effective segmentation of aerial images can further enhance the feature information and reduce the computational difficulty for subsequent image processing. in this paper, we propose an improved version of golden jackal optimization, which is dubbed helper mechanism based golden jackal optimization (hgjo), to apply multilevel threshold segmentation to aerial images. the proposed method uses opposition-based learning to boost population diversity. and a new approach to calculate the prey escape energy is proposed to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm. in addition, the cauchy distribution is introduced to adjust the original update scheme to enhance the exploration capability of the algorithm. finally, a novel helper mechanism is designed to improve the performance for escape the local optima. to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we use the cec2022 benchmark function test suite to perform comparison experiments. the hgjo is compared with the original gjo and five classical meta-heuristics. the experimental results show that hgjo is able to achieve competitive results in the benchmark test set. finally, all of the algorithms are applied to the experiments of variable threshold segmentation of aerial images, and the results show that the aerial photography images segmented by hgjo beat the others. noteworthy, the source code of hgjo is publicly available at https://github.com/ vang-z/hgjo.",AB_0248
"spectral super-resolution (ssr) is a very important technique to obtain hyperspectral images from only rgb images, which can effectively overcome the high acquisition cost and low spatial resolution of hyperspectral imaging. from linear interpolation to sparse recovery, spectral super-resolution have gained rapid development. in the past five years, as deep learning has taken off in various computer vision tasks, spectral super-resolution algorithms based on deep learning have also exploded. from residual learning to physical modeling, deep learning-based models used in spectral super-resolution is multifarious. this paper has collected almost all deep learning-based ssr algorithms and reviewed them according to their main contributions, involving network architecture, feature extraction, and physical modeling. this paper proposed a benchmark about deep learning-based spectral super-resolution algorithms: https://github.com/jianghe96/dl4ssr, and besides spectral recovery, their potential in colorization and spectral compressive imaging is also systematically discussed. furthermore, we presented our views about challenges and possible further trends of deep learning-based ssr. light-weight model architecture with generalization is crucial to in-camera processing. model robustness should be considered carefully to manage data with various degradation. finally, multi-task ssr meets the multiple needs of humans and meanwhile achieves inter-task mutual improvement, including low-level with low-level, low-level with high-level, and data reconstruction with parameter inversion.",AB_0248
"colorectal cancer is one of the malignant tumors with the highest mortality due to the lack of obvious early symptoms. it is usually in the advanced stage when it is discovered. thus the automatic and accurate classification of early colon lesions is of great significance for clinically estimating the status of colon lesions and formulating appropriate diagnostic programs. however, it is challenging to classify full-stage colon lesions due to the large inter-class similarities and intra-class differences of the images. in this work, we propose a novel dual-branch lesion-aware neural network (dlgnet) to classify intestinal lesions by exploring the intrinsic relationship between diseases, composed of four modules: lesion location module, dual-branch classification module, attention guidance module, and inter-class gaussian loss function. specifically, the elaborate dual-branch module integrates the original image and the lesion patch obtained by the lesion localization module to explore and interact with lesion-specific features from a global and local perspective. also, the feature-guided module guides the model to pay attention to the disease-specific features by learning remote dependencies through spatial and channel attention after network feature learning. finally, the inter-class gaussian loss function is proposed, which assumes that each feature extracted by the network is an independent gaussian distribution, and the inter-class clustering is more compact, thereby improving the discriminative ability of the network. the extensive experiments on the collected 2568 colonoscopy images have an average accuracy of 91.50%, and the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods. this study is the first time that colon lesions are classified at each stage and achieves promising colon disease classification performance. to motivate the community, we have made our code publicly available via https://github.com/soleilssss/dlgnet.",AB_0248
"many signaling and other genes known as hidden drivers may not be genetically or epigenetically altered or differentially expressed at the mrna or protein levels, but, rather, drive a phenotype such as tumorigenesis via post-translational modification or other mechanisms. however, conventional approaches based on genomics or differential expression are limited in exposing such hidden drivers. here, we present a comprehensive algorithm and toolkit netbid2 (data-driven network-based bayesian inference of drivers, version 2), which reverse-engineers context-specific interactomes and integrates network activity inferred from large-scale multi-omics data, empowering the identification of hidden drivers that could not be detected by traditional analyses. netbid2 has substantially re-engineered the previous prototype version by providing versatile data visualization and sophisticated statistical analyses, which strongly facilitate researchers for result interpretation through end-to-endmulti-omics data analysis. we demonstrate the power of netbid2 using three hidden driver examples. we deploy netbid2 viewer, runner, and cloud apps with 145 context-specific gene regulatory and signaling networks across normal tissues and paediatric and adult cancers to facilitate end-to-end analysis, real-time interactive visualization and cloud-ased data sharing. netbid2 is freely available at https://jyyulab.github.io/ netbid.",AB_0248
"deciphering cell-type-specific 3d structures of chromatin is challenging. here, we present inferloop, a novel method for inferring the strength of chromatin interaction using single-cell chromatin accessibility data. the workflow of inferloop is, first, to conduct signal enhancement by grouping nearby cells into bins, and then, for each bin, leverage accessibility signals for loop signals using a newly constructed metric that is similar to the perturbation of the pearson correlation coefficient. in this study, we have described three application scenarios of inferloop, including the inference of cell-type-specific loop signals, the prediction of gene expression levels and the interpretation of intergenic loci. the effectiveness and superiority of inferloop over other methods in those three scenarios are rigorously validated by using the single-cell 3d genome structure data of human brain cortex and human blood, the single-cell multi-omics data of human blood and mouse brain cortex, and the intergenic loci in the gwas catalog database as well as the gtex database, respectively. in addition, inferloop can be applied to predict loop signals of individual spots using the spatial chromatin accessibility data of mouse embryo. inferloop is available at https://github.com/jumphone/inferloop.",AB_0248
