"in today's digital world, automated sentiment analysis from online reviews can contribute to a wide variety of decision-making processes. one example is examining typical perceptions of a product based on customer feedbacks to have a better understanding of consumer expectations, which can help enhance everything from customer service to product offerings. online review comments, on the other hand, frequently mix different languages, use non-native scripts and do not adhere to strict grammar norms. for a low-resource language like bangla, the lack of annotated code-mixed data makes automated sentiment analysis more challenging. to address this, we collect online reviews of different products and construct an annotated bangla-english code mix (be-cm) dataset (dataset and other resources are available at https://github.com/fokhruli/cm-seti-anlysis). on our sentiment corpus, we also compare several alternative models from the existing literature. we present a simple but effective data augmentation method that can be utilized with existing word embedding algorithms without the need for a parallel corpus to improve cross-lingual contextual understanding. our experimental results suggest that training word embedding models (e.g., word2vec, fasttext) with our data augmentation strategy can help the model in capturing the cross-lingual relationship for code-mixed sentences, thereby improving the overall performance of existing classifiers in both supervised learning and zero-shot cross-lingual adaptability. with extensive experimentations, we found that xgboost with fasttext embedding trained on our proposed data augmentation method outperforms other alternative models in automated sentiment analysis on code-mixed bangla-english dataset, with a weighted f1 score of 87%.",AB_0415
"colorectal cancer occurs in the rectal of humans, and early detection has been proved to reduce its mortality rate. colonoscopy is the standard used in detecting the presence of polyps in the rectal, and accurate segmentation of the polyps from colonoscopy images often provides helpful information for early diagnosis and treatment. although existing deep learning models often achieve high segmentation performance when tested on the same dataset used in model training; still, their performance often degrades when applied to out-of-distribution datasets, leading to low model generalization or overfitting. this challenge is often associated with the quality of the features learnt from the input images. in this work, a novel context feature refinement (cfr) module is proposed to address the challenge of low model generalization and segmentation performance. the cfr module is built to extract contextual information from the incoming feature map by using multiple parallel convolutional layers with progressively increasing kernel sizes. using multiple parallel convolutions with different kernel sizes helped to extract more efficient multi-scale contextual information and thus enabled the network to effectively identify and segment small and fine details, as well as larger and more complex structures in the input images. extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets in cvc-clinicdb, kvasir-seg, and bkai-neopolyp showed that the proposed convsegnet model achieved jaccard, dice and f2 scores of 0.8650, 0.9177, and 0.9328 on cvc-clinicdb, 0.7936, 0.8618, and 0.8855 on kvasir-seg, and 0.8045, 0.8747 and 0.8909 on bkai-neopolyp datasets respectively. also, an improved generalization performance was achieved by the convsegnet model, compared to the benchmark polyp segmentation models. code is available at https://github.com/aoige/convsegnet.",AB_0415
"developing a high-performance text classification model in a low-resource language is challenging due to the lack of labeled data. meanwhile, collecting large amounts of labeled data is cost-inefficient. one approach to increase the amount of labeled data is to create synthetic data using data augmentation techniques. however, most of the available data augmentation techniques work on english data and are highly language-dependent as they perform at the word and sentence level, such as replacing some words or paraphrasing a sentence. we present language-independent data augmentation (lida), a technique that utilizes a multilingual language model to create synthetic data from the available training dataset. unlike other methods, our approach worked on the sentence embedding level independent of any particular language. we evaluated lida in three languages on various fractions of the dataset, and the result showed improved performance in both the lstm and bert models. furthermore, we conducted an ablation study to determine the impact of the components in our method on overall performance. the source code of lida is available at https://github.com/yest/lida.",AB_0415
"background: endometrial ablation is a safe and effective minimally invasive surgical procedure. despite the high success rate of endometrial ablation for heavy uterine bleeding management, some patients experience persistent symptoms after the procedure, ne-cessitating a hysterectomy. the aim of this study is to determine the pre-operative clinical predictive factors of failure of endometrial ablation in the management of uterine bleeding. methods: retrospective cohort study of endometrial ablation procedures performed for treating heavy uterine bleeding. results: ninety five patients were included in the study. the failure rate was 24.2%. there was a statistically significant association between ablation failure and fluid deficit (p = 0.002) and intra-operative blood loss (p = 0.047). there was a statistically significant moderate association between adenomyosis (p = 0.003, (p = 0.37) and failed endometrial ablation. however, the age, body mass index (bmi), parity, number of miscarriages, number of cesarean sections, uterine length, endometrial thickness and procedure duration had no significant association with endometrial ablation. there was no significant relationship between the uterine abnormalities in general and the outcome of the endometrial ablation (p = 0.637). however, patients with combined adenomyosis and dysmenorrhea had a statistically significant association with outcome of the endometrial ablation (p = 0.016, (p = 0.28) and were more likely to have a failed endometrial ablation (crude odds ratio (cor) = 4.67, 95% confidence interval (ci), 1.35-16.09). logistic regres-sion to adjust for related factors revealed that the adenomyosis (adjusted odds ratio (aor) = 50.83, 95% ci, 3.64-706.75, p = 0.003) and fluid deficit (aor = 1.003, 95% ci, 1.000-1.006, p = 0.044) had a higher likelihood of an unsuccessful outcome. hysterectomy was performed in 47.8% of patients who had failure of the ablation. conclusions: among pre-operative factors, adenomyosis, fluid deficit and combined adenomyosis and dysmenorrhea were found to predict failure of hysteroscopic endometrial ablation. clinical trial registration: it was registered in https://www.clinicaltrials.gov database with identifier: nct05483348.",AB_0415
"vehicle speed estimation is one of the most critical issues in intelligent transportation system (its) research, while defining distance and identifying direction have become an inseparable part of vehicle speed estimation. despite the success of traditional and deep learning approaches in estimating vehicle speed, the high cost of deploying hardware devices to get all related sensor data, such as infrared/ultrasonic devices, global positioning systems (gps), light detection and ranging (lidar systems), and magnetic devices, has become the key barrier to improvement in previous studies. in this paper, our proposed model consists of two main components: 1) a vehicle detection and tracking component - this module is designed for creating reliable detection and tracking every specific object without doing calibration; 2) homography transformation regression network - this module has a function to solve occlusion issues and estimate vehicle speed accurately and efficiently. experimental results on two datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by reducing the mean square error (mse) metric from 14.02 to 6.56 based on deep learning approaches. we have announced our test code and model on github with https://github.com/ervinyo/speed-estimation-using-homography-transformation-and-regression-network.",AB_0415
"background: the philippines ranks 10th in tuberculosis prevalence worldwide. aside from pulmonary tuberculosis, gi tuberculosis remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in endemic areas. objective: this study aimed to describe the clinicopathologic profile and surgical outcomes of patients with gi tuberculosis. design: retrospective descriptive study. setting: department of surgery at the philippine general hospital, manila, philippines. patients: this study included all newly diagnosed cases of gi tuberculosis from january 1, 2009, to december 31, 2019. main outcome measures: clinical response to surgery. results: a total of 241 confirmed new cases were managed during an 11-year period. of these, 208 patients (86.30%) underwent outright surgery, whereas the remaining patients (13.69%) received antituberculous therapy. fifteen medically managed patients eventually required surgery, bringing the total surgically managed patients to 223. the patients' age ranged from 19 to 72 years, with a 1.9:1 male to female ratio. the most common complaint was abdominal pain. intestinal obstruction was the most common indication for surgery. a right hemicolectomy was the most often performed procedure, with the ileocecal area as the most frequently involved segment. the most common histopathologic findings were epithelioid granuloma and caseation necrosis. postoperative length of stay ranged from 0 to 59 days (mean, 7 days). morbidity rate was 5.38% and mortality rate was 3.14%. four deaths were operative and resulted from septic shock because of hollow viscus perforation. limitations: this study was limited to histopathologic basis for diagnosis. conclusion: the recommended initial therapy for all forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis is a 6-month regimen of antituberculous therapy unless the organisms are known or suspected to be resistant to first-line drugs. surgery is reserved for complications of intra-abdominal tuberculosis: obstruction, perforation, or severe bleeding. timely surgical intervention, coupled with medical management led to the best outcomes for these patients. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c56.",AB_0415
"background: the current characterization of patients with refractory or unexplained chronic cough (rcc and ucc, respectively) primarily stems from relatively small clinical studies. objective: to report the baseline medical history and clinical characteristics of individuals with rcc or ucc who were enrolled in cough-1 and cough-2, 2 large, global, phase 3 trials of gefapixant, a p2 & pound; 3-receptor antagonist. methods: adults with a chronic cough lasting for more than 1 year, diagnosis of rcc or ucc, and score greater than 40 mm on a 100-mm cough severity visual analog scale at both screening and baseline were eligible for enrollment. demographics, medical history, and cough characteristics were collected at baseline. cough-related measures included objective cough frequency, cough severity visual analog scale, leicester cough questionnaire, and hull airway reflux questionnaire. the data were summarized using descriptive statistics. results: of 2044 participants, 75% were women; mean age was 58 years, and mean cough duration was approxi-mately 11 years. among all participants, 73% were previously diagnosed with asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or upper airway cough syndrome. the mean leicester cough questionnaire total score was 10.4, with domain scores reflecting impaired cough-specific quality of life across physical, psychological, and social domains. the mean hull airway reflux questionnaire score was 39.6, with some of the most burdensome reported items being consistent with features of cough-reflex hypersensitivity. participant characteristics and cough burden were comparable across geographic regions. conclusion: participants with rcc or ucc had characteristics consistent with published demographics associ-ated with chronic cough. these data reflect a global population with burdensome cough of long duration and substantial impairment to quality of life. clinical trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifiers: cough-1, nct03449134 (https://www.clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/nct03449134); cough-2, nct03449147 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03449147). & copy; 2022 american college of allergy, asthma & immunology. published by elsevier inc.",AB_0415
"due to their flexibility and superior performance, machine learning models frequently complement and outperform traditional statistical survival models. however, their widespread adoption is hindered by a lack of user-friendly tools to explain their internal operations and prediction rationales. to tackle this issue, we introduce the survex r package, which provides a cohesive framework for explaining any survival model by applying explainable artificial intelligence techniques. the capabilities of the proposed software encompass understanding and diagnosing survival models, which can lead to their improvement. by revealing insights into the decision-making process, such as variable effects and importances, survex enables the assessment of model reliability and the detection of biases. thus, transparency and responsibility may be promoted in sensitive areas, such as biomedical research and healthcare applications. availability and implementation: survex is available under the gpl3 public license at https://github.com/modeloriented/survex and on cran with documentation available at https://modeloriented.github.io/survex.",AB_0415

"backgroundnumerous tools exist for biological sequence comparisons and search. one case of particular interest for immunologists is finding matches for linear peptide t cell epitopes, typically between 8 and 15 residues in length, in a large set of protein sequences. both to find exact matches or matches that account for residue substitutions. the utility of such tools is critical in applications ranging from identifying conservation across viral epitopes, identifying putative epitope targets for allergens, and finding matches for cancer-associated neoepitopes to examine the role of tolerance in tumor recognition.resultswe defined a set of benchmarks that reflect the different practical applications of short peptide sequence matching. we evaluated a suite of existing methods for speed and recall and developed a new tool, pepmatch. the tool uses a deterministic k-mer mapping algorithm that preprocesses proteomes before searching, achieving a 50-fold increase in speed over methods such as the basic local alignment search tool (blast) without compromising recall. pepmatch's code and benchmark datasets are publicly available.conclusionspepmatch offers significant speed and recall advantages for peptide sequence matching. while it is of immediate utility for immunologists, the developed benchmarking framework also provides a standard against which future tools can be evaluated for improvements. the tool is available at https://nextgen-tools.iedb.org, and the source code can be found at https://github.com/iedb/pepmatch.",AB_0415
