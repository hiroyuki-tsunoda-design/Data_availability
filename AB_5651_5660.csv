"explainable artificial intelligence is a recent research direction that aims to explain the results of the deep learning model. however, many recent research need to go into depth in evaluating the effective-ness of deep learning models in classifying image objects. for that reason, the research proposes two stages in the process of applying explainable artificial intelligence, including: (1) assessing the accuracy of the deep learning model through evaluation methods, (2) using grad-cam for model interpretation aims to evaluate the feature detection ability of an image when recognized by deep learning models. the deep learning models included in the evaluation included vgg16, resnet50, resnet50v2, xception, efficientnetv2, incep-tionv3, densenet201, mobilenetv2, mobilenet, nasnetmobile, regnetx002, and inceptionresnetv2 on our updated vegnet dataset is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/enalis/tomatoes-dataset. the results show that the mobienet model has high accuracy but less reliability than efficientnetv2s and xception. however, mobilenetv2's accuracy is the highest when considering the ratio match rate. the research results contribute to the construction of intelligent agricultural support systems (using automatic fruit-picking robots, removing poor-quality fruits,...) from the results of the explainable ai model to be able to use the optimal deep learning model in processing.",AB_0566
"this paper addresses the few-shot image classification problem, where the classification task is performed on unlabeled query samples given a small amount of labeled support samples only. one major challenge of the few-shot learning problem is the large variety of object visual appearances that prevents the support samples to represent that object comprehensively. this might result in a significant difference between support and query samples, therefore undermining the performance of few-shot algorithms. in this paper, we tackle the problem by proposing few-shot cosine transformer (fs-ct), where the relational map between supports and queries is effectively obtained for the few-shot tasks. the fs-ct consists of two parts, a learnable prototypical embedding network to obtain categorical representations from support samples with hard cases, and a transformer encoder to effectively achieve the relational map from two different support and query samples. we introduce cosine attention, a more robust and stable attention module that enhances the transformer module significantly and therefore improves fs-ct performance from 5% to over 20% in accuracy compared to the default scaled dot-product mechanism. our method performs competitive results in mini -imagenet, cub-200, and cifar-fs on 1-shot learning and 5-shot learning tasks across backbones and few-shot configurations. we also developed a custom few-shot dataset for yoga pose recognition to demonstrate the potential of our algorithm for practical application. our fs-ct with cosine attention is a lightweight, simple few-shot algorithm that can be applied for a wide range of applications, such as healthcare, medical, and security surveillance. the official implementation code of our few-shot cosine transformer is available at https://github.com/vinuni-vishc/few-shot-cosine-transformer.",AB_0566
"this paper explores the potential for making the use of 3rd generation partnership project (3gpp) service enabler architecture layer (seal) ts 23.434 even easier and more automatic in various industry verticals applying robot operating system 2 (ros2) for their operation. the proposed solution involves implementing a mapping node that converts ros2 settings to 3gpp seal requests and an information collecting proxy node. we evaluate the proposed method in various scenarios and deployments, including a novel deployment option that improves the network's action radius and an aid to overcome some limitations of current network deployments. we cover three seal functionalities: group management, network resource management (nrm), network monitoring and provide a solution that automatically maps ros2 application layer information elements to seal requests, requiring the ros2 application developer need only to tag the ros2 topics for the special quality of service (qos) handling. we demonstrate the feasibility and light-weight nature of the proposed solution. the code of ros2 nodes is open-sourced and can be found at: (https://github.com/ericsson/ros2-3gppsa6-mapper). the demo video of the proposed system in action can be seen at: (https://youtu.be/jxgahvdsu4o).",AB_0566
"multispectral imaging (msi) collects a datacube of spatio-spectral information of a scene. many acquisition methods for spectral imaging use scanning, preventing its widespread usage for dynamic scenes. on the other hand, the conventional color filter array (cfa) method often used to sample color images has also been extended to snapshot msi using a multispectral filter array (msfa), which is a mosaic of selective spectral filters placed over the focal plane array (fpa). however, even state-ofthe- art msfas coding patterns produce artifacts and distortions in the reconstructed spectral images, which might be due to the nonoptimal distribution of the spectral filters. to reduce the appearance of artifacts and provide tools for the optimal design of msfas, this paper proposes a novel mathematical framework to design msfas using a sphere packing (sp) approach. by assuming that each sampled filter can be represented by a sphere within the discrete datacube, sp organizes the position of the equal-size and disjoint spheres's centers in a cubic container. our method is denoted multispectral filter array by optimal sphere packing (msfa-osp), which seeks filter positions that maximize the minimum distance between the spheres's centers. simulation results show an image quality improvement of up to 2 db and a remarkable boost in spectral similarity when using our proposed msfa design approach for a variety of reconstruction algorithms. moreover, msfa-osp notably reduces the appearance of false colors and zipper effect artifacts, often seen when using state-of-the-art demosaicking algorithms. experiments using synthetic and real data prove that the proposed msfa-osp outperforms state-of-the-art msfas in terms of spatial and spectral fidelity. the code that reproduces the figures of this article is available at https://github.com/nelson10/demosaickingmultispectral3dspherepacking.git.",AB_0566
"background: mobile health interventions are common in public health settings in africa, and our preliminary work showed that smartphones are increasing in south africa. we developed a novel smartphone app-careconekta-that used gps location data to characterize personal mobility to improve engagement in hiv care among pregnant and postpartum women living with hiv in south africa. the app also used the user's location to map nearby clinics. objective: we aimed to describe the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of using the app in a real-world setting.methods: we conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial at a public sector clinic near cape town, south africa. we enrolled 200 pregnant (third trimester) women living with hiv who owned a smartphone that met the required specifications. all participants installed the app, designed to collect 2 gps heartbeats per day to geolocate the participant within a random 1-km fuzzy radius (for privacy). we randomized (1:1) participants to a control arm to receive the app with no additional support or an intervention arm to receive supportive phone calls, whatsapp (meta platforms, inc) messages, or both from the study team when traveling >50 km from the study area for >7 days. in addition to mobility data collected daily through the phone, participants completed questionnaires at enrollment and follow-up (approximately 6 months post partum).results: a total of 7 participants were withdrawn at enrollment or shortly after because of app installation failure (6/200, 3%) or changing to an unsuitable phone (1/200, 0.50%). during the study period, no participant's smartphone recorded at least 1 heartbeat per day, which was our primary feasibility measure. of the 171 participants who completed follow-up, only half (91/171, 53.2%) reported using the same phone as that used at enrollment, with the careconekta app still installed on the phone and gps usually enabled. the top reasons reported for the lack of heartbeat data were not having mobile data, uninstalling the app, and no longer having a smartphone. acceptability measures were positive, but participants at follow-up demonstrated a lack of understanding of the app's purpose and function. the clinic finder was a popular feature. owing to the lack of consistent gps heartbeats throughout the study, we were unable to assess the efficacy of the intervention.conclusions: several key challenges impeded our study feasibility. although the app was designed to reverse bill participants for any data use, the lack of mobile data was a substantial barrier to our study success. participants reported purchasing whatsapp data, which could not support the app. problems with the web-based dashboard meant that we could not consistently monitor mobility. our study provides important lessons about implementing an ambitious gps-based study under real-world conditions in a limited-resource setting.trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct03836625; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03836625international registered report identifier (irrid): rr2-10.1186/s13063-020-4190-x(jmir mhealth uhealth 2023;11:e44945) doi: 10.2196/44945",AB_0566
"this study addresses the human pose estimation problem on thermal images using convolutional neural networks and vision transformer architectures. to do this, eight human pose estimation methods designed for visible images were extended to be applied in the thermal domain. due to the lack of large, representative datasets containing labeled thermal images, this extension requires transfer learning between the visible and the thermal domain, and a database for fine-tuning the networks in the thermal domain. thus, it is proposed to train the networks using a grayscale version of the coco dataset, and then fine-tune them in the thermal domain. fine-tuning is carried out using the new uch-thermal-pose database presented in this work. this database includes 600 thermal images for training, 200 for validation, and 104 for testing, all of them fully labeled. moreover, in the paper, a comparative study of the eight extended deep-based methods for human pose detection is carried out. the uch-thermal-pose database is available at https://datos.uchile.cl/dataset.xhtml?persistentid=doi%3a10.34691%2fuchile%2f4b6na3, and the source code of all the methods is available athttps://github.com/jsmithdlc/thermal-human-pose-estimation.",AB_0566
"the development of deep learning-based biometric models that can be deployed on devices with constrained memory and computational resources has proven to be a significant challenge. previous approaches to this problem have not prioritized the reduction of feature map redundancy, but the introduction of ghost modules represents a major innovation in this area. ghost modules use a series of inexpensive linear transformations to extract additional feature maps from a set of intrinsic features, allowing for a more comprehensive representation of the underlying information. ghostnetv1 and ghostnetv2, both of which are based on ghost modules, serve as the foundation for a group of lightweight face recognition models called ghostfacenets. ghostnetv2 expands upon the original ghostnetv1 by adding an attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies. evaluation of ghostfacenets using various benchmarks reveals that these models offer superior performance while requiring a computational complexity of approximately 60-275 mflops. this is significantly lower than that of state-of-the-art (sota) big convolutional neural network (cnn) models, which can require hundreds of millions of flops. ghostfacenets trained with the arcface loss on the refined ms-celeb-1m dataset demonstrate sota performance on all benchmarks. in comparison to previous sota mobile cnns, ghostfacenets greatly improve efficiency for face verification tasks. the ghostfacenets code is available at: https://github.com/hamadya/ghostfacenets.",AB_0566
"asthma is a common, usually long-term respiratory disease with negative impact on global society and economy. treatment involves using medical devices (inhalers) that distribute medication to the airways and its efficiency depends on the precision of the inhalation technique. there is a clinical need for objective methods to assess the inhalation technique, during clinical consultation. integrated health monitoring systems, equipped with sensors, enable the recognition of drug actuation, embedded with sound signal detection, analysis and identification from intelligent structures, that could provide powerful tools for reliable content management. health monitoring systems equipped with sensors, embedded with sound signal detection, enable the recognition of drug actuation and could be used for effective audio content analysis. this paper revisits sound pattern recognition with machine learning techniques for asthma medication adherence assessment and presents the respiratory and drug actuation (rda) suite (https://gitlab.com/vvr/monitoring-medication-adherence/rda-benchmark) for benchmarking and further research. the rda suite includes a set of tools for audio processing, feature extraction and classification procedures and is provided along with a dataset, consisting of respiratory and drug actuation sounds. the classification models in rda are implemented based on conventional and advanced machine learning and deep networks' architectures. this study provides a comparative evaluation of the implemented approaches, examines potential improvements and discusses on challenges and future tendencies.",AB_0566
"background: hiv disproportionately affects men who have sex with men (msm). in malaysia, where stigma and discrimination toward msm are high, including in health care settings, mobile health (mhealth) platforms have the potential to open new frontiers in hiv prevention.objective: we developed an innovative, clinic-integrated smartphone app called jomprep, which provides a virtual platform for malaysian msm to engage in hiv prevention services. in collaboration with the local clinics in malaysia, jomprep offers a range of hiv prevention (ie, hiv testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis [prep]) and other support services (eg, referral to mental health support) without having to interface face to face with clinicians. this study evaluated the usability and acceptability of jomprep to deliver hiv prevention services for msm in malaysia.methods: in total, 50 prep-naive msm without hiv in greater kuala lumpur, malaysia, were recruited between march and april 2022. participants used jomprep for a month and completed a postuse survey. the usability of the app and its features were assessed using self-report and objective measures (eg, app analytics, clinic dashboard). acceptability was evaluated using the system usability scale (sus).results: the participants' mean age was 27.9 (sd 5.3) years. participants used jomprep for an average of 8 (sd 5.0) times during 30 days of testing, with each session lasting an average of 28 (sd 38.9) minutes. of the 50 participants, 42 (84%) ordered an hiv self-testing (hivst) kit using the app, of whom 18 (42%) ordered an hivst more than once. almost all participants (46/50, 92%) initiated prep using the app (same-day prep initiation: 30/46, 65%); of these, 16/46 (35%) participants chose prep e-consultation via the app (vs in-person consultation). regarding prep dispensing, 18/46 (39%) participants chose to receive their prep via mail delivery (vs pharmacy pickup). the app was rated as having high acceptability with a mean score of 73.8 (sd 10.1) on the sus.conclusions: jomprep was found to be a highly feasible and acceptable tool for msm in malaysia to access hiv prevention services quickly and conveniently. a broader, randomized controlled trial is warranted to evaluate its efficacy on hiv prevention outcomes among msm in malaysia.trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct05052411; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct05052411international registered report identifier (irrid): rr2-10.2196/43318 (jmir mhealth uhealth 2023;11:e44468) doi: 10.2196/44468",AB_0566
"this study validates a new spanish-language version of the coordinate response measure (crm) corpus using a well-established measure of spatial release from masking (srm). participants were 96 spanish-speaking young adults without hearing complaints in mexico city. to present the spanish-language srm test, we created new recordings of the crm with spanish-language translations and updated the freely available app (part; https://ucrbraingamecenter.github.io/part_utilities/) to present materials in spanish. in addition to srm, we collected baseline data on a battery of non-speech auditory assessments, including detection of frequency modulations, temporal gaps, and modulated broadband noise in the temporal, spectral, and spectrotemporal domains. data demonstrate that the newly developed speech and non-speech tasks show similar reliability to an earlier report in english-speaking populations. this study demonstrates an approach by which auditory assessment for clinical and basic research can be extended to spanish-speaking populations for whom testing platforms are not currently available. vc 2023 author(s). all article content, except where otherwise noted, is licensed under a creative commons attribution (cc by) license ().",AB_0566
