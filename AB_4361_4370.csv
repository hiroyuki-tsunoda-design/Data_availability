"motivation in consensus clustering, a clustering algorithm is used in combination with a subsampling procedure to detect stable clusters. previous studies on both simulated and real data suggest that consensus clustering outperforms native algorithms.results we extend here consensus clustering to allow for attribute weighting in the calculation of pairwise distances using existing regularized approaches. we propose a procedure for the calibration of the number of clusters (and regularization parameter) by maximizing the sharp score, a novel stability score calculated directly from consensus clustering outputs, making it extremely computationally competitive. our simulation study shows better clustering performances of (i) approaches calibrated by maximizing the sharp score compared to existing calibration scores and (ii) weighted compared to unweighted approaches in the presence of features that do not contribute to cluster definition. application on real gene expression data measured in lung tissue reveals clear clusters corresponding to different lung cancer subtypes.availability and implementation the r package sharp (version >= 1.4.3) is available on cran at https://cran.r-project.org/package=sharp. graphical abstract in consensus weighted clustering, the cosa algorithm is applied on multiple subsamples of the data with different regularisation parameters. a co-membership matrix can be obtained by applying a distance-based clustering algorithm (e.g. hierarchical clustering) with a given number of clusters on each of these weighted distance matrices. the consensus matrix is then calculated by aggregating all co-membership matrices over the subsamples for a given regularisation parameter and number of clusters. we propose to calibrate jointly these two hyper-parameters by maximising the sharp score.",AB_0437
"background: asthma exacerbation frequencies vary throughout the year owing to seasonal triggers. tezepelu-mab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets thymic stromal lymphopoietin. in the phase 3 navigator study (nct03347279), tezepelumab significantly reduced the annualized asthma exacerbation rate (aaer) vs placebo in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma. objective: to evaluate the effect of tezepelumab on asthma exacerbations across all seasons in navigator patients (post hoc). methods: navigator was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. patients (12-80 years old) were randomized 1:1 to tezepelumab 210 mg or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. aaer over 52 weeks was assessed by season. data from patients in the southern hemisphere were transformed to align with northern hemisphere seasons. results: tezepelumab reduced the aaer vs placebo by 63% (95% confidence interval [ci], 52-72) in winter, 46% (95% ci, 26-61) in spring, 62% (95% ci, 48-73) in summer, and 54% (95% ci, 41-64) in fall. in matched climates, during the spring allergy season (march 1 to june 15) and ragweed allergy season (september), tezepelumab reduced the aaer vs placebo in patients with seasonal allergy by 59% (95% ci, 29-77) and 70% (95% ci, 33-87), respectively. in patients with perennial allergy and in those with seasonal allergy, tezepelumab reduced the aaer vs placebo across all seasons. conclusion: tezepelumab reduced exacerbations across all seasons vs placebo in patients with severe, uncon-trolled asthma, including patients with seasonal and perennial allergies. these data further support the efficacy of tezepelumab in a broad population of patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct03347279 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03347279) (c) 2023 american college of allergy, asthma & immunology. published by elsevier inc. this is an open access arti-cle under the cc by license ()",AB_0437
"background antibody-drug conjugates (adcs) are a rapidly expanding class of compounds in oncology. our goal was to assess the expression of adc targets and potential downstream determining factors of activity across pan-cancer and normal tissues.materials and methods adcs in clinical trials (n = 121) were identified through clinicaltrials.gov, corresponding to 54 targets. genes potentially implicated in treatment response were identified in the literature. gene expression from the cancer genome atlas (9000+ cancers of 31 cancer types), the genotype-tissue expression database (n = 19,000 samples from 31 normal tissue types), and the tnmplot.com (n = 12,494 unmatched primary and metastatic samples) were used in this analysis. to compare relative expression across and within tumour types we used pooled normal tissues as reference.results for most adc targets, mrna levels correlated with protein expression. pan-cancer target expression distributions identified appealing cancer types for each adc development. co-expression of multiple targets was common and suggested opportunities for adc combinations. expression levels of genes potentially implicated in adc response downstream of the target might provide additional information (e.g. top1 was highly expressed in many tumour types, including breast and lung cancers). metastatic compared to primary tissues overexpressed some adcs targets. single sample targetgram plots were generated to visualise the expression of potentially competing adc targets and resistance/sensitivity markers highlighting high inter-patient heterogeneity. off-cancer target expression only partially explains adverse events, while expression of determinants of payload activity explained more of the observed toxicities.conclusion our findings draw attention to new therapeutic opportunities for adcs that can be tested in the clinic and our web platform (https://tnmplot.com) can assist in prioritising upcoming adc targets for clinical development.",AB_0437
"accurate and traceable measurements are required to understand ocean processes, to address pressing societal challenges, such as climate change and to sustainably manage marine resources. although scientific and engineering research has resulted in advanced methods to measure essential ocean variables (eovs) there is a need for cross comparison of the techniques and traceability to recognized standards. metrological laboratories are experienced in accredited methods and assessment of methodology. an eu infraia-02-2020: integrating activities for starting communities project minke (metrology for integrated marine management and knowledge-transfer network https://minke.eu) brings european marine science and metrology research infrastructures together to identify synergies and create an innovative approach to quality assurance of oceanographic data. quality depends both on the accuracy (that can be provided through the metrology component) and the completeness of the data sets. the collaboration between different marine research infrastructures (ris) places a fundamental role on assuring the completeness of the datasets, particularly at global scales. the minke project encourages enhancement through collaboration of national metrology laboratories and the oceanographic community. metrological assessment of the accuracy and uncertainties within multidisciplinary ocean observations will provide data that are key to delivering policy information. objectives across all the ris are to facilitate ocean observation and build wider synergies. minke will investigate these synergies, then introduce metrology to the core of various eov measurements. currently the marine ris cover laboratory and field operations, from the surface seafloor, coastal waters to deep sea, fixed ocean stations to ship and autonomous vehicle operations to ships of opportunity, and flux stations focusing on carbonate system variables. the nexus of these operations is the focal point for coordinated improvement of ocean observing methods. measurement intercomparisons, traceability and uncertainty assessments should be at the core of the scientific observations. specifically, minke will work with ris and metrology institutes to improve the quality of dissolved oxygen, carbonate system, chlorophyll-fluorescence, ocean sound and current meter measurements, through access to metrology laboratories, transnational access and intercomparison studies across existing marine consortia and ris. minke will also promote the development of absolute salinity observation, and improvements in marine litter measurements.",AB_0437
"(poly)phenol (pp)-rich blackcurrant (bc) extracts reduce postprandial glucose concentrations. combinations with other fruit (poly)phenols and fruit fibre may enhance the effect. this study investigated the acute effects of combinations of bc extracts, high (h-bc) and low (l-bc) (poly)phenol concentrations, sweet orange extracts (so) and fibre-rich orange pulp (f) in reducing postprandial glycaemia. in two randomised, double-blind, crossover design studies, healthy participants consumed seven types of 200 ml beverages: in the glu-fx trial, h-bc (1600 mg pp); l-bc (800 mg pp); so (800 mg pp); bc + so (1600 mg pp) or con (placebo); in the glu-mix trial, bc + f (800 mg pp), f (1.5 g fibre), or con2 (placebo), immediately followed by consumption of 75 g available carbohydrate (starch and sugars). blood was sampled at baseline and postprandially to measure changes in glucose, insulin, and gut hormones; appetite changes were assessed by visual analogue scales and, in glu-mix, ad libitum food intake and cognitive function were assessed. twenty-nine and thirty-seven adults completed glu-fx and glu-mix, respectively. l-bc reduced early postprandial glycaemia (0-30 min) with no differences in glucose incremental cmax or total glycaemic response. no significant effect was observed following other drinks relative to con. l-bc and h-bc drinks inhibited insulin secretion up to 30 min and gip up to 120 min. in glu-mix, bc + f improved some indicators of cognitive function but not all. measures of appetite were unaffected. the impact of (poly)phenol-rich bc extracts on total postprandial glycaemia in healthy participants was minimal and not enhanced when administered in combination with an orange (poly)phenol extract or orange pulp. clinical trials registered at https://www.clinicaltrials.gov: nct03184064 (glu-fx) and nct03572296 (glu-mix).

"backgroundtechnical progress in computational hardware allows researchers to use new approaches for sequence alignment problems. for a given sequence, we usually use smaller subsequences (anchors) to find possible candidate positions within a reference sequence. we may create pairs (position, subsequence) for the reference sequence and keep all such records without compression, even on a budget computer. as sequences for new and reference genomes differ, the goal is to find anchors, so we tolerate differences and keep the number of candidate positions with the same anchors to a minimum. spaced seeds (masks ignoring symbols at specific locations) are a way to approach the task. an ideal (full sensitivity) spaced seed should enable us to find all such positions subject to a given maximum number of mismatches permitted.resultsseveral algorithms to assist seed generation are presented. the first one finds all permitted spaced seeds iteratively. we observe specific patterns for the seeds of the highest weight. there are often periodic seeds with a simple relation between block size, length of the seed and read. the second algorithm produces blocks for periodic seeds for blocks of up to 50 symbols and up to nine mismatches. the third algorithm uses those lists to find spaced seeds for reads of an arbitrary length. finally, we apply seeds to a real dataset and compare results for other popular seeds.conclusionsperfseeb approach helps to significantly reduce the number of reads' possible alignment positions for a known number of mismatches. lists of long, high-weight spaced seeds are available in additional file 1. the seeds are best in weight compared to seeds from other papers and can usually be applied to shorter reads. codes for all algorithms and periodic blocks can be found at https://github.com/vtman/perfseeb.",AB_0437
"motivation: investigating cell differentiation under a genetic disorder offers the potential for improving current gene therapy strategies. clonal tracking provides a basis for mathematical modelling of population stem cell dynamics that sustain the blood cell formation, a process known as haematopoiesis. however, many clonal tracking protocols rely on a subset of cell types for the characterization of the stem cell output, and the data generated are subject to measurement errors and noise. results: we propose a stochastic framework to infer dynamic models of cell differentiation from clonal tracking data. a state-space formulation combines a stochastic quasi-reaction network, describing cell differentiation, with a gaussian measurement model accounting for data errors and noise. we developed an inference algorithm based on an extended kalman filter, a nonlinear optimization, and a rauch-tung-striebel smoother. simulations show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art and scales to complex structures of cell differentiations in terms of nodes size and network depth. the application of our method to five in vivo gene therapy studies reveals different dynamics of cell differentiation. our tool can provide statistical support to biologists and clinicians to better understand cell differentiation and haematopoietic reconstitution after a gene therapy treatment. the equations of the state-space model can be modified to infer other dynamics besides cell differentiation. availability and implementation: the stochastic framework is implemented in the r package karen which is available for download at https://cran.r-project.org/package=karen. the code that supports the findings of this study is openly available at https://github.com/delcore-luca/celldifferentiationnetworks.",AB_0437
"introduction: the normal development of all heart valves requires highly coordinated signaling pathways and downstream mediators. while genomic variants can be responsible for congenital valve disease, environmental factors can also play a role. later in life valve calcification is a leading cause of aortic valve stenosis, a progressive disease that may lead to heart failure. current research into the causes of both congenital valve diseases and valve calcification is using a variety of high-throughput methodologies, including transcriptomics, proteomics and genomics. high quality genetic data from biological knowledge bases are essential to facilitate analyses and interpretation of these high-throughput datasets. the gene ontology (go, http://geneontology.org/) is a major bioinformatics resource used to interpret these datasets, as it provides structured, computable knowledge describing the role of gene products across all organisms. the ucl functional gene annotation team focuses on go annotation of human gene products. having identified that the go annotations included in transcriptomic, proteomic and genomic data did not provide sufficient descriptive information about heart valve development, we initiated a focused project to address this issue.methods: this project prioritized 138 proteins for go annotation, which led to the curation of 100 peer-reviewed articles and the creation of 400 heart valve development-relevant go annotations.results: while the focus of this project was heart valve development, around 600 of the 1000 annotations created described the broader cellular role of these proteins, including those describing aortic valve morphogenesis, bmp signaling and endocardial cushion development. our functional enrichment analysis of the 28 proteins known to have a role in bicuspid aortic valve disease confirmed that this annotation project has led to an improved interpretation of a heart valve genetic dataset.discussion: to address the needs of the heart valve research community this project has provided go annotations to describe the specific roles of key proteins involved in heart valve development. the breadth of go annotations created by this project will benefit many of those seeking to interpret a wide range of cardiovascular genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic datasets.",AB_0437
"backgroundin covid-19 acute respiratory failure, the effects of cpap and fio(2) on respiratory effort and lung stress are unclear. we hypothesize that, in the compliant lungs of early sars-cov-2 pneumonia, the application of positive pressure through helmet-cpap may not decrease respiratory effort, and rather worsen lung stress and oxygenation when compared to higher fio(2) delivered via oxygen masks.methods in this single-center (s.luigi gonzaga university-hospital, turin, italy), randomized, crossover study, we included patients receiving helmet-cpap for early (< 48 h) covid-19 pneumonia without additional cardiac or respiratory disease. healthy subjects were included as controls. participants were equipped with an esophageal catheter, a non-invasive cardiac output monitor, and an arterial catheter. the protocol consisted of a random sequence of non-rebreather mask (nrb), helmet-cpap (with variable positive pressure and fio(2)) and venturi mask (fio(2) 0.5), each delivered for 20 min. study outcomes were changes in respiratory effort (esophageal swing), total lung stress (dynamic + static transpulmonary pressure), gas-exchange and hemodynamics.resultswe enrolled 28 covid-19 patients and 7 healthy controls. in all patients, respiratory effort increased from nrb to helmet-cpap (5.0 +/- 3.7 vs 8.3 +/- 3.9 cmh(2)o, p < 0.01). however, helmet's pressure decreased by a comparable amount during inspiration (- 3.1 +/- 1.0 cmh(2)o, p = 0.16), therefore dynamic stress remained stable (p = 0.97). changes in static and total lung stress from nrb to helmet-cpap were overall not significant (p = 0.07 and p = 0.09, respectively), but showed high interpatient variability, ranging from - 4.5 to + 6.1 cmh(2)o, and from - 5.8 to + 5.7 cmh(2)o, respectively. all findings were confirmed in healthy subjects, except for an increase in dynamic stress (p < 0.01). pao2 decreased from nrb to helmet-cpap with fio(2) 0.5 (107 +/- 55 vs 86 +/- 30 mmhg, p < 0.01), irrespective of positive pressure levels (p = 0.64). conversely, with helmet's fio(2) 0.9, pao2 increased (p < 0.01), but oxygen delivery remained stable (p = 0.48) as cardiac output decreased (p = 0.02). when pao2 fell below 60 mmhg with vm, respiratory effort increased proportionally (p < 0.01, r = 0.81).conclusionsin early covid-19 pneumonia, helmet-cpap increases respiratory effort without altering dynamic stress, while the effects upon static and total stress are variable, requiring individual assessment. oxygen masks with higher fio2 provide better oxygenation with lower respiratory effort.trial registration retrospectively registered (13-may-2021): clinicaltrials.gov (nct04885517), https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04885517.conclusionsin early covid-19 pneumonia, helmet-cpap increases respiratory effort without altering dynamic stress, while the effects upon static and total stress are variable, requiring individual assessment. oxygen masks with higher fio(2) provide better oxygenation with lower respiratory effort.trial registration retrospectively registered (13-may-2021): clinicaltrials.gov (nct04885517), https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04885517.",AB_0437
"structure-based virtual screening (sbvs) via docking has been used to discover active molecules for a range of therapeutic targets. chemical and protein data sets that contain integrated bioactivity information have increased both in number and in size. artificial intelligence and, more concretely, its machine-learning (ml) branch, including deep learning, have effectively exploited these data sets to build scoring functions (sfs) for sbvs against targets with an atomic-resolution 3d model (e.g., generated by x-ray crystallography or predicted by alphafold2). often outperforming their generic and non-ml counterparts, target-specific ml-based sfs represent the state of the art for sbvs. here, we present a comprehensive and user-friendly protocol to build and rigorously evaluate these new sfs for sbvs. this protocol is organized into four sections: (i) using a public benchmark of a given target to evaluate an existing generic sf; (ii) preparing experimental data for a target from public repositories; (iii) partitioning data into a training set and a test set for subsequent target-specific ml modeling; and (iv) generating and evaluating target-specific ml sfs by using the prepared training-test partitions. all necessary code and input/output data related to three example targets (acetylcholinesterase, hmg-coa reductase, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha) are available at https://github. com/vktrannguyen/mlsf-protocol, can be run by using a single computer within 1 week and make use of easily accessible software/programs (e.g., smina, cnn-score, rf-score-vs and deepcoy) and web resources. our aim is to provide practical guidance on how to augment training data to enhance sbvs performance, how to identify the most suitable supervised learning algorithm for a data set, and how to build an sf with the highest likelihood of discovering target-active molecules within a given compound library.",AB_0437
