"type 9 secretion system (t9ss) is one of the least characterized secretion systems exclusively found in the bacteroidetes phylum, which comprises various environmental and economically relevant bacteria. while t9ss plays a central role in bacterial movement termed gliding motility, survival, and pathogenicity, there is an unmet need for a comprehensive tool that predicts t9ss, gliding motility, and proteins secreted via t9ss. in this study, we develop such a computational tool, type 9 secretion system and gliding motility prediction (t9gpred). to build this tool, we manually curated published experimental evidence and identified mandatory components for t9ss and gliding motility prediction. we also compiled experimentally characterized proteins secreted via t9ss and determined the presence of three unique types of c-terminal domain signals, and these insights were leveraged to predict proteins secreted via t9ss. notably, using recently published experimental evidence, we show that t9gpred has high predictive power. thus, we used t9gpred to predict the presence of t9ss, gliding motility, and associated secreted proteins across 693 completely sequenced bacteroidetes strains. t9gpred predicted 402 strains to have t9ss, of which 327 strains are also predicted to exhibit gliding motility. further, t9gpred also predicted putative secreted proteins for the 402 strains. in a nutshell, t9gpred is a novel computational tool for systems-level prediction of t9ss and streamlining future experimentation. the source code of the computational tool is available in our github repository: https://github.com/asamallab/t9gpred. the tool and its predicted results are compiled in a web server available at: https://cb.imsc.res.in/t9gpred/.",AB_0484
"the recovery of morphologically accurate anatomical images from deformed ones is challenging in ultrasound (us) image acquisition, but crucial to accurate and consistent diagnosis, particularly in the emerging field of computer-assisted diagnosis. this article presents a novel physics-aware deformation correction approach based on a coarse-to-fine, multi-scale deep neural network (defcor-net). to achieve pixel-wise performance, defcor-net incorporates biomedical knowledge by estimating pixel-wise stiffness online using a u-shaped feature extractor. the deformation field is then computed using polynomial regression by integrating the measured force applied by the us probe. based on real-time estimation of pixel-by-pixel tissue properties, the learning-based approach enables the potential for anatomy-aware deformation correction. to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed defcor-net, images recorded at multiple locations on forearms and upper arms of six volunteers are used to train and validate defcor-net. the results demonstrate that defcor-net can significantly improve the accuracy of deformation correction to recover the original geometry (dice coefficient: from 14.3 +/- 20.9 to 82.6 +/- 12.1 when the force is 6 n). code: https://github.com/karolinezhy/defcornet.",AB_0484
"background and objective: baroreflex sensitivity constitutes an indicator of the function of the baroreceptor control mechanism of blood pressure levels. it can be computed after estimating heart rate and blood pressure variability. we propose a novel tool for the evaluation of baroreflex sensitivity using wavelet analysis methods. this tool, known as barowavelet, incorporates an algorithm proposal based on the analysis methodology of the rhrv software package, as well as other conventional techniques. our objectives are to develop and evaluate the tool, by testing its ability to detect changes in baroreflex sensitivity in humans.methods: the code for this tool was designed in the r programming environment and was organized into two analysis routines and a graphical interface. simulated recordings of blood pressure and inter-beat intervals were employed for an initial evaluation of the tool in a controlled environment. finally, similar recordings obtained during supine and orthostatic postural evaluations, from patients that belonged to the open-access eurobavar data set, were analyzed.results: barowavelet identified the scripted changes of the baroreflex sensitivity in the simulated data. the al-gorithm proposal was also able to better retain additional information regarding the dynamics of the baroreflex. in the eurobavar subjects, baroreflex sensitivity components were significantly smaller during orthostatism when compared with the supine position.conclusions: barowavelet managed to characterize baroreflex dynamics from the recordings, which were consistent with the findings reported in the literature. this demonstrates its effectiveness to perform these an-alyses. we suggest that this tool may be of use in research and for the evaluation of baroreflex sensitivity with clinical and therapeutic purposes. the new tool is available at the official github repository of the autonomic nervous system unit of the university of m ' alaga (https://github.com/cimes-usna-uma/barowavelet).",AB_0484
"lead optimization supported by artificial intelligence (ai)-based generative models has become increasingly important in drug design. success factors are reagent availability, novelty, and the optimization of multiple properties. directed fragment-replacement is particularly attractive, as it mimics medicinal chemistry tactics. here, we present variations of fragment-based reinforcement learning using an actor-critic model. novel features include freezing fragments and using reagents as the fragment source. splitting molecules according to reaction schemes improves synthesizability, while tuning network output probabilities allows us to balance novelty versus diversity. combining fragment-based optimization with virtual library encodings allows the exploration of large chemical spaces with synthesizable ideas. collectively, these enhancements influence design toward high-quality molecules with favorable profiles. a validation study using 15 pharmaceutically relevant targets reveals that novel structures are obtained for most cases, which are identical or related to independent validation sets for each target. hence, these modifications significantly increase the value of fragment-based reinforcement learning for drug design. the code is available on github: https://github.com/sanofi-public/idd-papers-fragrl",AB_0484
"performance metrics for medical image segmentation models are used to measure the agreement between the reference annotation and the predicted segmentation. usually, overlap metrics, such as the dice, are used as a metric to evaluate the performance of these models in order for results to be comparable.however, there is a mismatch between the distributions of cases and the difficulty level of segmentation tasks in public data sets compared to clinical practice. common metrics used to assess performance fail to capture the impact of this mismatch, particularly when dealing with datasets in clinical settings that involve challenging segmentation tasks, pathologies with low signal, and reference annotations that are uncertain, small, or empty. limitations of common metrics may result in ineffective machine learning research in designing and optimizing models. to effectively evaluate the clinical value of such models, it is essential to consider factors such as the uncertainty associated with reference annotations, the ability to accurately measure performance regardless of the size of the reference annotation volume, and the classification of cases where reference annotations are empty.we study how uncertain, small, and empty reference annotations influence the value of metrics on a stroke in-house data set regardless of the model. we examine metrics behavior on the predictions of a standard deep learning framework in order to identify suitable metrics in such a setting. we compare our results to the brats 2019 and spinal cord public data sets. we show how uncertain, small, or empty reference annotations require a rethinking of the evaluation. the evaluation code was released to encourage further analysis of this topic https://github.com/sophieostmeier/uncertainsmallempty.git.",AB_0484
"background: left ventricular (lv) global longitudinal strain (gls) provides incremental prognostic information over lv ejection fraction in patients with heart failure (hf) and secondary mitral regurgitation. we examined the prognostic impact of lv gls improvement in this population. methods and results: the coapt (cardiovascular outcomes assessment of the mitraclip percutaneous therapy for heart failure patients with functional mitral regurgitation) trial randomized symptomatic patients with hf with severe (3+/4+) mitral regurgitation to transcatheter edge-to-edge repair with the mitraclip device plus maximally tolerated guideline-directed medical therapy (gdmt) versus gdmt alone. lv gls was measured at baseline and 6-month follow-up. the relationship between the improvement in lv gls from baseline to 6 months and the composite of all-cause death or hf hospitalization between 6-and 24-month follow-up were assessed. among 383 patients, 174 (45.4%) had improved lv gls at 6-month follow-up (83/195 [42.6%] with transcatheter edge-to-edge repair+gdmt and 91/188 [48.4%] with gdmt alone; p=0.25). improvement in lv gls was strongly associated with reduced death or hf hospitalization between 6 and 24 months (p<0.009), with similar risk reduction in both treatment arms (p interaction=0.40). by multivariable analysis, lv gls improvement at 6 months was independently associated with a lower risk of death or hf hospitalization (hazard ratio [hr], 0.55 [95% ci, 0.36-0.83]; p= 0.009), death (hr, 0.48 [95% ci, 0.29-0.81]; p=0.006), and hf hospitalization (hr, 0.50 [95% ci, 0.31-0.81]; p=0.005) between 6 and 24 months. conclusions: among patients with hf and severe mitral regurgitation in the coapt trial, improvement in lv gls at 6-month follow-up was associated with improved outcomes after both transcatheter edge-to-edge repair and gdmt alone between 6 and 24 months. registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct01626079.",AB_0484
"backgroundreward sensitivity constitutes a potential key mechanism regarding the etiology and maintenance of mental disorders, especially depression. however, due to a lack of longitudinal studies, the temporal dynamics are not clear yet. although some evidence indicates that reward processing could be a transdiagnostic mechanism of disorders, these observations could be also a product of comorbidity with depression. this study aimed at investigating the temporal dynamics of reward sensitivity and the course of psychopathological symptoms in a longitudinal investigation, while taking a possible mediating role of depression into account.methodswe conducted a three-wave longitudinal online survey with a 4-week interval. a total of n = 453 participants filled out all three questionnaires. reward sensitivity was assessed with the positive valence system scale-21 (pvss-21), depression with the patient health questionnaire (phq-9), eating disorder symptoms with the eating disorder examination-questionnaire-8 (ede-q-8), social anxiety with the mini-social phobia inventory (mini-spin) and alcohol consumption with the alcohol use disorders identification test-consumption (audit-c). cross-lagged panels and mediation analyses were calculated using path analyses.resultsdepressive and eating disorder symptoms predicted reward insensitivity at later points in time. effects were larger from t2 to t3. a bidirectional relationship concerning social anxiety was found. higher alcohol consumption predicted higher reward sensitivity. depression at t2 fully mediated the association between psychopathological symptoms at t1 and reward sensitivity at t3 for social anxiety and eating disorder symptoms.conclusionsour findings imply that reduced reward sensitivity seems to be a consequence rather than an antecedent of psychopathological symptoms. comorbid depression plays a crucial role in other mental disorders regarding observed hyposensitivity towards rewards. therefore, our results do not support a transdiagnostic notion of reward sensitivity, but they indicate a potential role of reward sensitivity for symptom persistence.trial registrationthe study was preregistered at the open science framework (osf) (https://archive.org/details/osf-registrations-6n3s8-v1; registration doi https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/6n3s8).",AB_0484
"obtaining text datasets with semantic annotations is an effortful process, yet crucial for supervised training in natural language processing (nlp). in general, developing and applying new nlp pipelines in domain-specific contexts for tasks often requires custom-designed datasets to address nlp tasks in a supervised machine learning fashion. when operating in non-english languages for medical data processing, this exposes several minor and major, interconnected problems such as the lack of task-matching datasets as well as task-specific pre-trained models.in our work, we suggest to leverage pre-trained large language models for training data acquisition in order to retrieve sufficiently large datasets for training smaller and more efficient models for use-case-specific tasks. to demonstrate the effectiveness of your approach, we create a custom dataset that we use to train a medical ner model for german texts, gptnermed, yet our method remains language-independent in principle. our obtained dataset as well as our pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/frankkramer-lab/gptnermed.",AB_0484
"sequence alignment pipelines for human genomes are an emerging workload that will dominate in the precision medicine field. bwa-mem2 is a tool widely used in the scientific community to perform read mapping studies. in this paper, we port bwa-mem2 to the aarch64 architecture using the armv8-a specification, and we compare the resulting version against an intel skylake system both in performance and in energy-to-solution. the porting effort entails numerous code modifications, since bwa-mem2 implements certain kernels using x86_64 specific intrinsics, e.g., avx-512. to adapt this code we use the recently introduced arm's scalable vector extensions (sve). more specifically, we use fujitsu's a64fx processor, the first to implement sve. the a64fx powers the fugaku supercomputer that led the top500 ranking from june 2020 to november 2021. after porting bwa-mem2 we define and implement a number of optimizations to improve performance in the a64fx target architecture. we show that while the a64fx performance is lower than that of the skylake system, a64fx delivers 11.6% better energy-to-solution on average. all the code used for this article is available at https://gitlab.bsc.es/rlangari/bwa-a64fx.",AB_0484
"knowledge distillation (kd) is a strategy for the definition of a set of transferability gangways to improve the efficiency of convolutional neural networks. feature-based knowledge distillation is a subfield of kd that relies on intermediate network representations, either unaltered or depth-reduced via maximum activation maps, as the source knowledge. in this paper, we propose and analyze the use of a 2d frequency transform of the activation maps before transferring them. we pose that-by using global image cues rather than pixel estimates, this strategy enhances knowledge transferability in tasks such as scene recognition, defined by strong spatial and contextual relationships between multiple and varied concepts. to validate the proposed method, an extensive evaluation of the state of the art in scene recognition is presented. experimental results provide strong evidence that the proposed strategy enables the student network to better focus on the relevant image areas learnt by the teacher network, hence leading to better descriptive features and higher transferred performance than every other state-of-the-art alternative. we publicly release the training and evaluation framework used in this paper at https://www-vpu.eps.uam.es/publications/dctbasedkdforscenerecognition.",AB_0484
