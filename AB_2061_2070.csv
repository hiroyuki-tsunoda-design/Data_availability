"dna-binding proteins (dbps) play vital roles in the regulation of biological systems. although there are already many deep learning methods for predicting the sequence specificities of dbps, they face two challenges as follows. classic deep learning methods for dbps prediction usually fail to capture the dependencies between genomic sequences since their commonly used one-hot codes are mutually orthogonal. besides, these methods usually perform poorly when samples are inadequate. to address these two challenges, we developed a novel language model for mining dbps using human genomic data and chip-seq datasets with decaying learning rates, named dna fine-tuned language model (dflm). it can capture the dependencies between genome sequences based on the context of human genomic data and then fine-tune the features of dbps tasks using different chip-seq datasets. first, we compared dflm with the existing widely used methods on 69 datasets and we achieved excellent performance. moreover, we conducted comparative experiments on complex dbps and small datasets. the results show that dflm still achieved a significant improvement. finally, through visualization analysis of one-hot encoding and dflm, we found that one-hot encoding completely cut off the dependencies of dna sequences themselves, while dflm using language models can well represent the dependency of dna sequences. source code are available at: https://github.com/deep-bioinfo/dflm.",AB_0207
"single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) measures expression profiles at the single-cell level, which sheds light on revealing the heterogeneity and functional diversity among cell populations. the vast majority of current algorithms identify cell types by directly clustering transcriptional profiles, which ignore indirect relations among cells, resulting in an undesirable performance on cell type discovery and trajectory inference. therefore, there is a critical need for inferring cell types and trajectories by exploiting the interactions among cells. in this study, we propose a network-based structural learning nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm (aka slnmf) for the identification of cell types in scrna-seq, which is transformed into a constrained optimization problem. slnmf first constructs the similarity network for cells and then extracts latent features of the cells by exploiting the topological structure of the cell-cell network. to improve the clustering performance, the structural constraint is imposed on the model to learn the latent features of cells by preserving the structural information of the networks, thereby significantly improving the performance of algorithms. finally, we track the trajectory of cells by exploring the relationships among cell types. fourteen scrna-seq datasets are adopted to validate the performance of algorithms with the number of single cells varying from 49 to 26,484. the experimental results demonstrate that slnmf significantly outperforms fifteen state-of-the-art methods with 15.32% improvement in terms of accuracy, and it accurately identifies the trajectories of cells. the proposed model and methods provide an effective strategy to analyze scrna-seq data.

"metagenome sequencing provides an unprecedented opportunity for the discovery of unknown microbes and viruses. a large number of phages and prokaryotes are mixed together in metagenomes. to study the influence of phages on human bodies and environments, it is of great significance to isolate phages from metagenomes. however, it is difficult to identify novel phages because of the diversity of their sequences and the frequent presence of short contigs in metagenomes. here, virsearcher is developed to identify phages from metagenomes by combining the convolutional neural network (cnn) and the gene information of input sequences. firstly, an input sequence is encoded in accordance with the different functions of its coding and the non-coding regions and then is converted into word embedding code through a word embedding layer before a convolutional layer. meanwhile, the hit ratio of the virus genes is combined with the output of the cnn to further improve the performance of the network. the genes used by virsearcher consist of complete and incomplete genes. experiments on several metagenomes have showed that, compared with others, virsearcher can significantly improve the performance for the identification of short sequences, while maintaining the performance for long ones. the source code of virsearcher is freely available from http://github.com/drjackson18/virsearcher",AB_0207
"protein-protein interactions are the basis of many cellular biological processes, such as cellular organization, signal transduction, and immune response. identifying protein-protein interaction sites is essential for understanding the mechanisms of various biological processes, disease development, and drug design. however, it remains a challenging task to make accurate predictions, as the small amount of training data and severe imbalanced classification reduce the performance of computational methods. we design a deep learning method named ctp(2)isp to improve the prediction of protein-protein interaction sites. ctp(2)isp employs convolution and transformer to extract information and enhance information perception so that semantic features can be mined to identify protein-protein interaction sites. a weighting loss function with different sample weights is designed to suppress the preference of the model toward multi-category prediction. to efficiently reuse the information in the training set, a preprocessing of data augmentation with an improved sample-oriented sampling strategy is applied. the trained ctp(2)isp was evaluated against current stateof-the-art methods on six public datasets. the results show that ctp(2)isp outperforms all other competing methods on the balance metrics: f1, mcc, and auprc. in particular, our prediction on open tests related to viruses may also be consistent with biological insights. the source code and data can be obtained from https://github.com/lennylv/ctp2isp.",AB_0207
"the recognition of dna- (dbps) and rna-binding proteins (rbps) is not only conducive to understanding cell function, but also a challenging task. previous studies have shown that these proteins are usually considered separately due to different binding domains. in addition, due to the high similarity between dbps and rbps, it is possible for dbps predictor to predict rbps as dbps, and vice versa, which leads to high cross-prediction rate. in this study, we creatively propose a novel deep multi-label joint learning framework to leverage the relationship between multiple labels and binding proteins. first, a multi-label variant network is designed to explore multi-scale context hidden information. then, multi-label long short-term memory (multilstm) is used to mine the potential relationship between labels. finally, the calibrated hidden features from variant network are considered for different levels of joint learning so that multilstm can better explore the correlation between them. extensive experiments are also carried out to compare the proposed method with other existing methods. furthermore, we also provide further insights into the importance of the relevant bioanalysis of proteins obtained from our model and summarize these binding proteins that are significantly related to a disease. our method is freely available at http://39.108.90.186/dmlj.",AB_0207
"single cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) provides a powerful approach for profiling transcriptomes at single cell resolution. an essential application of scrna-seq is the discovery of cell types with the aid of clustering analysis. currently, existing single cell clustering methods are exclusively based on gene-level expression data, without considering alternative splicing information. it has been shown that alternative splicing has an important influence on biological processes such as cell differentiation and cell cycle. we therefore hypothesize that adding information about alternative splicing may help enhance single cell clustering. this motivates us to develop a way to integrate isoform-level expression and gene-level expression. we report an approach to enhance single cell clustering by integrating isoform-level expression through orthogonal projection. first, we construct an orthogonal projection matrix based on gene expression data. second, isoforms are projected to the gene space to remove the redundant information between them. third, isoform selection is performed based on the residual of the projected expression and the selected isoforms are combined with gene expression data for subsequent clustering. we applied our method to sixteen scrna-seq datasets. we find that alternative splicing contains differential information among cell types and can be integrated to enhance single cell clustering. compared with using only gene-level expression data, the integration of isoform-level expression leads to better clustering performances for most of the datasets. the integration of isoform-level expression also has potential in the detection of novel cell subgroups. our study shows that integrating isoform and gene-level expression is a promising way to improve single cell clustering. the isocell r package is freely available at both github (https://github.com/genemine/isocell) and zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/4395707).",AB_0207
"with the increasing demand for low-cost high-throughput sequencing of large genomes, next-generation sequencing (ngs) technology has developed rapidly. ngs can not only be used in basic scientific research but also in clinical diagnostics and healthcare. numerous software systems and tools have been developed to analyze ngs data, and various data formats have been produced to accommodate different sequencing equipment providers or analytical software. however, the data interoperability between these tools brings great challenges to researchers. a generic format that could be shared by most of the software and tools in the ngs field would make data interoperability and sharing easier. in this paper, we defined a general xml-based ngs markup language (ngsml) format for the representation and exchange of ngs data. we also developed a user-friendly gui tool, ngsmleditor, for presenting, creating, editing, and converting ngsml files. by using ngsml, various types of ngs data can be saved in one unified format. compared with the unstructured plain text file, a structured data format based on xml technology solves the incompatibility of various ngs data formats. the ngsml specifications are freely available from http://www.sysbio.org.cn/ngsml. ngsmleditor is open source under gnu gpl and can be downloaded from the website.",AB_0207
"the automatic extraction of the chemical-disease relation (cdr) from the text becomes critical because it takes a lot of time and effort to extract valuable cdr manually. studies have shown that prior knowledge from the biomedical knowledge base is important for relation extraction. the method of combining deep learning models with prior knowledge is worthy of our study. in this paper, we propose a new model called knowledge guided attention and graph convolutional networks (kgagn) for cdr extraction. first, to make full advantage of domain knowledge, we train entity embedding as a feature representation of input sequence, and relation embedding to capture weighted contextual information further through the attention mechanism. then, to make full advantage of syntactic dependency information in cross-sentence cdr extraction, we construct document-level syntactic dependency graphs and encode them using a graph convolution network (gcn). finally, the chemical-induced disease (cid) relation is extracted by using weighted context features and long-range dependency features both of which contain additional knowledge informationwe evaluated our model on the cdr dataset published by the biocreative-v community and achieves an f1-score of 73.3%, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods. the code implemented by pytorch 1.7.0 deep learning library can be downloaded from github: https://github.com/sunyi123/cdr.",AB_0207
"nuclei segmentation is an essential step indna ploidy analysis by image-based cytometry (dna-icm) which iswidely used in cytopathology and allows an objectivemeasurement ofdna content (ploidy). the routine fully supervised learning-based method requires often tedious and expensive pixel-wise labels. in this paper, we propose a novelweakly supervised nuclei segmentation framework which exploits only sparsely annotated bounding boxes, without any segmentation labels. the key is to integrate the traditional image segmentation and self-training into fully supervised instance segmentation. we first leverage the traditional segmentation to generate coarsemasks for each box-annotated nucleus to supervise the training of a teacher model, which is then responsible for both the refinement of these coarse masks and pseudo labels generation of unlabeled nuclei. these pseudo labels and refinedmasks along with the original manually annotated bounding boxes jointly supervise the training of studentmodel. both teacher and student share the same architecture and especially the student is initialized by the teacher. we have extensively evaluated our methodwith both our dna-icmdataset and public cytopathological dataset. without bells andwhistles, our method outperforms all existingweakly supervised entries on both datasets. code and our dna-icmdataset are publicly available at https://github.com/cviu-csu/weakly-supervised-nuclei-segmentation.",AB_0207
"identification of dna-binding proteins (dbps) and rna-binding proteins (rbps) from the primary sequences is essential for further exploring protein-nucleic acid interactions. previous studies have shown that machine-learning-based methods can efficiently identify dbps or rbps. however, the information used in these methods is slightly unitary, and most of them only can predict dbps or rbps. in this study, we proposed a computational predictor idrbp-el to identify dna- and rna- binding proteins, and introduced hierarchical ensemble learning to integrate three level information. the method can integrate the information of different features, machine learning algorithms and data into one multi-label model. the ablation experiment showed that the fusion of different information can improve the prediction performance and overcome the cross-prediction problem. experimental results on the independent datasets showed that idrbp-el outperformed all the other competing methods. moreover, we established a user-friendly webserver idrbp-el (http://bliulab.net/idrbp-el), which can predict both dbps and rbps only based on protein sequences.",AB_0207
