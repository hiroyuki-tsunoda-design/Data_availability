"motivation: a single gene may yield several isoforms with different functions through alternative splicing. continuous efforts are devoted to developing machine-learning methods to predict isoform functions. however, existing methods do not consider the relevance of each feature to specific functions and ignore the noise caused by the irrelevant features. in this case, we hypothesize that constructing a feature selection framework to extract the function-relevant features might help improve the model accuracy in isoform function prediction. results: in this article, we present a feature selection-based approach named isofrog to predict isoform functions. first, isofrog adopts a reversible jump markov chain monte carlo (rjmcmc)-based feature selection framework to assess the feature importance to gene functions. second, a sequential feature selection procedure is applied to select a subset of function-relevant features. this strategy screens the relevant features for the specific function while eliminating irrelevant ones, improving the effectiveness of the input features. then, the selected features are input into our proposed method modified domain-invariant partial least squares, which prioritizes the most likely positive isoform for each positive mig and utilizes dipls for isoform function prediction. tested on three datasets, our method achieves superior performance over six state-of-the-art methods, and the rjmcmc-based feature selection framework outperforms three classic feature selection methods. we expect this proposed methodology will promote the identification of isoform functions and further inspire the development of new methods. availability and implementation: isofrog is freely available at https://github.com/genemine/isofrog.",AB_0229
"smoke and fire detection technology is a key technology for automatically realizing forest monitoring and forest fire warning. one of the most popular algorithms for object detection tasks is yolov5. however, it suffers from some challenges, such as high computational load and limited detection performance. this paper proposes a high-performance lightweight network model for detecting forest smoke and fire based on yolov5 to overcome these problems. c3ghost and ghost modules are introduced into the backbone and neck network to achieve the purpose of reducing network parameters and improving the feature's expressing performance. coordinate attention (ca) module is introduced into the backbone network to highlight the object's important information about smoke and fire and to suppress irrelevant background information. in neck network part, in order to distinguish the importance of different features in feature fusing process, the weight parameter of feature fusion is added which is based on pan (path aggregation network) structure, which is named pan-weight. multiple sets of controlled experiments were conducted to confirm the proposed method's performance. compared with yolov5s, the proposed method reduced the model size and flops by 44.75% and 47.46% respectively, while increased precision and map(mean average precision)@0.5 by 2.53% and 1.16% respectively. the experimental results demonstrated the usefulness and superiority of the proposed method. the core code and dataset required for the experiment are saved in this article at https://github.com/vinchole/zzzccc.git.",AB_0229
"motivation a critical issue in drug benefit-risk assessment is to determine the frequency of side effects, which is performed by randomized controlled trails. computationally predicted frequencies of drug side effects can be used to effectively guide the randomized controlled trails. however, it is more challenging to predict drug side effect frequencies, and thus only a few studies cope with this problem.results in this work, we propose a neighborhood-regularization method (nrfse) that leverages multiview data on drugs and side effects to predict the frequency of side effects. first, we adopt a class-weighted non-negative matrix factorization to decompose the drug-side effect frequency matrix, in which gaussian likelihood is used to model unknown drug-side effect pairs. second, we design a multiview neighborhood regularization to integrate three drug attributes and two side effect attributes, respectively, which makes most similar drugs and most similar side effects have similar latent signatures. the regularization can adaptively determine the weights of different attributes. we conduct extensive experiments on one benchmark dataset, and nrfse improves the prediction performance compared with five state-of-the-art approaches. independent test set of post-marketing side effects further validate the effectiveness of nrfse.availability and implementation source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/linwang1982/nrfse or https://codeocean.com/capsule/4741497/tree/v1.",AB_0229
"medical image segmentation is a crucial and intricate process in medical image processing and analysis. with the advancements in artificial intelligence, deep learning techniques have been widely used in recent years for medical image segmentation. one such technique is the u-net framework based on the u-shaped convolutional neural networks (cnn) and its variants. however, these methods have limitations in simultaneously capturing both the global and the remote semantic information due to the restricted receptive domain caused by the convolution operation's intrinsic features. transformers are attention-based models with excellent global modeling capabilities, but their ability to acquire local information is limited. to address this, we propose a network that combines the strengths of bothcnnand transformer, called cotrfuse. the proposed cotrfuse network uses efficientnet and swin transformer as dual encoders. the swin transformer andcnn fusion module are combined to fuse the features of both branches before the skip connection structure. weevaluated the proposed network on two datasets: the isic-2017 challenge dataset and the covid-qu-ex dataset. our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed cotrfuse outperforms several state-of-the-art segmentation methods, indicating its superiority in medical image segmentation. the codes are available at https://github.com/binycn/cotrfuse.",AB_0229
"objective. metal artifact reduction (mar) remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of removing artifacts while preserving anatomical details of the tissue. although current dual-domain networks have shown promising performance in mar, they heavily rely on the image domain, which can be too smooth and lose important information in the metal-affected area. to address this problem, we propose an improved dual domain network framework. approach. we enhance sinogram completion performance by utilizing an aggregated contextual transformations network in the sinogram domain. furthermore, we utilize a prior-projection-based linearized correction method to obtain images with beam-hardening artifacts removed, which are incorporated into the input of the image post-processing network to assist in training the image domain network. finally, we train the sinogram domain network and the image domain network separately to their respective convergences. main results. in experiments conducted on a simulated dataset, our method achieves the best average rmse of 25.1, ssim of 0.973, and psnr of 42.1, respectively. significance. the proposed method is capable of preserving tissue structures near metallic objects while eliminating metal artifacts from the reconstructed images. related codes will be released at https://github.com/corinna-china/aotdudonet",AB_0229
"the next-generation sequencing brought opportunities for the diagnosis of genetic disorders due to its high-throughput capabilities. however, the majority of existing methods were limited to only sequencing candidate variants, and the process of linking these variants to a diagnosis of genetic disorders still required medical professionals to consult databases. therefore, we introduce diseasegps, an integrated platform for the diagnosis of genetic disorders that combines both phenotype and genotype data for analysis. it offers not only a user-friendly gui web application for those without a programming background but also scripts that can be executed in batch mode for bioinformatics professionals. the genetic and phenotypic data are integrated using the acmg-bayes method and a novel phenotypic similarity method, to prioritize the results of genetic disorders. diseasegps was evaluated on 6085 cases from deciphering developmental disorders project and 187 cases from shanghai children's hospital. the results demonstrated that diseasegps performed better than other commonly used methods. availability and implementation: diseasegps is available to freely accessed at https://diseasegps.sjtu.edu.cn with source code at https://github.com/biohuangdy/diseasegps.",AB_0229
"pruning is an efficient method for deep neural network model compression and acceleration. however, existing pruning strategies, both at the filter level and at the channel level, often introduce a large amount of computation and adopt complex methods for finding sub-networks. it is found that there is a linear relationship between the sum of matrix elements of the channels in convolutional neural networks (cnns) and the expectation scaling ratio of the image pixel distribution, which is reflects the relationship between the expectation change of the pixel distribution between the feature mapping and the input data. this implies that channels with similar expectation scaling factors (de) cause similar expectation changes to the input data, thus producing redundant feature mappings. thus, this article proposes a new structured pruning method called exp. in the proposed method, the channels with similar de are randomly removed in each convolutional layer, and thus the whole network achieves random sparsity to obtain non-redundant and non-unique sub-networks. experiments on pruning various networks show that exp can achieve a significant reduction of flops. for example, on the cifar-10 dataset, exp reduces the flops of the resnet-56 model by 71.9% with a 0.23% loss in top-1 accuracy. on ilsvrc-2012, it reduces the flops of the resnet-50 model by 60.0% with a 1.13% loss of top-1 accuracy. our code is available at: https://github. com/exp-pruning/exp_pruning and doi: 10.5281/zenodo.8141065.",AB_0229
"weakly-supervised learning (wsl) has been proposed to alleviate the conflict between data annotation cost and model performance through employing sparsely-grained (i.e., point-, box-, scribble-wise) supervision and has shown promising performance, particularly in the image segmentation field. however, it is still a very challenging task due to the limited supervision, especially when only a small number of labeled samples are available. additionally, almost all existing wsl segmentation methods are designed for star-convex structures which are very different from curvilinear structures such as vessels and nerves. in this paper, we propose a novel sparsely annotated segmentation framework for curvilinear structures, named yolocurvseg. a very essential component of yolocurvseg is image synthesis. specifically, a background generator delivers image backgrounds that closely match the real distributions through inpainting dilated skeletons. the extracted backgrounds are then combined with randomly emulated curves generated by a space colonization algorithm based foreground generator and through a multilayer patch-wise contrastive learning synthesizer. in this way, a synthetic dataset with both images and curve segmentation labels is obtained, at the cost of only one or a few noisy skeleton annotations. finally, a segmenter is trained with the generated dataset and possibly an unlabeled dataset. the proposed yolocurvseg is evaluated on four publicly available datasets (octa500, corn, drive and chasedb1) and the results show that yolocurvseg outperforms state-of-the-art wsl segmentation methods by large margins. with only one noisy skeleton annotation (respectively 0.14%, 0.03%, 1.40%, and 0.65% of the full annotation), yolocurvseg achieves more than 97% of the fully-supervised performance on each dataset. code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/llmir/yolocurvseg.",AB_0229
"due to the tolerance of mismatches between grna and targeting sequence, base editors frequently induce unwanted cas9-dependent off-target mutations. here, to develop models to predict such off-targets, we design grna-offtarget pairs for adenine base editors (abes) and cytosine base editors (cbes) and stably integrate them into the human cells. after five days of editing, we obtain valid efficiency datasets of 54,663 and 55,727 off-targets for abes and cbes, respectively. we use the datasets to train deep learning models, resulting in abedeepoff and cbedeepoff, which can predict off-target sites. we use these tools to predict off-targets for a panel of endogenous loci and achieve spearman correlation values varying from 0.710 to 0.859. finally, we develop an integrated tool that is freely accessible via an online web server http://www. deephf.com/#/bedeep/bedeepoff. these tools could facilitate minimizing the off-target effects of base editing.",AB_0229
"motivation cancer heterogeneity drastically affects cancer therapeutic outcomes. predicting drug response in vitro is expected to help formulate personalized therapy regimens. in recent years, several computational models based on machine learning and deep learning have been proposed to predict drug response in vitro. however, most of these methods capture drug features based on a single drug description (e.g. drug structure), without considering the relationships between drugs and biological entities (e.g. target, diseases, and side effects). moreover, most of these methods collect features separately for drugs and cell lines but fail to consider the pairwise interactions between drugs and cell lines.results in this paper, we propose a deep learning framework, named msdrp for drug response prediction. msdrp uses an interaction module to capture interactions between drugs and cell lines, and integrates multiple associations/interactions between drugs and biological entities through similarity network fusion algorithms, outperforming some state-of-the-art models in all performance measures for all experiments. the experimental results of de novo test and independent test demonstrate the excellent performance of our model for new drugs. furthermore, several case studies illustrate the rationality for using feature vectors derived from drug similarity matrices from multisource data to represent drugs and the interpretability of our model.availability and implementation the codes of msdrp are available at https://github.com/xyzhang-10/msdrp.",AB_0229
