"motivation proteins play crucial roles in biological processes, with their functions being closely tied to thermodynamic stability. however, measuring stability changes upon point mutations of amino acid residues using physical methods can be time-consuming. in recent years, several computational methods for protein thermodynamic stability prediction (ptsp) based on deep learning have emerged. nevertheless, these approaches either overlook the natural topology of protein structures or neglect the inherent noisy samples resulting from theoretical calculation or experimental errors.results we propose a novel global-local graph neural network powered by unbiased curriculum learning for the ptsp task. our method first builds a siamese graph neural network to extract protein features before and after mutation. since the graph's topological changes stem from local node mutations, we design a local feature transformation module to make the model focus on the mutated site. to address model bias caused by noisy samples, which represent unavoidable errors from physical experiments, we introduce an unbiased curriculum learning method. this approach effectively identifies and re-weights noisy samples during the training process. extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms advanced protein stability prediction methods, and surpasses state-of-the-art learning methods for regression prediction tasks.availability and implementation all code and data is available at https://github.com/haifangong/ucl-glgnn.",AB_0222
"motivation model quality assessment is a crucial part of protein structure prediction and a gateway to proper usage of models in biomedical applications. many methods have been proposed for assessing the quality of structural models of protein monomers, but few methods for evaluating protein complex models. as protein complex structure prediction becomes a new challenge, there is an urgent need for model quality assessment methods that can accurately assess the accuracy of interface residues of complex structures.results here, we present deepumqa3, a web server for evaluating the accuracy of interface residues of protein complex structures using deep neural networks. for an input complex structure, features are extracted from three levels of overall complex, intra-monomer, and inter-monomer, and an improved deep residual neural network is used to predict per-residue lddt and interface residue accuracy. deepumqa3 ranks first in the blind test of interface residue accuracy estimation in casp15, with pearson, spearman, and auc of 0.564, 0.535, and 0.755 under the lddt measurement, which are 17.6%, 23.6%, and 10.9% higher than the second best method, respectively. deepumqa3 can also assess the accuracy of all residues in the entire complex and distinguish high- and low-precision residues.availability and implementation the web sever of deepumqa3 are freely available at http://zhanglab-bioinf.com/deepumqa_server/.",AB_0222
"objective. learning-based histopathology image (hi) classification methods serve as important tools for auxiliary diagnosis in the prognosis stage. however, most existing methods are focus on a single target cancer due to inter-domain differences among different cancer types, limiting their applicability to different cancer types. to overcome these limitations, this paper presents a high-performance hi classification method that aims to address inter-domain differences and provide an improved solution for reliable and practical hi classification. approach. firstly, we collect a high-quality hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) dataset with enough data to verify the stability and practicability of the method. secondly, a novel dual-branch hybrid encoding embedded network is proposed, which integrates the feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural network and transformer. this well-designed structure enables the network to extract diverse features while minimizing redundancy from a single complex network. lastly, we develop a salient area constraint loss function tailored to the unique characteristics of his to address inter-domain differences and enhance the robustness and universality of the methods. main results. extensive experiments have conducted on the proposed hcc dataset and two other publicly available datasets. the proposed method demonstrates outstanding performance with an impressive accuracy of 99.09% on the hcc dataset and achieves state-of-the-art results on the other two public datasets. these remarkable outcomes underscore the superior performance and versatility of our approach in multiple hi classification. significance. the advancements presented in this study contribute to the field of hi analysis by providing a reliable and practical solution for multiple cancer classification, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. our code is available at https://github.com/lms-design/dhee-net.",AB_0222
"aging and cellular senescence are characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, which could be triggered by aging factors such as physiological, pathological and external factors. numerous studies have shown that gene regulatory events play crucial roles in aging, increasing the need for a comprehensive repository of regulatory relationships during aging. here, we established a manually curated database of aging factors (agingreg, https://bio.liclab.net/aging-reg/), focusing on the regulatory relationships during aging with experimental evidence in humans. by curating thousands of published literature, 2157 aging factor entries (1345 aging gene entries, 804 external factor entries and eight aging-related pathway entries) and related regulatory information were manually curated. the regulatory relationships were classified into four types according to their functions: (i) upregulation, which indicates that aging factors upregulate the expression of target genes during aging; (ii) downregulation, which indicates that aging factors downregulate the expression of target genes during aging; (iii) activation, which indicates that aging factors influence the activity of target genes during aging and (iv) inhibition, which indicates that aging factors inhibit the activation of target molecule activity, leading to declined or lost target activity. agingreg involves 651 upregulating pairs, 632 downregulating pairs, 330 activation-regulating pairs and 34 inhibition-regulating pairs, covering 195 disease types and more than 800 kinds of cells and tissues from 1784 published literature studies. agingreg provides a user-friendly interface to query, browse and visualize detailed information about the regulatory relationships during aging. we believe that agingreg will serve as a valuable resource database in the field of aging research.database url: https://bio.liclab.net/aging-reg/",AB_0222
"convolutional neural network (cnn)-based methods facilitate data classification but sacrifice physical interpretability due to the complex model architecture and tight inferring integration. the interpretability requirement of our prior cnn-based golf classifier motivates us to explain the performance of the predictions and to discover the class-discriminative, significant regions of interest within the golf swings as well. this can be done by casting the 2d guided grad-cams to a 1d generalization, which is presented in our current research. we then perform the visualization by inspecting the golf predictions and the involved golf dataset using such a custom 1d guided grad-cam, highlight class-discriminative, significant regions of interest, and finally attempt to present potential interpretations. specifically, we investigate the attention performance and the corresponding potential attributions by visualizing and by evaluating the predictions given by the classifier and the golf swings from five perspectives, including attention consistency within particular classes, the inspections of misclassified swings, guided grad-cam visualizations at different layers, and the attention shift with respect to temporal resolutions and with respect to sensor usages. we conclude that our visual inspections explain our previous classification performance, that the class-discriminative, significant features can be captured, and that every single prediction has its reasonable interpretation, in terms of the comprehensive experiments. such exploration can provide a potential possibility of associating the critical regions and features with the physical movements of golf players, which can possibly contribute to golf training. relevant code files are available at https://github.com/92xianshen/golf-guided-gradcam.",AB_0222
"large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (lsmops) pose a great challenge to maintaining the diversity of solutions. however, existing large-scale multiobjective optimization algorithms (moeas) prefer to directly use environmental selection methods designed for small-scale optimization problems. these methods are not effective in solving complex lsmops. to address this issue, this paper proposes a two-space (decision space and objective space) decomposition (tsd)-based diversity maintenance mechanism. its main idea is to explicitly decompose the decision space and objective space into a number of subspaces, each of which may contain some pareto-optimal solutions. searching for pareto-optimal solutions in these subspaces may help maintain the diversity of solutions. to this end, a diversity design subspace (dds) is constructed to decompose the decision space. then, a large-scale moea (moea/tsd) is designed by using the proposed tsd-based diversity maintenance mechanism. experimental studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed tsd mechanism. compared with nine state-of-the-art large-scale moeas on 112 benchmark lsmops, our proposed algorithm offers considerable advantages in overall optimization performance. the source code of moea/tsd is available at https://github.com/yizhizhede/moeatsd.",AB_0222
"in recent years, drug design has been revolutionized by the application of deep learning techniques, and molecule generation is a crucial aspect of this transformation. however, most of the current deep learning approaches do not explicitly consider and apply scaffold hopping strategy when performing molecular generation. in this work, we propose scaffoldgvae, a variational autoencoder based on multi-view graph neural networks, for scaffold generation and scaffold hopping of drug molecules. the model integrates several important components, such as node-central and edge-central message passing, side-chain embedding, and gaussian mixture distribution of scaffolds. to assess the efficacy of our model, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation and comparison with baseline models based on seven general generative model evaluation metrics and four scaffold hopping generative model evaluation metrics. the results demonstrate that scaffoldgvae can explore the unseen chemical space and generate novel molecules distinct from known compounds. especially, the scaffold hopped molecules generated by our model are validated by the evaluation of graphdta, ledock, and mm/gbsa. the case study of generating inhibitors of lrrk2 for the treatment of pd further demonstrates the effectiveness of scaffoldgvae in generating novel compounds through scaffold hopping. this novel approach can also be applied to other protein targets of various diseases, thereby contributing to the future development of new drugs. source codes and data are available at https://github.com/ecust-hc/scaffoldgvae.",AB_0222
"motivation: cell-cell interactions (ccis) play critical roles in many biological processes such as cellular differentiation, tissue homeostasis, and immune response. with the rapid development of high throughput single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) technologies, it is of high importance to identify ccis from the ever-increasing scrna-seq data. however, limited by the algorithmic constraints, current computational methods based on statistical strategies ignore some key latent information contained in scrna-seq data with high sparsity and heterogeneity. results: here, we developed a deep learning framework named deepcci to identify meaningful ccis from scrna-seq data. applications of deepcci to a wide range of publicly available datasets from diverse technologies and platforms demonstrate its ability to predict significant ccis accurately and effectively. powered by the flexible and easy-to-use software, deepcci can provide the one-stop solution to discover meaningful intercellular interactions and build cci networks from scrna-seq data. availability and implementation: the source code of deepcci is available online at https://github.com/jiangbiolab/deepcci.",AB_0222
