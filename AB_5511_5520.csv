"biomolecular electrostatics is of key importance for biological function and recognition. the continuum electrostatic model based on the poisson-boltzmann (pb) equation has been widely used to study biomolecular electrostatics. the solution of the pb equation gives the electrostatic potential over the space enclosing the molecule(s) of interest, typically obtained at points of a suitable grid. the generalized born (gb) model has been used to provide a useful approximation to the solution obtained by solving numerically the pb equation. the main advantage of the gb approach is to express the electrostatic energy of the system as the sum of pairwise interactions. the latter depend on geometric parameters (the gb radii) which depend on all atoms, and their radii, of the system. in this work we present a tutorial through examples for a more efficient and general version of the program bluues which is able to compute:1) the generalized born radius of each atom;2) the electrostatic potential at the surface of the molecule mapped to solvent accessible atoms;3) the solvent accessible surface in a pdb formatted file;4) the electrostatic potential in the volume surrounding the molecule;5) the electrostatic free energy and different contributions to it;6) the ph-dependent properties of proteins (total charge and ph-dependent free energy of folding) in the ph range -4 to 18;7) the pka shifts due to molecular structure of all ionizable groups. program summary program title: bluues2cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /bx98gcrzbg .1developer's repository link: https://github .com /federico -fogolari /bluues2code ocean capsule: https://codeocean .com /capsule /9338710 licensing provisions: gplv3programming language: cnature of problem: biomolecular electrostatics is of key importance for biological function and recognition. computation of electrostatic effects and their dissection in atomic contributions is a general problem in molecular modeling.solution method: the gbr6 version of the generalized born (gb) model is implemented through surface integrals and all common molecular electrostatic analyses are performed by a single command line program.additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: the program requires, as input, files in pqr format, which may be generated by independent software (e.g. babel, pdb2pqr). for the optional generation of the solvent excluded surface, the software msms must be installed and present in the path.(c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0552
"the availability of high-resolution data and accurate ground truth is essential to evaluate and compare methods and algorithms properly. moreover, it is often difficult to acquire real data for a given application domain that is sufficiently representative and heterogeneous in terms of scene representation, acquisition conditions, point of view, etc. to overcome the limitations of available datasets, this paper presents a new synthetic, multi-purpose dataset called enrich for testing photogrammetric and computer vision algorithms. compared to existing datasets, enrich offers higher resolution images rendered with different lighting conditions, camera orientations, scales, and fields of view. specifically, enrich is composed of three sub-datasets: enrich -aerial, enrich-square, and enrich-statue, each exhibiting different characteristics. we show the usefulness of the proposed dataset on several examples of photogrammetry and computer vision-related tasks such as: evaluation of hand-crafted and deep learning-based local features, effects of ground control points (gcps) configuration on the 3d accuracy, and monocular depth estimation. we make enrich publicly available at: https://github.com/davidemarelli/enrich.",AB_0552
"background: the life sciences are one of the biggest suppliers of scientific data. reusing and connecting these data can uncover hidden insights and lead to new concepts. efficient reuse of these datasets is strongly promoted when they are interlinked with a sufficient amount of machine-actionable metadata. while the fair (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) guiding principles have been accepted by all stakeholders, in practice, there are only a limited number of easy-to-adopt implementations available that fulfill the needs of data producers. findings: we developed the fair data station, a lightweight application written in java, that aims to support researchers in managing research metadata according to the fair principles. it implements the isa metadata framework and uses minimal information metadata standards to capture experiment metadata. the fair data station consists of 3 modules. based on the minimal information model(s) selected by the user, the form generation module creates a metadata template excel workbook with a header row of machine-actionable attribute names. the excel workbook is subsequently used by the data producer(s) as a familiar environment for sample metadata registration. at any point during this process, the format of the recorded values can be checked using the validation module. finally, the resource module can be used to convert the set of metadata recorded in the excel workbook in rdf format, enabling (cross-project) (meta)data searches and, for publishing of sequence data, in an european nucleotide archive-compatible xml metadata file. conclusions: turning fair into reality requires the availability of easy-to-adopt data fairification workflows that are also of direct use for data producers. as such, the fair data station provides, in addition to the means to correctly fairify (omics) data, the means to build searchable metadata databases of similar projects and can assist in ena metadata submission of sequence data. the fair data station is available at https://fairbydesign.nl.",AB_0552
"the fine-grained visual categorization (fgvc) is challenging because the subtle inter-class variations are difficult to be captured. one notable research line uses the global covariance pooling (gcp) layer to learn powerful representations with second-order statistics, which can effectively model inter-class differences. in our previous conference paper, we show that truncating small eigenvalues of the gcp covariance can attain smoother gradient and improve the performance on large-scale benchmarks. however, on fine-grained datasets, truncating the small eigenvalues would make the model fail to converge. this observation contradicts the common assumption that the small eigenvalues merely correspond to the noisy and unimportant information. consequently, ignoring them should have little influence on the performance. to diagnose this peculiar behavior, we propose two attribution methods whose visualizations demonstrate that the seemingly unimportant small eigenvalues are crucial as they are in charge of extracting the discriminative class-specific features. inspired by this observation, we propose a network branch dedicated to magnifying the importance of small eigenvalues. without introducing any additional parameters, this branch simply amplifies the small eigenvalues and achieves state-of-the-art performances of gcp methods on three fine-grained benchmarks. furthermore, the performance is also competitive against other fgvc approaches on larger datasets. code is available at https://github.com/kingjamessong/differentiablesvd.",AB_0552
"automatic lesion segmentation on thoracic ct enables rapid quantitative analysis of lung involvement in covid-19 infections. however, obtaining a large amount of voxel-level annotations for training segmentation networks is prohibitively expensive. therefore, we propose a weakly-supervised segmentation method based on dense regression activation maps (drams). most weakly-supervised segmentation approaches exploit class activation maps (cams) to localize objects. however, because cams were trained for classification, they do not align precisely with the object segmentations. instead, we produce high-resolution activation maps using dense features from a segmentation network that was trained to estimate a per-lobe lesion percentage. in this way, the network can exploit knowledge regarding the required lesion volume. in addition, we propose an attention neural network module to refine drams, optimized together with the main regression task. we evaluated our algorithm on 90 subjects. results show our method achieved 70.2% dice coefficient, substantially outperforming the cam-based baseline at 48.6%. we published our source code at https://github. com/diagnijmegen/bodyct-dram.",AB_0552
"background: high amylose starchy foods modulate the postprandial metabolic response in humans. however, the mechanisms of their metabolic benefits and their impact on the subsequent meal have not been fully elucidated.objective: we aimed to evaluate whether glucose and insulin responses to a standard lunch are influenced by the consumption of amylose-rich bread at breakfast in overweight adults and whether changes in plasma short chain fatty acids (scfas) concentrations contribute to their metabolic effects.methods: using a randomized crossover design, 11 men and 9 women, bmi 30 +/- 3 kg/m2, 48 +/- 19 y, consumed at breakfast 2 breads made with high amylose flour (haf): 85%-haf (180 g) and 75%-haf (170 g), and control bread (120 g) containing 100% conventional flour. plasma samples were collected at fasting, 4 h after breakfast, and 2 h after a standard lunch to measure glucose, insulin, and scfa con-centrations. anova posthoc analyses were used for comparisons.results: postprandial plasma glucose responses were 27% and 39% lower after breakfasts with 85%-and 70%-haf breads than control bread (p = 0.026 and p = 0.003, respectively), with no difference after lunch. insulin responses were not different between the 3 breakfasts, whereas there was a 28% lower response after the lunch following breakfast with 85%-haf bread than the control (p = 0.049). propionate concentrations increased from fasting by 9% and 12% 6 h after breakfasts with 85%-and 70%-haf breads and decreased by 11% with control bread (p < 0.05). at 6 h after breakfast with 70%-haf bread, plasma propionate and insulin were inversely correlated (r = -0.566; p = 0.044).conclusions: amylose-rich bread reduces the postprandial glucose response after breakfast and insulin concentrations after the subsequent lunch in overweight adults. this second meal effect may be mediated by the elevation of plasma propionate due to intestinal fermentation of resistant starch. high amylose products could be a promising tool in a dietary prevention strategy for type 2 diabetes.this trial was registered at clinical trial registry as: nct03899974 (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03899974).",AB_0552
"motivation: gene-disease associations are fundamental for understanding disease etiology and developing effective interventions and treatments. identifying genes not yet associated with a disease due to a lack of studies is a challenging task in which prioritization based on prior knowledge is an important element. the computational search for new candidate disease genes may be eased by positive-unlabeled learning, the machine learning (ml) setting in which only a subset of instances are labeled as positive while the rest of the dataset is unlabeled. in this work, we propose a set of effective network-based features to be used in a novel markov diffusion-based multi-class labeling strategy for putative disease gene discovery. results: the performances of the new labeling algorithm and the effectiveness of the proposed features have been tested on 10 different disease datasets using three ml algorithms. the new features have been compared against classical topological and functional/ontological features and a set of network- and biological-derived features already used in gene discovery tasks. the predictive power of the integrated methodology in searching for new disease genes has been found to be competitive against state-of-the-art algorithms. availability and implementation: the source code of niapu can be accessed at https://github.com/andmastro/ niapu. the source data used in this study are available online on the respective websites. contact: mastropietro@diag.uniroma1.it or davide.vergni@cnr.it supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0552
"background and aim: hdl-cholesterol efflux capacity (cec) has been shown to be a better cardiovascular (cvd) risk marker than serum hdl concentration. several foods and nutrients have been shown to improve hdl functions, however no effective dietetic nor pharmacological strategy is available to increase cec. this study aims to evaluate the possible effect of mediterranean diet (md) and lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet (vd) on hdl function in a group of clinically healthy subjects at low-to-moderate cvd risk. methods and results: thirty apparently healthy subjects with a low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk profile (21 f; mean age: 51.3 +/- 9.7 years) were randomly assigned to a 3-month md or vd diet and then crossed. participants on vd showed a reduction in total hdl cec by 8.99% (p < 0.001) as well as a reduction in abca1 mediate d-cec by 18.62% (p < 0.001) compared to participants on md. regarding cec mediated by aqueous diffusion, no significant changes were observed after treatment with either diet. finally, a significant positive association between cec mediated by the abca1 transporter and adiponectin was found (r = 0.462; p = 0.010). conclusion: the results of this study suggest that hdl activity in promoting cholesterol efflux and thereby reducing the concentration of pro-atherogenic lipoproteins was more effective in participants undergoing md than vd. based on these findings, the md could be considered a better therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular prevention than vd. clinical trial registration url: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. unique identifier: nct02641834.

"background and aims: type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) is an important risk factor for peripheral artery disease (pad). ankle-brachial index (abi) was found associated with a higher cardiovascular (cv) risk and mortality. the main goals of this study were to establish the prev-alence of pad in a t2dm population, and assess the relationship between pad and the cv risk calculated with the cuore project score (cps) (https://www.cuore.iss.it/). the association between the abi, the main risk factors for pad and t2dm complications was also investigated.methods and results: two hundred patients were consecutively enrolled. the prevalence of pad in this population was 17%. the cv risk tended to be higher (p = 0.0712) in the group with a pathological abi than in the group with a normal abi. glycated hemoglobin (r =-0.1591; p = 0.0244), total cholesterol (r =-0.1958; p = 0.0054), ldl cholesterol (r =-0.1708; p = 0.0156) and systolic blood pressure (r =-0.1523; p = 0.0313) correlated significantly and inversely with the left abi. the frequency of diabetic retinopathy was significantly higher in the group with a pathological abi (p = 0.0316).conclusions: the data reveal a high prevalence of pad in patients with t2dm. the cps confirmed that patients with a pathological abi have tendency to a higher cv risk. the results point to the importance of an accurate cv assessment -also measuring individuals' abi and calculating their cps -to better pinpoint those at high risk of pad, especially among patients with t2dm.(c) 2022 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of the italian diabetes society, the italian society for the study of atherosclerosis, the italian society of human nutrition and the department of clinical medicine and surgery, federico ii university. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0552
"this paper introduces an experimental setup for retrieving horizontal wind speed and direction profiles with a high temporal and vertical resolution for process studies and validation of convection-permitting model simulations. the cmtrace (tracing convective momentum transport in complex cloudy atmospheres) campaign used collocated wind lidar and cloud radar measurements to retrieve seamless wind profiles from near the surface up to cloud tops. it took place in cabauw, the netherlands, between 13 september and 3 october 2021. the intermediate processing steps for generating the level 1 and level 2 data, such as second trip echoes filtering, offset correction, wind retrieval, re-gridding, and flagging, are described. in level 1 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6926483, dias neto, 2022a), the data from lidar and radars are kept in the original spatial and temporal resolution, while in level 2 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6926605, dias neto, 2022b), they are regridded to a common spatial and temporal resolution. statistical analyses of the lidar's and radar's wind speed and direction profiles indicate a correlation higher than 0.95 for both variables. the bias of wind direction and speed calculated between radar's and lidar's observations are 0.24? and -0.16 ms(-1), respectively. the foreseen initial application of the datasets includes the study of convective momentum transport and its validation in regional weather forecasts and large-eddy simulation hindcasts.",AB_0552
