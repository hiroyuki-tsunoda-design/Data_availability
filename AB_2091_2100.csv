"the aim of the study is to establish an online database for predicting protein structures altered in ocular diseases by alphafold2 and rosettafold algorithms. totally, 726 genes of multiple ocular diseases were collected for protein structure prediction. both alphafold2 and rosettafold algorithms were built locally using the open-source codebases. a dataset with 48 protein structures from protein data bank (pdb) was adopted for algorithm set-up validation. a website was built to match ocular genes with the corresponding predicted tertiary protein structures for each amino acid sequence. the predicted local distance difference test-c alpha (plddt) and template modeling (tm) scores of the validation protein structure and the selected ocular genes were evaluated. molecular dynamics and molecular docking simulations were performed to demonstrate the applications of the predicted structures. for the validation dataset, 70.8% of the predicted protein structures showed plddt greater than 90. compared to the pdb structures, 100% of the alphafold2-predicted structures and 97.9% of the rosettafold-predicted structure showed tm score greater than 0.5. totally, 1329 amino acid sequences of 430 ocular disease-related genes have been predicted, of which 75.9% showed plddt greater than 70 for the wildtype sequences and 76.1% for the variant sequences. small molecule docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the predicted protein structures with higher confidence scores showed similar molecular characteristics with the structures from pdb. we have developed an ocular protein structure database (eyeprodb) for ocular disease, which is released for the public and will facilitate the biological investigations and structure-based drug development for ocular diseases.database url: http://eyeprodb.jsiec.org",AB_0210
"addition of chemical structural information in enzymatic reactions has proven to be significant for accurate enzyme function prediction. however, such chemical data lack systematic feature mining and hardly exist in enzyme-related databases. therefore, global mining of enzymatic reactions will offer a unique landscape for researchers to understand the basic functional mechanisms of natural bioprocesses and facilitate enzyme function annotation. here, we established a new knowledge base called enzymine, through which we propose to elucidate enzymatic reaction features and then link them with sequence and structural annotations. enzymine represents an advanced database that extends enzyme knowledge by incorporating reaction chemical feature strategies, strengthening the connectivity between enzyme and metabolic reactions. therefore, it has the potential to reveal many new metabolic pathways involved with given enzymes, as well as expand enzyme function annotation.database url: http://www.rxnfinder.org/enzymine/",AB_0210
"background: pan-cancer analysis examines both the commonalities and heterogeneity among genomic and cellular alterations across numerous types of tumors. pan-cancer analysis of gene expression, tumor mutational burden (tmb), microsatellite instability (msi), and tumor immune microenvironment (time), and methylation becomes available based on the multi-omics data from the cancer genome atlas program (tcga). some online tools provide analysis of gene and protein expression, mutation, methylation, and survival for tcga data. however, these online tools were either uni-functional or were not able to perform analysis of user-defined functions. therefore, we created the tcgaplot r package to facilitate perform pan-cancer analysis and visualization of the built-in multi-omic tcga data.results: tcgaplot provides several functions to perform pan-cancer paired/unpaired differential gene expression analysis, pan-cancer correlation analysis between gene expression and tmb, msi, time, and promoter methylation. functions for visualization include paired/unpaired boxplot, survival plot, roc curve, heatmap, scatter, radar chart, and forest plot. moreover, gene set based pan-cancer and tumor specific analyses were also available. finally, all these built-in multi-omic data could be extracted for implementation for user-defined functions, making the pan-cancer analysis much more convenient.\conclusions: we developed an r-package for integrative pan-cancer analysis and visualization of tcga multi-omics data. the source code and pre-built package are available at github (https://github.com/tjhwangxiong/tcgaplot).",AB_0210
"abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa), an extremely dangerous vascular disease with high mortality, causes massive internal bleeding due to aneurysm rupture. to boost the research on aaa, efforts should be taken to organize and link the information about aaa-related genes and their functions. currently, most researchers screen through genetic databases manually, which is cumbersome and time-consuming. here, we developed aaakb a manually curated knowledgebase containing genes, snps and pathways associated with aaa. in order to facilitate researchers to further explore the mechanism network of aaa, aaakb provides predicted genes that are potentially associated with aaa. the prediction is based on the protein interaction information of genes collected in the database, and the random forest algorithm (rf) is used to build the prediction model. some of these predicted genes are differentially expressed in patients with aaa, and some have been reported to play a role in other cardiovascular diseases, illustrating the utility of the knowledgebase in predicting novel genes. also, aaakb integrates a protein interaction visualization tool to quickly determine the shortest paths between target proteins. as the first knowledgebase to provide a comprehensive catalog of aaa-related genes, aaakb will be an ideal research platform for aaa. database url: http://www.lqlgroup.cn:3838/aaakb/.",AB_0210
"motivation longer reads produced by pacbio or oxford nanopore sequencers could more frequently span the breakpoints of structural variations (svs) than shorter reads. therefore, existing long-read mapping methods often generate wrong alignments and variant calls. compared to deletions and insertions, inversion events are more difficult to be detected since the anchors in inversion regions are nonlinear to those in sv-free regions. to address this issue, this study presents a novel long-read mapping algorithm (named as invmap).results for each long noisy read, invmap first locates the aligned region with a specifically designed scoring method for chaining, then checks the remaining anchors in the aligned region to discover potential inversions. we benchmark invmap on simulated datasets across different genomes and sequencing coverages, experimental results demonstrate that invmap is more accurate to locate aligned regions and call svs for inversions than the competing methods. the real human genome sequencing dataset of na12878 illustrates that invmap can effectively find more candidate variant calls for inversions than the competing methods.availability and implementation the invmap software is available at https://github.com/zhang134/invmap.git.",AB_0210
"motivation single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) technology has enabled discovering gene expression patterns at single cell resolution. however, due to technical limitations, there are usually excessive zeros, called dropouts, in scrna-seq data, which may mislead the downstream analysis. therefore, it is crucial to impute these dropouts to recover the biological information.results we propose a two-step imputation method called tsimpute to impute scrna-seq data. at the first step, tsimpute adopts zero-inflated negative binomial distribution to discriminate dropouts from true zeros and performs initial imputation by calculating the expected expression level. at the second step, it conducts clustering with this modified expression matrix, based on which the final distance weighted imputation is performed. numerical results based on both simulated and real data show that tsimpute achieves favorable performance in terms of gene expression recovery, cell clustering, and differential expression analysis.availability and implementation the r package of tsimpute is available at https://github.com/zhengweihuaynu/tsimpute.",AB_0210
"in the application of driverless technology, current traffic sign recognition methods are susceptible to the influence of ambient light interference, target size changes and complex backgrounds, resulting in reduced recognition accuracy. to address these challenges, this study introduces an optimisation algorithm called etsr-yolo, which is based on the yolov5s algorithm. first, this study improves the path aggregation network (panet) of yolov5s to enhance multi-scale feature fusion by generating an additional high-resolution feature layer to improve the recognition of yolov5s for small-sized objects. second, the study introduces two improved c3 modules that aim to suppress background noise interference and enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the network. finally, the study uses the wise-iou (wiou) function in the post-processing stage to improve the learning ability and robustness of the algorithm to different samples. the experimental results show that etsr-yolo improves map@0.5 by 6.6% on the tsinghua-tencent 100k (tt100k) dataset and by 1.9% on the csust chinese traffic sign detection benchmark 2021 (cctsdb2021) dataset. in the experiments conducted on the embedded computing platform, etsr-yolo demonstrates a short average inference time, thereby affirming its capability to deliver dependable traffic sign detection for intelligent vehicles operating in real-world traffic scenes. the source code and test results of the models used in this study are available at https://github.com/cbrook16/etsr-yolo.",AB_0210
"hp501 is a highly selective renal urate transporter 1 (urat1) inhibitor used for treating hyperuricemia. this study aimed to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of hp501 in male chinese patients. patients with hyperuricemia were sequentially assigned to receive oral doses of hp501 (30, 50, 60, 90, and 120 mg) as a single dose on day 1 and as once-daily doses from days 4 to 13. safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data were collected. multiple oral doses of hp501 were well-tolerated in all the cohorts. the most common adverse events (>= 10% of patients) of any grade regardless of drug relationship were gout flare (14 patients, 25.93%), diarrhea (12 patients, 22.22%), elevated alt (8 patients, 14.81%), hypertriglyceridemia (7 patients, 12.96%), dry mouth (7 patients, 12.96%) and oral ulcer (7 patients, 12.96%). all adverse events were mild or moderate. the cmax and exposure (auc) of hp501 was approximately dose-proportional between 30 and 120 mg. a dose-dependent serum uric acid (ua)-lowering effect was observed in the dose range of 30 to 60 mg and the serum ua lowering effect was similar between 90 and 120 mg on day 13, indicating that the maximal serum ua lowering effect of hp501 was achieved at 90 mg in the patients with hyperuricemia. in conclusion, the tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics supported 90 mg hp501 for subsequent clinical studies of this highly selective urat1 inhibitor.clinical trial registration: no. ctr20212259 (http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn/) was registered in september 2021, and no. ctr20222257 was registered in september 2022.",AB_0210
"densely measured snp data are routinely analyzed but face challenges due to its high dimensionality, especially when gene-environment interactions are incorporated. in recent literature, a functional analysis strategy has been developed, which treats dense snp measurements as a realization of a genetic function and can 'bypass' the dimensionality challenge. however, there is a lack of portable and friendly software, which hinders practical utilization of these functional methods. we fill this knowledge gap and develop the r package functansnp. this comprehensive package encompasses estimation, identification, and visualization tools and has undergone extensive testing using both simulated and real data, confirming its reliability. functansnp can serve as a convenient and reliable tool for analyzing snp and other densely measured data. availability and implementation: the package is available at https://cran.r-project.org/package=functansnp.",AB_0210
"motivation identifying the functional sites of a protein, such as the binding sites of proteins, peptides, or other biological components, is crucial for understanding related biological processes and drug design. however, existing sequence-based methods have limited predictive accuracy, as they only consider sequence-adjacent contextual features and lack structural information.results in this study, deepprosite is presented as a new framework for identifying protein binding site that utilizes protein structure and sequence information. deepprosite first generates protein structures from esmfold and sequence representations from pretrained language models. it then uses graph transformer and formulates binding site predictions as graph node classifications. in predicting protein-protein/peptide binding sites, deepprosite outperforms state-of-the-art sequence- and structure-based methods on most metrics. moreover, deepprosite maintains its performance when predicting unbound structures, in contrast to competing structure-based prediction methods. deepprosite is also extended to the prediction of binding sites for nucleic acids and other ligands, verifying its generalization capability. finally, an online server for predicting multiple types of residue is established as the implementation of the proposed deepprosite.availability and implementation the datasets and source codes can be accessed at https://github.com/weilab-biology/deepprosite. the proposed deepprosite can be accessed at https://inner.wei-group.net/deepprosite/.",AB_0210
