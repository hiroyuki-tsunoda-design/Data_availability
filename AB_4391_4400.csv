"type ia supernova explosions (sn ia) are fundamental sources of elements for the chemical evolution of galaxies. they efficiently produce intermediate-mass (with z between 11 and 20) and iron group elements-for example, about 70% of the solar iron is expected to be made by sn ia. in this work, we calculate complete abundance yields for 39 models of sn ia explosions, based on three progenitors-a 1.4 m-circle dot deflagration detonation model, a 1.0 m-circle dot double detonation model, and a 0.8 m-circle dot double detonation model-and 13 metallicities, with ne-22 mass fractions of 0, 1 x 10(-7), 1 x 10(-6), 1 x 10(-5), 1 x 10(-4), 1 x 10(-3), 2 x 10(-3), 5 x 10(-3), 1 x 10(-2), 1.4 x 10(-2), 5 x 10(-2), and 0.1, respectively. nucleosynthesis calculations are done using the nugrid suite of codes, using a consistent nuclear reaction network between the models. complete tables with yields and production factors are provided online at zenodo:yields (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8060323). we discuss the main properties of our yields in light of the present understanding of sn ia nucleosynthesis, depending on different progenitor mass and composition. finally, we compare our results with a number of relevant models from the literature.",AB_0440
"background:evidence-based hemostatic treatment for intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) associated with non-vitamin k antagonist oral anticoagulants (noacs) is lacking. tranexamic acid (txa) is an antifibrinolytic drug potentially limiting hematoma expansion. we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of txa in noac-ich.methods:we performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial at 6 swiss stroke centers. patients with noac-ich within 12 hours of symptom onset and 48 hours of last noac intake were randomized (1:1) to receive either intravenous txa (1 g over 10 minutes followed by 1 g over 8 hours) or matching placebo in addition to standard medical care via a centralized web-based procedure with minimization on key prognostic factors. all participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. primary outcome was hematoma expansion, defined as & ge;33% relative or & ge;6 ml absolute volume increase at 24 hours and analyzed using logistic regression adjusted for baseline hematoma volume on an intention-to-treat basis.results:between december 12, 2016, and september 30, 2021, we randomized 63 patients (median age, 82 years [interquartile range, 76-86]; 40% women; median hematoma volume, 11.5 [4.8-27.4] ml) of the 109 intended sample size before premature trial discontinuation due to exhausted funding. the primary outcome did not differ between txa (n=32) and placebo (n=31) arms (12 [38%] versus 14 [45%]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.63 [95% ci, 0.22-1.82]; p=0.40). there was a signal for interaction with onset-to-treatment time (pinteraction=0.024), favoring txa when administered within 6 hours of symptom onset. between the txa and placebo arms, the proportion of participants who died (15 [47%] versus 13 [42%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.07 [0.37-3.04]; p=0.91) or had major thromboembolic complications within 90 days (4 [13%] versus 2 [6%]; odds ratio, 1.86 [0.37-9.50]; p=0.45) did not differ. all thromboembolic events occurred at least 2 weeks after study treatment, exclusively in participants not restarted on oral anticoagulation.conclusions:in a smaller-than-intended noac-ich patient sample, we found no evidence that txa prevents hematoma expansion, but there were no major safety concerns. larger trials on hemostatic treatments targeting an early treatment window are needed for noac-ich.registration:url: https://clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct02866838.",AB_0440
"background: tezepelumab, a human monoclonal antibody, blocks thymic stromal lymphopoietin. in the phase 3 navigator study, tezepelumab reduced exacerbations and improved lung function, asthma control, and health-related quality of life compared with placebo in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma. however, lit-tle is known about the impact of tezepelumab on healthcare utilization (hcu) in these patients. objective: to evaluate to what extent tezepelumab reduces patients' hcu. methods: in navigator, patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous tezepelumab 210 mg or placebo, every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. for this analysis, the main outcomes of interest were asthma-related hcu. a blinded, systematic analysis of the symptoms and hcu recorded in the investigator-reported narratives describ-ing exacerbation-related hospitalizations was also conducted; the narratives included blinded ratings of event intensity, recorded as mild, moderate, or severe. results: recipients of tezepelumab (n = 528) required fewer asthma-related unscheduled specialist visits (teze-pelumab, 285 events; placebo, 406 events), telephone calls with a healthcare provider (tezepelumab, 234; pla-cebo, 599), ambulance transports (tezepelumab, 5; placebo, 22), emergency department visits (without subsequent hospitalization; tezepelumab, 16; placebo, 37), hospitalizations (tezepelumab, 14; placebo, 78), and intensive care days (tezepelumab, 0; placebo, 31) than did recipients of placebo (n = 531). among patients with asthma exacerbation-related hospitalizations, 38% of those hospitalized and receiving tezepelumab (5/13) had an event rated as severe, compared with 82% of those hospitalized and receiving placebo (32/39). conclusion: tezepelumab substantially reduced hcu across all outcomes measured compared with placebo, in addition to the severity of asthma exacerbations requiring hospitalization. tezepelumab can reduce the overall burden of disease of severe, uncontrolled asthma. clinical trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home), identifier: nct03347279 (c) 2023 american college of allergy, asthma & immunology. published by elsevier inc. this is an open access arti-cle under the cc by license ()",AB_0440
"background: appendicitis places a substantial burden on healthcare systems, with acute appendicitis alone being the most common abdominal surgical emergency worldwide. further characterisation of the disease burden in eu15+ countries may help optimise the distribution of healthcare resources. the aim of this observational study was to assess the trends in mortality, incidence and disability-adjusted life-years (dalys) of appendicitis across european union (eu) 15+ countries between the years 1990 and 2019, supplemental digital content 3, http://links.lww.com/js9/a589. materials and methods: age-standardised mortality rates (asmrs), age-standardised incidence rates (asirs) and dalys data for appendicitis in males and females were extracted from the 2019 global burden of disease (gbd) study. temporal trends within the study period were analysed using joinpoint regression analysis. results: the median asmrs across eu15+ countries in 2019 were 0.08/100 000 and 0.13/100 000 for females and males, respectively. between 1990 and 2019 the median percentage change in asmr was -52.12% for females and -53.18% in males. the median asirs in 2019 for females and males were 251/100 000 and 278/100 000, respectively, with a median percentage change of +7.22% for females and +3.78% for males during the observation period. decreasing trends in dalys were observed over the 30-year study period, with median percentage changes of -23.57% and -33.81% for females and males, respectively, supplemental digital content 3, http://links.lww.com/js9/a589. conclusion: overall, a general trend of decreasing appendicitis asmrs and dalys was observed across eu15+ countries, despite small overall increases in appendicitis asirs, supplemental digital content 3, http://links.lww.com/js9/a589. variations in both diagnostic and management strategies over the study period are likely contributory to the changing trends.",AB_0440

"motivation molecular docking is a commonly used approach for estimating binding conformations and their resultant binding affinities. machine learning has been successfully deployed to enhance such affinity estimations. many methods of varying complexity have been developed making use of some or all the spatial and categorical information available in these structures. the evaluation of such methods has mainly been carried out using datasets from pdbbind. particularly the comparative assessment of scoring functions (casf) 2007, 2013, and 2016 datasets with dedicated test sets. this work demonstrates that only a small number of simple descriptors is necessary to efficiently estimate binding affinity for these complexes without the need to know the exact binding conformation of a ligand.results the developed approach of using a small number of ligand and protein descriptors in conjunction with gradient boosting trees demonstrates high performance on the casf datasets. this includes the commonly used benchmark casf2016 where it appears to perform better than any other approach. this methodology is also useful for datasets where the spatial relationship between the ligand and protein is unknown as demonstrated using a large chembl-derived dataset.availability and implementation code and data uploaded to https://github.com/abbiar/plbaffinity.",AB_0440
"wildfire behaviour depends on complex interactions between fuels, topography, and weather over a wide range of scales, being important for fire research and management applications. to allow for significant progress towards better fire management, the operational and research communities require detailed open data on observed wildfire behaviour. here, we present the portuguese large wildfire spread database (pt-firesprd) that includes the reconstruction of the spread of 80 large wildfires that occurred in portugal between 2015 and 2021. it includes a detailed set of fire behaviour descriptors, such as rate of spread (ros), fire growth rate (fgr), and fire radiative energy (fre). the wildfires were reconstructed by converging evidence from complementary data sources, such as satellite imagery and products, airborne and ground data collected by fire personnel, and official fire data and information in external reports. we then implemented a digraph-based algorithm to estimate the fire behaviour descriptors and combined it with the meteosat second generation (msg) spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager (seviri) fire radiative power estimates. a total of 1197 ros and fgr estimates were calculated along with 609 fre estimates. the extreme fires of 2017 were responsible for the maximum observed values of ros (8900 m h(-1)) and fgr (4400 ha h(-1)). combining both descriptors, we describe the fire behaviour distribution using six percentile intervals that can be easily communicated to both research and management communities. analysis of the database showed that burned extent is mostly determined by fgr rather than by ros. finally, we explored a practical example to show how the pt-firesprd database can be used to study the dynamics of individual wildfires and to build robust case studies for training and capacity building.the pt-firesprd is the first open-access fire progression and behaviour database in mediterranean europe, dramatically expanding the extant information. updating the pt-firesprd database will require a continuous joint effort by researchers and fire personnel. pt-firesprd data are publicly available through https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7495506 (benali et al., 2022) and have large potential to improve current knowledge on wildfire behaviour and to support better decision making.",AB_0440
"extracting high ranking or prime protein targets (ppts) as potent mrsa drug candidates from a given set of ligands is a key challenge in efficient molecular docking. this study combines protein-versus-ligand matching molecular docking (md) data extracted from 10 independent molecular docking (md) evaluations - adfr, dock, gemdock, ledock, plants, psovina, quickvina2, smina, vina, and vinaxb to identify top mrsa drug candidates. twenty-nine active protein targets (apt) from the enhanced dud-e repository (http://dud-e.decoys.org) are matched against 1040 ligands using forward modeling machine learning for initial data mining and modeling (ddm) to extract ppts and the corresponding high affinity ligands (hals). k-means clustering (kmc) is then performed on 400 ligands matched against 29 pts, with each cluster accommodating hals, and the corresponding ppts. performance of kmc is then validated against randomly chosen head, tail, and middle active ligands (als). kmc outcomes have been validated against two other clustering methods, namely, gaussian mixture model (gmm) and density based spatial clustering of applications with noise (dbscan). while gmm shows similar results as with kmc, dbscan has failed to yield more than one cluster and handle the noise (outliers), thus affirming the choice of kmc or gmm. databases obtained from adfr to mine ppts are then ranked according to the number of the corresponding hal-ppt combinations (hpc) inside the derived clusters, an approach called reverse modeling (rm). from the set of 29 pts studied, rm predicts high fidelity of 5 ppts (17%) that bind with 76 out of 400, i.e., 19% ligands leading to a prediction of next-generation mrsa drug candidates: ppt2 (average hpc is 41.1%) is the top choice, followed by ppt14 (average hpc 25.46%), and then ppt15 (average hpc 23.12%). this algorithm can be generically implemented irrespective of pathogenic forms and is particularly effective for sparse data.",AB_0440
"background all cancers harbor somatic mutations in their genomes. in principle, mutations affecting between one and fifty base pairs are generally classified as small mutational events. conversely, large mutational events affect more than fifty base pairs, and, in most cases, they encompass copy-number and structural variants affecting many thousands of base pairs. prior studies have demonstrated that examining patterns of somatic mutations can be leveraged to provide both biological and clinical insights, thus, resulting in an extensive repertoire of tools for evaluating small mutational events. recently, classification schemas for examining large-scale mutational events have emerged and shown their utility across the spectrum of human cancers. however, there has been no computationally efficient bioinformatics tool that allows visualizing and exploring these large-scale mutational events.results here, we present a new version of sigprofilermatrixgenerator that now delivers integrated capabilities for examining large mutational events. the tool provides support for examining copy-number variants and structural variants under two previously developed classification schemas and it supports data from numerous algorithms and data modalities. sigprofilermatrixgenerator is written in python with an r wrapper package provided for users that prefer working in an r environment.conclusions the new version of sigprofilermatrixgenerator provides the first standardized bioinformatics tool for optimized exploration and visualization of two previously developed classification schemas for copy number and structural variants. the tool is freely available at https://github.com/alexandrovlab/sigprofilermatrixgenerator with an extensive documentation at https://osf.io/s93d5/wiki/home/.",AB_0440
"background cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cscc) is a common skin cancer, affecting more than 2 million people worldwide yearly and metastasising in 2-5% of patients. however, current clinical staging systems do not provide estimates of absolute metastatic risk, hence missing the opportunity for more personalised treatment advice. we aimed to develop a clinico-pathological model that predicts the probability of metastasis in patients with cscc. methods nationwide cohorts from (1) all patients with a first primary cscc in the netherlands in 2007-2008 and (2) all patients with a cscc in 2013-2015 in england were used to derive nested case-control cohorts. pathology records of primary csccs that originated a loco-regional or distant metastasis were identified, and these csccs were matched to primary csccs of controls without metastasis (1:1 ratio). the model was developed on the dutch cohort (n = 390) using a weighted cox regression model with backward selection and validated on the english cohort (n = 696). model performance was assessed using weighted versions of the c-index, calibration metrics, and decision curve analysis; and compared to the brigham and women's hospital (bwh) and the american joint committee on cancer (ajcc) staging systems. members of the multidisciplinary skin cancer outcomes (scout) consortium were surveyed to interpret metastatic risk cutoffs in a clinical context.findings eight out of eleven clinico-pathological variables were selected. the model showed good discriminative ability, with an optimism-corrected c-index of 0.80 (95% confidence interval (ci) 0.75-0.85) in the development cohort and a c-index of 0.84 (95% ci 0.81-0.87) in the validation cohort. model predictions were well-calibrated: the calibration slope was 0.96 (95% ci 0.76-1.16) in the validation cohort. decision curve analysis showed improved net benefit compared to current staging systems, particularly for thresholds relevant for decisions on follow-up and adjuvant treatment. the model is available as an online web-based calculator (https://emcdermatology.shinyapps.io/cscc-abs-met-risk/). interpretation this validated model assigns personalised metastatic risk predictions to patients with cscc, using routinely reported histological and patient-specific risk factors. the model can empower clinicians and healthcare systems in identifying patients with high-risk cscc and offering personalised care/treatment and follow-up. use of the model for clinical decision-making in different patient populations must be further investigated.funding ppp allowance made available by health-holland, top sector life sciences & health, to stimulate public private partnerships.",AB_0440
