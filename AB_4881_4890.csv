"ongoing atmospheric warming has accelerated glacier mass loss in many mountain regions worldwide. glacier lakes trap part of the glacial meltwater and have increased by about 50 % in number and area since the 1990s. some of these glacier lakes may empty catastrophically and pose hazards to mountain communities, infrastructure, and habitats. such glacier lake outburst floods (glofs) have caused millions of dollars of damages and fatalities and are one of many concerns about future changes in the magnitude, frequency, and impacts of processes of a shrinking mountain cryosphere. consistently compiled inventories are thus vital to assess regional and local trends in glof occurrence, hazard, and risk. to this end, we studied 769 literature and internet sources and developed a standardized database with 57 attributes that describe and quantify the location, dam type, size, timing, and impacts of glofs in nine glaciated mountain regions. our glof inventory also includes details about the lake area before and after the outburst for 391 cases that we manually mapped from optical satellite images since 1984. in total, we compiled 3151 reported glofs that occurred in 27 countries between 850 and 2022 ce. most glofs have been reported in nw north america (26 %) and iceland (19 %). however, the reporting density in our inventory varies. during the 20th century alone, the number of yearly documented glofs increased 6-fold. less than one-quarter of all reported cases feature hydrodynamic characteristics such as flood peak discharge or volume or estimates of loss and damage. our inventory more than doubles the number of reported glofs in a previous global inventory, though gaps in attributes remain. our data collection process emphasizes the support of local experts in contributing previously undocumented cases, and we recommend applying protocols when reporting new cases. the global database on historic glofs is archived at (lutzow and veh, 2023a) and regularly updated at http://glofs.geoecology.uni-potsdam.de/ (last access: 9 may 2023).",AB_0489
"motivation: personalized decision-making for cancer therapy relies on molecular profiling from sequencing data in combination with database evidence and expert knowledge. molecular tumor boards (mtbs) bring together clinicians and scientists with diverse expertise and are increasingly established in the clinical routine for therapeutic interventions. however, the analysis and documentation of patients data are still time-consuming and difficult to manage for mtbs, especially as few tools are available for the amount of information required. results: to overcome these limitations, we developed an interactive web application ambar (alteration annotations for molecular tumor boards), for therapeutic decision-making support in mtbs. ambar is an r shiny-based application that allows customization, interactive filtering, visualization, adding expert knowledge, and export to clinical systems of annotated mutations. availability: ambar is dockerized, open source and available at https://sysbio.uni-ulm.de/?software: ambar",AB_0489
"iguanodontia is a diverse clade of herbivorous ornithischian dinosaurs that were speciose and abundant during the jurassic and cretaceous. although the monophyly of iguanodontia is well supported, their internal relationships have sparked heated debate due to several phylogenetic paradigm shifts. late jurassic basally branching iguanodontians in particular are not well understood in terms of their systematic affinities and evolutionary relevance. their fossil record in europe is meager compared with north america, with only a few species currently recognized. two taxa are currently known from the upper jurassic of england, the basally branching styracosternan cumnoria prestwichii and the putative dryosaurid callovosaurus leedsi. in the upper jurassic of portugal, the styracosternan draconyx loureiroi and the dryosaurid eousdryosaurus nanohallucis are presently the only described basally branching iguanodontians. here we report a new species of early diverging iguanodontian from the upper jurassic lourinha formation of western-central portugal. the new species is clearly distinguished from all other coeval taxa by an exclusive combination of characters that include a tibia with a cnemial crest that is directed craniolaterally and a fibular condyle that is angled at 90 degrees with respect to the proximal epiphysis, a fibula with symmetrical proximal margins, and a reduced metatarsal i. the phylogenetic relationships of the lourinha iguanodontian were explored using maximum parsimony and bayesian inference. the two analyses recover the lourinha iguanodontian as an indeterminate dryomorphan, with more precise affinities precluded due to the current available material. body size is estimated between 3 and 4 meters for the holotype specimen, adding to the diversity of small ornithopods already recognized in the paleoichnological record of the lourinha formation.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:5f4d52d0-0f0b-4809-8561-be58c7c97d45",AB_0489
"the most widely used multi-view clustering approaches can be classified into different groups: subspace multi-view clustering algorithms, multi-view kernel approaches, matrix factorization approaches, and spectral clustering algorithms. most approaches rely on combining predefined individual similarity matrices from multiple views, and then estimate the common similarity matrix. therefore, their performance can be severely affected by noisy original similarity matrices. moreover, most of these methods integrate different spectral projection matrices of each view together, which can also affect the clustering results.to address these shortcomings, we propose a single-phase multiview clustering method with consensus graph learning and spectral representation (mcglsr) in this paper. instead of directly integrating the similarity matrices of the different views, which could introduce noise, our proposed method jointly generates similarity graphs of the views and their common similarity matrix (graph matrix) using a unified global objective function. at this stage, the similarity matrices of the different views are enforced to be sufficiently similar, which eliminates the problem of noise and promotes a clearer unified data structure. moreover, our proposed objective function is able to recover the common spectral projection and soft cluster assignments based on the common graph structure. the proposed method takes as input a kernelized representation of the views features and directly provides the individual graphs, the common graph, the common spectral representation, and the cluster assignments. our technique allows us to obtain the final cluster assignments without requiring an external clustering algorithm. several real-world datasets are used to evaluate our technique and demonstrate its efficacy. the code of the proposed method will be available at the following link: https://github .com /sallyhajjar /mcglsr .git.",AB_0489
"we introduce a novel framework of continuous-time ultra-wideband-inertial sensor fusion for online motion estimation. quaternion-based cubic cumulative b-splines are exploited for parameterizing motion states continuously over time. systematic derivations of analytic kinematic interpolations and spatial differentiations are further provided. based thereon, a new sliding-window spline fitting scheme is established for asynchronous multi-sensor fusion and online calibration. we conduct a dedicated validation of the quaternion spline fitting method, and evaluate the proposed system, sfuise (spline fusion-based ultra-wideband-inertial state estimation), in real-world scenarios using public data set and experiments. the proposed sensor fusion system is real-time capable and delivers superior performance over state-of-the-art discrete-time schemes. we release the source code and own experimental data at https://github.com/kit-isas/sfuise.",AB_0489
"objectives. to analyze variation in end-of-life trajectories with regard to elder care and medical care and how they relate to age, gender, and causes of death.methods. we analyzed all deaths of persons at age 70 years and older between the years 2018 and 2020 in sweden, using a linkage of population registers. we applied latent class analysis to identify distinct types of end-of-life trajectories.results. we identified 6 different types of end-of-life trajectories. the types differed substantially in the amount of utilized elder care and medical care before death. deaths characterized by high levels of elder care and medical care utilization become more common with age. the trajectory types show distinct cause-of-death profiles. conclusions. most deaths today do not comply with what is often referred to as a good death (e.g., retaining control or requiring low levels of elder care). the results suggest that longer lifespans partly result from a prolonged dying process.public health implications. the current modes of dying call for a discussion about how we want to die in an era of increasing lifespans and aging societies.

"among various arithmetic circuits, dividers are one of the costliest in terms of area, energy, and delay. hence, approximate divider designs have been implemented to reduce their cost for error-resilient applications. however, approximate dividers based on memristors for in-memory computing (imc) have not received any attention. in this brief, we propose a library of 16 by 8 approximate restoring array dividers suitable for memristor-based imc that can be used as benchmark circuits. we developed these benchmark circuits by performing an exhaustive design space exploration based on functional approximation. we used the state-of-the-art mapping tool, simpler, to perform the mapping of the divider design to the memristor crossbar. we identified the pareto optimal approximate divider designs based on the magic design style with varying output qualities. we compare our pareto optimal designs with the existing state-of-the-art cmos-based approximate divider designs when mapped to imcs. we also performed a case study on two image processing applications. overall we propose maradiv, a library of magic design style-based approximate restoring array divider benchmark circuits tailored for memristor-based imc. we believe that maradiv's benchmark designs can be used for future research in this direction. hence, all pareto optimal approximate restoring array divider designs will be made available at https://github.com/agra-uni-bremen/tcasii2022-maradiv-lib.",AB_0489
"event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that measure per-pixel brightness differences asynchronously. recovering brightness from events is appealing since the reconstructed images inherit the high dynamic range (hdr) and high-speed properties of events; hence they can be used in many robotic vision applications and to generate slow-motion hdr videos. however, state-of-the-art methods tackle this problem by training an event-to-image recurrent neural network (rnn), which lacks explainability and is difficult to tune. in this work we show, for the first time, how tackling the combined problem of motion and brightness estimation leads us to formulate event-based image reconstruction as a linear inverse problem that can be solved without training an image reconstruction rnn. instead, classical and learning-based regularizers are used to solve the problem and remove artifacts from the reconstructed images. the experiments show that the proposed approach generates images with visual quality on par with state-of-the-art methods despite only using data from a short time interval. state-of-the-art results are achieved using an image denoising convolutional neural network (cnn) as the regularization function. the proposed regularized formulation and solvers have a unifying character because they can be applied also to reconstruct brightness from the second derivative. additionally, the formulation is attractive because it can be naturally combined with super-resolution, motion-segmentation and color demosaicing. code is available at https://github.com/tubrip/event_based_image_rec_inverse_problem",AB_0489
"background: recently, positive circumferential resection margin has been found to be an indicator of advanced disease with a high risk of distant recurrence rather than local recurrence. objective: the study aimed to analyze the prognostic impact of the circumferential resection margin on longterm oncological outcomes in patients with rectal cancer. design: this was a multicenter, propensity score-matched (2:1) analysis comparing the positive and negative circumferential resection margins. settings: the study was conducted at 5 high-volume centers in spain. patients: patients who underwent total mesorectal excision with curative intent for middle-low rectal cancer between 2006 and 2014 were included. main outcome measures: the main outcomes were local recurrence, distant recurrence, overall survival, and disease-free survival. results: the unmatched initial cohort consisted of 1599 patients, of whom 4.9% had a positive circumferential resection margin. after matching, 234 patients were included (156 with a negative circumferential margin and 78 with a positive circumferential margin). the median follow-up period was 52.5 (22.0-69.5) months. local recurrence was significantly higher in patients with a positive circumferential margin (33.3% vs 11.5%; p < 0.001). distant recurrence was similar in both groups (46.2% vs 42.3%; p = 0.651). there were no statistically significant differences in 5-year overall survival (48.6% vs 43.6%; p = 0.14). disease-free survival was lower in patients with a positive circumferential margin (36.1% vs 52.3%; p = 0.026). limitations: this study was limited by its retrospective design. the different neoadjuvant treatment options were not included in the propensity score. conclusions: the positive circumferential resection margin was associated with a higher local recurrence rate and worse disease-free survival in comparison with the negative circumferential resection margin. however, the positive circumferential resection margin was not a prognostic indicator of distant recurrence and overall survival. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/ b950.",AB_0489
