"surface solar irradiance varies on scales down to seconds, and detailed long-term observational datasets of this variable are rare but in high demand. here, we present an observational dataset of global, direct, and diffuse solar irradiance sampled at 1 hz as well as fully resolved variability until at least 0.1 hz over a period of 10 years from the baseline surface radiation network (bsrn) station at cabauw, the netherlands. the dataset is complemented with irradiance variability classifications, clear-sky irradiance and aerosol reanalysis, information about the solar position, observations of clouds and sky type, and wind measurements up to 200m above ground level. statistics of variability derived from all time series include approximately 185 000 detected events of both cloud enhancement and cloud shadows. additional observations from the cabauw measurement site are freely available from the open-data platform of the royal netherlands meteorological institute. this paper describes the observational site, quality control, classification algorithm with validation, and the processing method of complementary products. additionally, we discuss and showcase (potential) applications, including limitations due to sensor response time. these observations and derived statistics provide detailed information to aid research into how clouds and atmospheric composition influence solar irradiance variability as well as information to help validate models that are starting to resolve variability at higher fidelity. the main datasets are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7093164 (knap and mol, 2022) and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7462362 (mol et al., 2022); the reader is referred to the code and data availability section of this paper for the complete list.",AB_0550
"background: literature about sars-cov-2 widely discusses the effects of variations that have spread in the past 3 years. such information is dispersed in the texts of several research articles, hindering the possibility of practically integrating it with related datasets (e.g., millions of sars-cov-2 sequences available to the community). we aim to fill this gap, by mining literature abstracts to extract-for each variant/mutation-its related effects (in epidemiological, immunological, clinical, or viral kinetics terms) with labeled higher/lower levels in relation to the nonmutated virus. results: the proposed framework comprises (i) the provisioning of abstracts from a covid-19-related big data corpus (cord-19) and (ii) the identification of mutation/variant effects in abstracts using a gpt2-based prediction model. the above techniques enable the prediction of mutations/variants with their effects and levels in 2 distinct scenarios: (i) the batch annotation of the most relevant cord-19 abstracts and (ii) the on-demand annotation of any user-selected cord-19 abstract through the coveffect web application (http://gmql.eu/coveffect), which assists expert users with semiautomated data labeling. on the interface, users can inspect the predictions and correct them; user inputs can then extend the training dataset used by the prediction model. our prototype model was trained through a carefully designed process, using a minimal and highly diversified pool of samples. conclusions: the coveffect interface serves for the assisted annotation of abstracts, allowing the download of curated datasets for further use in data integration or analysis pipelines. the overall framework can be adapted to resolve similar unstructured-to-structured text translation tasks, which are typical of biomedical domains.",AB_0550
"introduction: despite the recent approval of several therapies in the adjuvant setting of melanoma, tumor relapse still occurs in a significant number of completely resected stage iii-iv patients. in this context, the use of cancer vaccines is still relevant and may increase the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. we previously demonstrated safety, immunogenicity and preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy in stage iii/iv resected melanoma patients subjected to a combination therapy based on peptide vaccination together with intermittent low-dose interferon-alpha 2b, with or without dacarbazine preconditioning (https:// www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search, identifier: 2008-008211-26). in this setting, we then focused on pre-treatment patient immune status to highlight possible factors associated with clinical outcome. methods: multiparametric flow cytometry was used to identify baseline immune profiles in patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells and correlation with the patient clinical outcome. receiver operating characteristic curve, kaplan-meier survival and principal component analyses were used to evaluate the predictive power of the identified markers. results: we identified 12 different circulating t and nk cell subsets with significant (p = 0.05) differential baseline levels in patients who later relapsed with respect to patients who remained free of disease. all 12 parameters showed a good prognostic accuracy (auc>0.7, p = 0.05) and 11 of them significantly predicted the relapse-free survival. remarkably, 3 classifiers also predicted the overall survival. focusing on immune cell subsets that can be analyzed through simple surface staining, three subsets were identified, namely regulatory t cells, cd56(dim)cd16- nk cells and central memory gd t cells. each subset showed an auc>0.8 and principal component analysis significantly grouped relapsing and non-relapsing patients (p=0.034). these three subsets were used to calculate a combination score that was able to perfectly distinguish relapsing and nonrelapsing patients (auc=1; p=0). noticeably, patients with a combined score =2 demonstrated a strong advantage in both relapse-free (p=0.002) and overall (p=0.011) survival as compared to patients with a score <2. discussion: predictive markers may be used to guide patient selection for personalized therapies and/ or improve follow- up strategies. this study provides preliminary evidence on the identification of peripheral blood immune biomarkers potentially capable of predicting the clinical response to combined vaccine-based adjuvant therapies in melanoma.",AB_0550
"objective: pulsed fields or waveforms with multi-frequency content have to be assessed with suitable methods. this paper deals with the uncertainty quantification associated to these methods.approach: among all possible approaches, the weighted peak method (wpm) is widely employed in standards and guidelines, therefore, in this paper, we consider its implementation both in time domain and frequency domain. for the uncertainty quantification the polynomial chaos expansion theory is used. by means of a sensitivity analysis, for several standard waveforms, the parameters with more influence on the exposure index are identified and their sensitivity indices are quantified. the output of the sensitivity analysis is used to set up a parametric analysis with the aim of evaluating the uncertainty propagation of the analyzed methods and, finally, also several measured waveforms generated by a welding gun are tested.main results: it is shown that the time domain implementation of the weighted peak method provides results in agreement with the basilar mechanisms of electromagnetic induction and electrostimulation. on the opposite, the wpm in frequency domain is found to be too sensitive to parameters that should not influence the exposure index because its weight function includes sharp variations of the phase centered on real zeros and poles. to overcome this issue, a new definition for the phase of the weight function in frequency domain is proposed.significance: it is shown that the time domain implementation of the wpm is the more accurate and precise. the standard wpm in frequency domain has some issues that can be avoided with the proposed modification of the phase definition of the weight function. finally, all the codes used in this paper are hosted on a github and can be freely accessed at https://github.com/giaccone/wpm_uncertainty.",AB_0550
"background: dexamethasone is a cornerstone of paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) treatment, although it can induce serious side-effects. our previous study suggests that children who suffer most from neurobehavioural side-effects might benefit from physiological hydrocortisone in addition to dexamethasone treatment. this study aimed to validate this finding.methods: our phase three, double-blind, randomised controlled trial with cross-over design included all patients (3-18 years) during medium-risk maintenance therapy in a national tertiary hospital between 17th may 2018 and 5th august 2020. a baseline measurement before and after a 5-day dexamethasone course was performed, whereafter 52 patients with clinically relevant neurobehavioural problems were randomised to receive an intervention during four subsequent dexamethasone courses. the intervention consisted of two courses hydrocortisone (physiological dose 10 mg/m2/d in circadian rhythm), followed by two courses placebo, or vice versa. neurobehavioural problems were assessed before and after each course using the parent-reported strengths and difficulties questionnaire (sdq) as primary end-point. secondary end-points were sleep problems, health-related quality of life (hrqol), hunger feeling, and parental stress, measured with questionnaires and actigraphy. a generalised mixed model was estimated to study the intervention effect.results: the median age was 5.5 years (range 3.0-18.8) and 61.5% were boys. the sdq filled in by 51 primary caregivers showed no difference between hydrocortisone and placebo in reducing dexamethasone-induced neurobehavioral problems (estimated effect-2.05 (95% confidence interval (ci)-6.00-1.90). also, no benefit from hydrocortisone compared to pla-cebo was found for reducing sleep problems, hunger, parental stress or improving hrqol.conclusions: hydrocortisone, when compared to placebo, had no additional effect in redu-cing clinically relevant dexamethasone-induced neurobehavioural problems. therefore, hy-drocortisone is not advised as standard of care for children with all who experience dexamethasone-induced neurobehavioural problems. trial registration: netherlandstrial register ntr6695/nl6507 (https://trialsearch.who.int/) and eudract 2017-002738-22 (https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/).(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc license ().",AB_0550
"we developed chrokit (the chromatin toolkit), an interactive web-based framework written in r that enables intuitive exploration, multidimensional analyses, and visualization of genomic data from chip-seq, dnase-seq or any other ngs experiment that reports the enrichment of aligned reads over genomic regions. this program takes preprocessed ngs data and performs operations on genomic regions of interest, including resetting their boundaries, their annotation based on proximity to genomic features, the association to gene ontologies, and signal enrichment calculations. genomic regions can be further refined or subsetted by user-defined logical operations and unsupervised classification algorithms. chrokit generates a full range of plots that are easily manipulated by point and click operations, thus allowing 'on the fly' re-analysis and fast exploration of the data. working sessions can be exported for reproducibility, accountability, and easy sharing within the bioinformatics community. chrokit is multiplatform and can be deployed on a server to enhance computational speed and provide simultaneous access by multiple users. chrokit is a fast and intuitive genomic analysis tool suited for a wide range of users due to its architecture and its user-friendly graphical interface. chrokit source code is available at https://github.com/ocroci/chrokit and the docker image at https://hub.docker.com/r/ocroci/chrokit.",AB_0550
"motivation: the transition from evaluating a single time point to examining the entire dynamic evolution of a system is possible only in the presence of the proper framework. the strong variability of dynamic evolution makes the definition of an explanatory procedure for data fitting and clustering challenging.results: we developed connector, a data-driven framework able to analyze and inspect longitudinal data in a straightforward and revealing way. when used to analyze tumor growth kinetics over time in 1599 patient-derived xenograft growth curves from ovarian and colorectal cancers, connector allowed the aggregation of time-series data through an unsupervised approach in informative clusters. we give a new perspective of mechanism interpretation, specifically, we define novel model aggregations and we identify unanticipated molecular associations with response to clinically approved therapies.availability and implementation: connector is freely available under gnu gpl license at https://qbioturin.github. io/connector and ",AB_0550
"background currently, several techniques for autologous fat graft (a-fg) preparation aimed at obtaining purified tissue exist. both mechanical digestions via centrifugation, filtration, and enzymatic digestion were considered the most effective with different impacts in terms of adult adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction cells (ad-svfs) amount that volume maintenance. objectives this article aimed to report the in vivo and in vitro results, represented by fat volume maintenance and ad-svfs amount, obtained by four different procedures of ad-svfs isolation and a-fg purification based on centrifugation, filtration, centrifugation with filtration, and enzymatic digestion. methods a prospective, case-control study was conducted. in total, 80 patients affected by face and breast soft tissue defects were treated with a-fg and divided into four groups: n=20 were treated with a-fg enhanced with ad-svfs obtained by enzymatic digestion (study group 1 [sg1]); n=20 were treated with a-fg enhanced with ad-svfs obtained by centrifugation with filtration (sg-2); n=20 were treated with a-fg enhanced with ad-svfs obtained by only filtration (sg-3); n=20 were treated with a-fg obtained by only centrifugation according to the coleman technique (control group [cg]). twelve months after the last a-fg session, the volume maintenance percentage was analyzed by magnetic resonance imaging (mri). isolated ad-svf populations were counted using a hemocytometer, and cell yield was reported as cell number/ml of fat. results starting with the same amount of fat analyzed (20 ml), 50,000 +/- 6956 ad-svfs/ml were obtained in sg-1; 30,250 +/- 5100 ad-svfs/ml in sg-2; 33.333 +/- 5650 ad-svfs/ml in sg-3, while 500 adsvfs/ml were obtained in cg. in patients treated with a-fg enhanced with ad-svfs obtained by automatic enzymatic digestion, a 63% +/- 6.2% maintenance of fat volume restoring after 1 year was observed compared with 52% +/- 4.6% using centrifugation with filtration, 39% +/- 4.4% using only centrifugation (coleman), and 60% +/- 5.0% using only filtration. conclusions in vitro ad-svfs cell analysis indicated that filtration was the most efficient system-between mechanical digestion procedures-thanks to the highest amount of cells obtained with fewer cell structure damage, producing in vivo, the most volume maintenance after 1 year. enzymatic digestion produced the best number of ad-svfs and the best fat volume maintenance. level of evidence iii this journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article. for a full description of these evidence-based medicine ratings, please refer to the table of contents or the online instructions to authors http://www.springer.com/00266.",AB_0550
"360 degrees videos provide an immersive experience, especially when watched in virtual reality (vr). yet, even though the video data is inherently three-dimensional, interfaces to access datasets of such videos in vr almost always use two-dimensional thumbnails shown in a grid on a flat or curved plane. we claim that using spherical and cube-shaped 3d thumbnails may provide a better user experience and be more effective at conveying the high-level subject matter of a video or when searching for a specific item in it. a comparative study against the most used existing representation, that is, 2d equirectangular projections, showed that the spherical 3d thumbnails did indeed provide the best user experience, whereas traditional 2d equirectangular projections still performed better for high-level classification tasks. yet, they were outperformed by spherical thumbnails when participants had to search for details within the videos. our results thus confirm a potential benefit of 3d thumbnail representations for 360-degree videos in vr, especially with respect to user experience and detailed content search and suggest a mixed interface design providing both options to the users. supplemental materials about the user study and used data are available at https://osf.io/5vk49/.",AB_0550
"background: understanding the mechanistic basis of air pollution toxicity is dependent on accurately characterizing both exposure and biological responses. untargeted metabolomics, an analysis of small-molecule metabolic phenotypes, may offer improved estimation of exposures and corresponding health responses to complex environmental mixtures such as air pollution. the field remains nascent, however, with questions concerning the coherence and generalizability of findings across studies, study designs and analytical platforms. objectives: we aimed to review the state of air pollution research from studies using untargeted high-resolution metabolomics (hrm), highlight the areas of concordance and dissimilarity in methodological approaches and reported findings, and discuss a path forward for future use of this analytical platform in air pollution research. methods: we conducted a state-of-the-science review to a) summarize recent research of air pollution studies using untargeted metabolomics and b) identify gaps in the peer-reviewed literature and opportunities for addressing these gaps in future designs. we screened articles published within pubmed and web of science between 1 january 2005 and 31 march 2022. two reviewers independently screened 2,065 abstracts, with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. results: we identified 47 articles that applied untargeted metabolomics on serum, plasma, whole blood, urine, saliva, or other biospecimens to investigate the impact of air pollution exposures on the human metabolome. eight hundred sixteen unique features confirmed with level-1 or -2 evidence were reported to be associated with at least one or more air pollutants. hypoxanthine, histidine, serine, aspartate, and glutamate were among the 35 metabolites consistently exhibiting associations with multiple air pollutants in at least 5 independent studies. oxidative stress and inflammation-related pathways-including glycerophospholipid metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, methionine and cysteine metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism-were the most commonly perturbed pathways reported in >70% of studies. more than 80% of the reported features were not chemically annotated, limiting the interpretability and generalizability of the findings. conclusions: numerous investigations have demonstrated the feasibility of using untargeted metabolomics as a platform linking exposure to internal dose and biological response. our review of the 47 existing untargeted hrm-air pollution studies points to an underlying coherence and consistency across a range of sample analytical quantitation methods, extraction algorithms, and statistical modeling approaches. future directions should focus on validation of these findings via hypothesis-driven protocols and technical advances in metabolic annotation and quantification. https://doi.org/",AB_0550
