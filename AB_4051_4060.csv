"statistical postprocessing of medium-range weather forecasts is an important component of modern forecasting systems. since the beginning of modern data science, numerous new postprocessing methods have been proposed, complementing an already very diverse field. however, one of the questions that frequently arises when considering different methods in the framework of implementing operational postprocessing is the relative performance of the methods for a given specific task. it is particularly challenging to find or construct a common comprehensive dataset that can be used to perform such comparisons. here, we introduce the first version of euppbench (eumetnet postprocessing benchmark), a dataset of time-aligned forecasts and observations, with the aim to facilitate and standardize this process. this dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/eupp-benchmark/climetlab-eumetnet-postprocessing-benchmark (31 december 2022) and on zenodo (, and , ). we provide examples showing how to download and use the data, we propose a set of evaluation methods, and we perform a first benchmark of several methods for the correction of 2 m temperature forecasts.",AB_0406
"the human interactome is composed of around half a million interactions according to recent estimations and it is only for a small fraction of those that three-dimensional structural information is available. indeed, the structural coverage of the human interactome is very low and given the complexity and timeconsuming requirements of solving protein structures this problem will remain for the foreseeable future. structural models, or predictions, of protein complexes can provide valuable information when the experimentally determined 3d structures are not available. here we present cm2d3, a relational database containing structural models of the whole human interactome derived both from comparative modeling and data-driven docking. starting from a consensus interactome derived from integrating several interactomics databases, a strategy was devised to derive structural models by computational means. currently, cm2d3 includes 33338 structural models of which 5121 derived from comparative modeling and the remaining from docking. of the latter, the structures of 14554 complexes were derived from monomers modeled by m4t while the rest were modeled with structures as predicted by alphafold2. lastly, cm2d3 complements existing resources by focusing on models derived from both free-docking, as opposed to template-based docking, and hence expanding the available structural information on protein complexes to the scientific community. database url: http://www.bioinsilico.org/cm2d3 (c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0406
"the plantain agro-industry generates different residues in the harvest and post-harvest stages. therefore, new processes for its valorization are required. the aim of this research was to propose a general methodological framework for the design and analysis of multi -input biorefineries for the valorization of residues with a high content of lignocellulosic and starchy materials. this approach was based on the independent processing of the starchy and lignocellulosic materials in the first steps of the biorefinery and relies on process simulation and hierarchic process design procedures. a case study for the design of a multi-input biorefinery for the valorization of residues from the plantain agro-in-dustry was performed by applying the framework proposed. the biorefinery was simu-lated using superpro designer software. the results obtained suggest that the best alternative for the valorization of plantain residues under colombian conditions corre-sponded to the following distribution of key residues: 100% leaf sheaths processed into the natural fiber production section, and 25% peels and 25% rachis processed into the starch extraction and liquefaction section; with this distribution, an npv of $21,348,000 can be achieved. this work shows that waste from the plantain agro-industry exhibits high po-tential as a feedstock for the production of value-added products.& copy; 2023 the authors. published by elsevier ltd on behalf of institution of chemical engineers. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://creati-vecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0406
"the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) pandemic emerged in 2019 and still requiring treatments with fast clinical translatability. frequent occurrence of mutations in spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 led the consideration of an alternative therapeutic target to combat the ongoing pandemic. the main protease (m-pro) is such an attractive drug target due to its importance in maturating several polyproteins during the replication process. in the present study, we used a classification structure-activity relationship (csar) model to find substructures that leads to to anti-m-pro activities among 758 non-redundant compounds. a set of 12 fingerprints were used to describe m-pro inhibitors, and the random forest approach was used to build prediction models from 100 distinct data splits. the data set's modelability (modi index) was found to be robust, with a value of 0.79 above the 0.65 threshold. the accuracy (89%), sensitivity (89%), specificity (73%), and matthews correlation coefficient (79%) used to calculate the prediction performance, was also found to be statistically robust. an extensive analysis of the top significant descriptors unveiled the significance of methyl side chains, aromatic ring and halogen groups for m-pro inhibition. finally, the predictive model is made publicly accessible as a web-app named m(pro)pred in order to allow users to predict the bioactivity of compounds against sars-cov-2 m-pro. later, cmnpd, a marine compound database was screened by our app to predict bioactivity of all the compounds and results revealed significant correlation with their binding affinity to m-pro. molecular dynamics (md) simulation and molecular mechanics/poisson boltzmann surface area (mm/pbsa) analysis showed improved properties of the complexes. thus, the knowledge and web-app shown herein can be used to develop more effective and specific inhibitors against the sars-cov-2 m-pro. the web-app can be accessed from https://share.streamlit.io/nadimfrds/mpropred/mpropred_app.py.",AB_0406
"aims/hypothesis type 2 diabetes is associated with increased risk of cognitive decline although the pathogenic basis for this remains obscure. deciphering diabetes-linked molecular mechanisms in cells of the cerebral cortex could uncover novel therapeutic targets. methods single-cell transcriptomic sequencing (scrna-seq) was conducted on the cerebral cortex in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes (db/db mice) and in non-diabetic control mice in order to identify gene expression changes in distinct cell subpopulations and alterations in cell type composition. immunohistochemistry and metabolic assessment were used to validate the findings from scrna-seq and to investigate whether these cell-specific dysfunctions impact the neurovascular unit (nvu). furthermore, the behavioural and cognitive alterations related to these dysfunctions in db/db mice were assessed via morris water maze and novel object discrimination tests. finally, results were validated in post-mortem sections and protein isolates from individuals with type 2 diabetes. results compared with non-diabetic control mice, the db/db mice demonstrated disrupted brain function as revealed by losses in episodic and spatial memory and this occurred concomitantly with dysfunctional nvu, neuronal circuitry and cerebral atrophy. scrna-seq of db/db mouse cerebral cortex revealed cell population changes in neurons, glia and microglia linked to functional regulatory disruption including neuronal maturation and altered metabolism. these changes were validated through immunohistochemistry and protein expression analysis not just in the db/db mouse cerebral cortex but also in postmortem sections and protein isolates from individuals with type 2 diabetes (74.3 +/- 5.5 years) compared with non-diabetic control individuals (87.0 +/- 8.5 years). furthermore, metabolic and synaptic gene disruptions were evident in cortical nvu cell populations and associated with a decrease in vascular density. conclusions/interpretation taken together, our data reveal disruption in the cellular and molecular architecture of the cerebral cortex induced by diabetes, which can explain, at least in part, the basis for progressive cognitive decline in individuals with type 2 diabetes. data availability the single-cell sequencing data that supports this study are available at geo accession gse217665 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse217665).",AB_0406
"-background: glioblastoma (gbm) is the most com-mon brain tumor in the united states, with an annual incidence rate of 3.21 per 100,000. it is the most aggressive type of diffuse glioma and has a median survival of months after treatment. this study aims to assess the accuracy different novel deep learning models trained on a set simple clinical, demographic, and surgical variables assist in clinical practice, even in areas with constrained health care infrastructure. -methods: our study included 37,095 patients with gbm from the seer (surveillance epidemiology and end results) database. all predictors were based on demographic, clinicopathologic, and treatment information of the cases. our outcomes of interest were months of survival and vital status. concordance index (c-index) and integrated brier scores (ibs) were used to evaluate the performance of the models. -results: the patient characteristics and the statistical analyses were consistent with the epidemiologic litera-ture. the models c-index and ibs ranged from 0.6743 0.6918 and from 0.0934 to 0.1034, respectively. probabilistic matrix factorization (0.6918), multitask logistic regression (0.6916), and logistic hazard (0.6916) had the highest c-in-dex scores. the models with the lowest ibs were the probabilistic matrix factorization (0.0934), multitask logistic regression (0.0935), and logistic hazard (0.0936). these models had an accuracy (1-ibs) of 90.66%; 90.65%, and 90.64%, respectively. the deep learning algorithms were deployed on an interactive web-based tool for practical use available via https://glioblastoma-survanalysis. herokuapp.com/.- conclusions: novel deep learning algorithms can better predict gbm prognosis than do baseline methods and can lead to more personalized patient care regardless of extensive electronic health record availability.",AB_0406
"motivation: codon usage preference patterns have been associated with modulation of translation efficiency, protein folding, and mrna decay. however, new studies support that codon pair usage has also a remarkable effect at the gene expression level. here, we expand the concept of cai to answer if codon pair usage patterns can be understood in terms of codon usage bias, or if they offer new information regarding coding translation efficiency. results: through the implementation of a weighting strategy to consider the dicodon contributions, we observe that the dicodon-based measure has greater correlations with gene expression level than cai. interestingly, we have noted that dicodons associated with a low value of adaptiveness are related to dicodons which mediate strong translational inhibition in yeast. we have also noticed that some codon-pairs have a smaller dicodon contribution than estimated by the product of the respective codon contributions. availability and implementation: scripts, implemented in python, are freely available for download at https://zenodo.org/record/7738276#. zbidbtlmidu.",AB_0406
"motivation: spatial transcriptomics (st) can reveal the existence and extent of spatial variation of gene expression in complex tissues. such analyses could help identify spatially localized processes underlying a tissue's function. existing tools to detect spatially variable genes assume a constant noise variance across spatial locations. this assumption might miss important biological signals when the variance can change across locations. results: in this article, we propose novatest, a framework to identify genes with location-dependent noise variance in st data. novatest models gene expression as a function of spatial location and allows the noise to vary spatially. novatest then statistically compares this model to one with constant noise and detects genes showing significant spatial noise variation. we refer to these genes as noisy genes. in tumor samples, the noisy genes detected by novatest are largely independent of the spatially variable genes detected by existing tools that assume constant noise, and provide important biological insights into tumor microenvironments. availability and implementation: an implementation of the novatest framework in python along with instructions for running the pipeline is available at https://github.com/abidabrar-bracu/novatest.",AB_0406
"motivation: while the search for associations between genetic markers and complex traits has led to the discovery of tens of thousands of trait-related genetic variants, the vast majority of these only explain a small fraction of the observed phenotypic variation. one possible strategy to overcome this while leveraging biological prior is to aggregate the effects of several genetic markers and to test entire genes, pathways or (sub)networks of genes for association to a phenotype. the latter, network-based genome-wide association studies, in particular suffer from a vast search space and an inherent multiple testing problem. as a consequence, current approaches are either based on greedy feature selection, thereby risking that they miss relevant associations, or neglect doing a multiple testing correction, which can lead to an abundance of false positive findings. results: to address the shortcomings of current approaches of network-based genome-wide association studies, we propose networkgwas, a computationally efficient and statistically sound approach to network-based genome-wide association studies using mixed models and neighborhood aggregation. it allows for population structure correction and for well-calibrated p-values, which are obtained through circular and degree-preserving network permutations. networkgwas successfully detects known associations on diverse synthetic phenotypes, as well as known and novel genes in phenotypes from saccharomyces cerevisiae and homo sapiens. it thereby enables the systematic combination of gene-based genome-wide association studies with biological network information. availability and implementation: https://github.com/borgwardtlab/networkgwas.git.",AB_0406
