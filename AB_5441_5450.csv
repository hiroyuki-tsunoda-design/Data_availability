"medical imaging represents the primary tool for investigating and monitoring several diseases, including cancer. the advances in quantitative image analysis have developed towards the extraction of biomarkers able to support clinical decisions. to produce robust results, multi-center studies are often set up. however, the imaging information must be denoised from confounding factors-known as batch-effect-like scanner-specific and center-specific influences. moreover, in non-solid cancers, like lymphomas, effective biomarkers require an imaging-based representation of the disease that accounts for its multi-site spreading over the patient's body. in this work, we address the dual-factor deconfusion problem and we propose a deconfusion algorithm to harmonize the imaging information of patients affected by hodgkin lymphoma in a multi-center setting. we show that the proposed model successfully denoises data from domain-specific variability (p-value < 0.001) while it coherently preserves the spatial relationship between imaging descriptions of peer lesions (p-value = 0), which is a strong prognostic biomarker for tumor heterogeneity assessment. this harmonization step allows to significantly improve the performance in prognostic models with respect to state-of-the-art methods, enabling building exhaustive patient representations and delivering more accurate analyses (p-values < 0.001 in training, p-values < 0.05 in testing). this work lays the groundwork for performing large-scale and reproducible analyses on multi-center data that are urgently needed to convey the translation of imaging-based biomarkers into the clinical practice as effective prognostic tools. the code is available on github at this https://github.com/laracavinato/dual-adae.",AB_0545
"objective: design and assessment of new therapies for type 1 diabetes (t1d) management can be greatly facilitated by in silico simulations. the replaybg simulation methodology here proposed allows replaying the scenario behind data already collected by simulating the glucose concentration obtained in response to alternative insulin/carbohydrate therapies and evaluate their efficacy leveraging the concept of digital twin. methods: replaybg is based on two steps. first, a personalized model of glucose-insulin dynamics is identified using insulin, carbohydrate, and continuous glucose monitoring (cgm) data. then, this model is used to simulate the glucose concentration that would have been obtained by replaying the same portion of data using a different therapy. the validity of the methodology was evaluated on 100 virtual subjects using the uva/padova t1d simulator (t1ds). in particular, the glucose concentration traces simulated by replaybg are compared with those provided by t1ds in five different scenarios of insulin and carbohydrate treatment modifications. furthermore, we compared replaybg with a state-of-the-art methodology for the scope. finally, two case studies using real data are also presented. results: replaybg simulates with high accuracy the effect of the considered insulin and carbohydrate treatment alterations, performing significantly better than state-of-art method in almost all considered situations. conclusion: replaybg proved to be a reliable and robust tool to retrospectively explore the effect of new treatments for t1d on the glucose dynamics. it is freely available as open source software at https://github.com/gcappon/replay-bg.",AB_0545
"background: despite the widely accepted association between excessive straining and perineal descent, the clinical significance of perineal descent in patients with obstructed defecation syndrome is still unclear. objective: this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of pathological perineal descent in patients with obstructed defecation syndrome and the impact of perineal descent on symptoms severity. design: this was a prospective multicenter uncontrolled study. settings: the study involved 3 hospital pelvic-care centers and was conducted from january 2018 to january 2022. patients: the study included 141 consecutive adult patients with an obstructed defecation syndrome score of 9 or more and no evidence of organic gi pathology. all the patients underwent dynamic pelvic mri and, in case of suspected paradoxical puborectalis contraction, anal manometry. main outcome measures: main outcome measures were the prevalence of excessive perineal descent and the correlation between perineal descent and obstructed defecation syndrome score. results: one hundred twenty-eight patients (90.7%) completed magnetic resonance examination and were included in the analysis. of these, 18 patients (14.1%) had a physiological perineal descent and 110 (85.9%) had an excessive perineal descent. excessive perineal descent was found in 46.1% of patients (12/26) with mri signs of paradoxical puborectalis contraction and in 96% of patients (98/102) with normal puborectalis relaxation. in this latter group of patients, a good correlation between obstructed defecation syndrome score and maximum perineal descent during straining was found (spearman r test: 0.68; p < 0.0001). limitations: the study was limited by the small sample size and by the strong selection of the study population. conclusions: excessive perineal descent is a common finding in patients with obstructed defecation syndrome and high symptoms score, occurring almost consistently in patients without paradoxical puborectalis contraction. in these patients, the maximum perineal descent seems to be well correlated with symptoms severity. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c135.",AB_0545
"disprot (url: https://disprot.org) is the gold standard database for intrinsically disordered proteins and regions, providing valuable information about their functions. the latest version of disprot brings significant advancements, including a broader representation of functions and an enhanced curation process. these improvements aim to increase both the quality of annotations and their coverage at the sequence level. higher coverage has been achieved by adopting additional evidence codes. quality of annotations has been improved by systematically applying minimum information about disorder experiments (miade) principles and reporting all the details of the experimental setup that could potentially influence the structural state of a protein. the disprot database now includes new thematic datasets and has expanded the adoption of gene ontology terms, resulting in an extensive functional repertoire which is automatically propagated to uniprotkb. finally, we show that disprot's curated annotations strongly correlate with disorder predictions inferred from alphafold2 plddt (predicted local distance difference test) confidence scores. this comparison highlights the utility of disprot in explaining apparent uncertainty of certain well-defined predicted structures, which often correspond to folding-upon-binding fragments. overall, disprot serves as a comprehensive resource, combining experimental evidence of disorder information to enhance our understanding of intrinsically disordered proteins and their functional implications. graphical abstract",AB_0545
"to compare the performance of humans, gpt-4.0 and gpt-3.5 in answering multiple-choice questions from the american academy of ophthalmology (aao) basic and clinical science course (bcsc) self-assessment program, available at https://www.aao.org/education/self-assessments. in june 2023, text-based multiple-choice questions were submitted to gpt-4.0 and gpt-3.5. the aao provides the percentage of humans who selected the correct answer, which was analyzed for comparison. all questions were classified by 10 subspecialties and 3 practice areas (diagnostics/clinics, medical treatment, surgery). out of 1023 questions, gpt-4.0 achieved the best score (82.4%), followed by humans (75.7%) and gpt-3.5 (65.9%), with significant difference in accuracy rates (always p < 0.0001). both gpt-4.0 and gpt-3.5 showed the worst results in surgery-related questions (74.6% and 57.0% respectively). for difficult questions (answered incorrectly by > 50% of humans), both gpt models favorably compared to humans, without reaching significancy. the word count for answers provided by gpt-4.0 was significantly lower than those produced by gpt-3.5 (160 +/- 56 and 206 +/- 77 respectively, p < 0.0001); however, incorrect responses were longer (p < 0.02). gpt-4.0 represented a substantial improvement over gpt-3.5, achieving better performance than humans in an aao bcsc self-assessment test. however, chatgpt is still limited by inconsistency across different practice areas, especially when it comes to surgery.",AB_0545
"in this paper, we propose frankenmask, a novel framework that allows swapping and rearranging face parts in semantic masks for automatic editing of shape-related facial attributes. this is a novel yet challenging task as substituting face parts in a semantic mask requires to account for possible spatial misalignment and the adaptation of surrounding regions. we obtain such a feature by combining a transformer encoder to learn the spatial relationships of facial parts, with an encoder-decoder architecture, which reconstructs a complete mask from the composition of local parts. reconstruction and attribute classification results demonstrate the effective synthesis of facial images, while showing the generation of accurate and plausible facial attributes. code is available at https://github.com/tfonta/frankenmask_semantic.",AB_0545
"purposebleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin combination chemotherapy (bep) improves the survival of patients with testicular cancer, but is associated with potentially life-threatening toxicities like pneumonitis and thromboembolic events. this study explored the effects of physical exercise in patients with testicular cancer during or after bep-chemotherapy on pulmonary and vascular endothelial toxicity.methodsin this post hoc analysis of a multicenter randomized clinical trial (nct01642680), patients with metastatic testicular cancer scheduled to receive bep-chemotherapy were randomized to a 24-week exercise intervention, initiated during (group a) or after bep-chemotherapy (group b). endpoints were pulmonary function (forced vital capacity (fvc), forced expiratory volume in one second (fev1), lung transfer-coefficient and transfer factor for carbon monoxide (kco, dlco) and markers of vascular endothelial dysfunction (von willebrand factor (vwf) and factor viii).resultsthirty patients were included. post-chemotherapy, patients declined less in fvc, fev1 and dlco in group a compared to group b. post-chemotherapy, vwf and factor viii were significantly lower in group a compared to group b. after completion of exercise, started either during bep-chemotherapy or thereafter, no between-group differences were found. at 1-year post-intervention, significant between-group differences were found in favour of group a in dlco and kco.conclusionspatients who exercised during bep-chemotherapy better preserved fvc, fev1 and dlco, measured directly post-chemotherapy and 1-year post-intervention (dlco, kco). this coincided with less increase in vwf and factor viii measured directly post-chemotherapy. these data support a beneficial role of a physical exercise intervention during bep-chemotherapy on pulmonary and vascular damage in patients with testicular cancer.trial registryoptimal timing of physical activity in cancer treatment (act) registry url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct01642680. trial registration number: nct01642680.",AB_0545
"the climatic response of mountain permafrost and glaciers located in high-elevation mountain areas has major implications for the stability of mountain slopes and related geomorphological hazards, water storage and supply, and preservation of palaeoclimatic archives. despite a good knowledge of physical processes that govern the climatic response of mountain permafrost and glaciers, there is a lack of observational datasets from summit areas. this represents a crucial gap in knowledge and a serious limit for model-based projections of future behaviour of permafrost and glaciers. a new observational dataset is available for the summit area of mt ortles, which is the highest summit of south tyrol, italy. this paper presents a series of air, englacial, soil surface and rock wall temperatures collected between 2010 and 2016. details are provided regarding instrument types and characteristics, field methods, and data quality control and assessment. the obtained data series are available through an open data repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8330289, carturan et al., 2023). in the observed period, the mean annual air temperature at 3830 m a.s.l. was between -7.8 and -8.6 c-degrees. the most shallow layers of snow and firn (down to a depth of about 10 m) froze during winter. however, melt water percolation restored isothermal conditions during the ablation season, and the entire firn layer was found at the melting pressure point. glacier ice is cold, but only from about 30 m depth. englacial temperature decreases with depth, reaching a minimum of almost -3 c-degrees close to the bedrock, at 75 m depth. a small glacier located at 3470 m a.s.l., close to the summit of mt ortles, was also found in cold conditions down to a depth of 9.5 m. the mean annual ground surface temperature was negative for all but one monitored sites, indicating cold ground conditions and the existence of permafrost in nearly all debris-mantled slopes of the summit. similarly, the mean annual rock wall temperature was negative at most monitored sites, except the lowest one at 3030 m a.s.l. this suggests that the rock faces of the summit are affected by permafrost at all exposures.",AB_0545
"over a hundred experiments were conducted between 1998 and 2022 in the mediterranean sea using surface lagrangian drifters at coastal and offshore levels. raw data were initially unified and pre-processed manually by eliminating spikes and wrong positions or date/time information. the integrity of the received data packages was checked, and incomplete ones were discarded. deployment information was retrieved for each drifter and integrated into the postgresql database, realized and maintained by the national institute of oceanography and applied geophysics (ogs) in trieste (italy). this database also collects a variety of metadata about the drifter model, project, owner, and operator. subsequently, data were processed using standard procedures of editing and quality control developed for the ogs drifter dataset to remove spikes generated by malfunctioning of the sensors and to obtain files with common characteristics. drifter data and plots of each track were also visually checked to remove any point not identified by the automatic procedure and which were clearly erroneous. drifter trajectories were split into two or more segments that are considered different deployments in the case of specific drifter behaviour. data were interpolated at defined time intervals providing a dataset of 158 trajectories, available from the public open-access repository of sea scientific open data edition (seanoe) at 10.17882/90537 (ribotti et al., 2022), in two versions (one compliant with the copernicus format and the other one usable with panoply netcdf viewer), and of seadatanet at https://cdi.seadatanet.org/search/welcome.php?query=2610&query_code={9f00df80-1881-42dd-9df1-b9bd0282f2b0} (last access: 5 october 2023).",AB_0545
"a facile, reproducible, and scalable wet precipitation method was optimized to synthetise cu2o nanocubes with tuneable morphology and photocatalytic properties. the synthesis process was standardized by controlling the flow rate of addition of the reducing agent. this allowed to control the cu2o crystallites size, which decreased from 60 nm to 30 nm by increasing the l-ascorbic acid flow rate, while maintaining a high yield (ranging from 87% to 97%) and reproducibility, as confirmed by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. moreover, the role of the synthesis conditions on the cu2o nanocubes specific surface area and electrochemical surface area (ecsa) were investigated and correlated to their photo-electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of water and co2 under ambient conditions, on electrodes made by air brushing. decreasing of the cu2o crystallites size enhanced the photo-electrocatalytic activity most probably due to a superior surface area, ecsa and an optimum valence and conduction band positions, which improves the charge transfer properties of the photocatalyst. the here proposed methodology and outcomes are very promising for the scale-up of the precipitation synthesis, not only of cu2o but also of other nanostructured metal oxides to be exploited as photo-catalysts for environmental and energy applications.(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd on behalf of institution of chemical engineers. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://creati-vecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0545
