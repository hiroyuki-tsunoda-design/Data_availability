"backgroundendotoxin adsorption is a promising but controversial therapy in severe, refractory septic shock and conflicting results exist on the effective capacity of available devices to reduce circulating endotoxin and inflammatory cytokine levels.methodsmultiarm, randomized, controlled trial in two swiss intensive care units, with a 1:1:1 randomization of patients suffering severe, refractory septic shock with high levels of endotoxemia, defined as an endotoxin activity >= 0.6, a vasopressor dependency index >= 3, volume resuscitation of at least 30 ml/kg/24 h and at least single organ failure, to a haemoadsorption (toraymyxin), an enhanced adsorption haemofiltration (oxiris) or a control intervention. primary endpoint was the difference in endotoxin activity at 72-h post-intervention to baseline. in addition, inflammatory cytokine, vasopressor dependency index and sofa-score dynamics over the initial 72 h were assessed inter alia.resultsin the 30, out of 437 screened, randomized patients (10 standard of care, 10 oxiris, 10 toraymyxin), endotoxin reduction at 72-h post-intervention-start did not differ among interventions (standard of care: 12 [1-42]%, oxiris: 21 [10-51]%, toraymyxin: 23 [10-36]%, p = 0.82). furthermore, no difference between groups could be observed neither for reduction of inflammatory cytokine levels (p = 0.58), nor for vasopressor weaning (p = 0.95) or reversal of organ injury (p = 0.22).conclusionsin a highly endotoxemic, severe, refractory septic shock population neither the toraymyxin adsorber nor the oxiris membrane could show a reduction in circulating endotoxin or cytokine levels over standard of care.trial registration clinicaltrials.gov. nct01948778. registered august 30, 2013. https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/nct01948778conclusionsin a highly endotoxemic, severe, refractory septic shock population neither the toraymyxin adsorber nor the oxiris membrane could show a reduction in circulating endotoxin or cytokine levels over standard of care.trial registration clinicaltrials.gov. nct01948778. registered august 30, 2013. https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/nct01948778",AB_0505
"background: low-complexity data analysis is the area that addresses the search and quantification of regions in sequences of elements that contain low-complexity or repetitive elements. for example, these can be tandem repeats, inverted repeats, homopolymer tails, gc-biased regions, similar genes, and hairpins, among many others. identifying these regions is crucial because of their association with regulatory and structural characteristics. moreover, their identification provides positional and quantity information where standard assembly methodologies face significant difficulties because of substantial higher depth coverage (mountains), ambiguous read mapping, or where sequencing or reconstruction defects may occur. however, the capability to distinguish low-complexity regions (lcrs) in genomic and proteomic sequences is a challenge that depends on the model's ability to find them automatically. low-complexity patterns can be implicit through specific or combined sources, such as algorithmic or probabilistic, and recurring to different spatial distances-namely, local, medium, or distant associations. findings: this article addresses the challenge of automatically modeling and distinguishing lcrs, providing a new method and tool (alcor) for efficient and accurate segmentation and visualization of these regions in genomic and proteomic sequences. the method enables the use of models with different memories, providing the ability to distinguish local from distant low-complexity patterns. the method is reference and alignment free, providing additional methodologies for testing, including a highly flexible simulation method for generating biological sequences (dna or protein) with different complexity levels, sequence masking, and a visualization tool for automatic computation of the lcr maps into an ideogram style. we provide illustrative demonstrations using synthetic, nearly synthetic, and natural sequences showing the high efficiency and accuracy of alcor. as large-scale results, we use alcor to unprecedentedly provide a whole-chromosome low-complexity map of a recent complete human genome and the haplotype-resolved chromosome pairs of a heterozygous diploid african cassava cultivar. conclusions: the alcor method provides the ability of fast sequence characterization through data complexity analysis, ideally for scenarios entangling the presence of new or unknown sequences. alcor is implemented in c language using multithreading to increase the computational speed, is flexible for multiple applications, and does not contain external dependencies. the tool accepts any sequence in fasta format. the source code is freely provided at https://github.com/cobilab/alcor",AB_0505
"objectivescognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) is the most promising treatment for gambling disorder (gd) but only 21% of those with problematic gambling seek treatment. cbt over the internet might be one way to reach a larger population. the aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of internet-delivered cbt with therapist guidance compared to an active control treatment.methodsusing a single-blinded design, 71 treatment-seeking gamblers (18-75 years) diagnosed with gd were randomized to 8 weeks of internet-delivered cbt guided by telephone support, or 8 weeks of internet-delivered motivational enhancement paired with motivational interviewing via telephone (imi). the primary outcome was gambling symptoms measured at a first face-to-face assessment, baseline (treatment start), every 2 weeks, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. gambling expenditures, time spent gambling, depression, anxiety, cognitive distortions, and quality of life were assessed as secondary outcomes. analysis was performed on the full analysis sample (n = 60), with intention-to-treat sensitivity analyses (n = 69).resultsin the cbt group, 80% stayed in treatment until the final week, compared to 67% in imi. post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up, no differences were found between cbt and imi for any outcome measure. an exploratory analysis of the total sample (n = 60) showed a significant effect of time during treatment on gambling symptoms (d, [95% ci] 0.52, [-1.15, 2.02]) and all secondary outcomes except the gambling diary (depression (0.89, [-1.07-2.65]); anxiety (0.69, [-1.20-2.38])); cognitive distortions (0.84, [-0.73-2.29]); quality of life (0.60, [-0.61-1.70])). post-treatment, there were no clinical gambling symptoms in either group. some deterioration was seen between post-treatment and 6-month follow-up on gambling symptoms (0.42, [-1.74-2.43]), depression (0.59, [-0.82-1.86]), and anxiety (0.30, [-0.99-1.48]). additionally, it was observed that the largest reduction in gambling symptoms was between the first assessment and baseline.conclusionboth treatments offered in this study were effective at reducing gambling symptoms. it is also possible that the process of change started before treatment, which gives promise to low-intensity interventions for gd. additional research is needed as this approach could be both cost-effective and has the potential to reach more patients in need of treatment than is currently possible.clinical trial registration:https://www.isrctn.com/, identifier isrctn38692394.",AB_0505
"garment modeling is an essential task of the global apparel industry and a core part of digital human modeling. realistic representation of garments with valid sewing patterns is key to their accurate digital simulation and eventual fabrication. however, little-to-no computational tools provide support for bridging the gap between high-level construction goals and low-level editing of pattern geometry, e.g., combining or switching garment elements, semantic editing, or design exploration that maintains the validity of a sewing pattern. we suggest the first dsl for garment modeling garmentcode - that applies principles of object-oriented programming to garment construction and allows designing sewing patterns in a hierarchical, component-oriented manner. the programming-based paradigm naturally provides unique advantages of component abstraction, algorithmic manipulation, and free-form design parametrization. we additionally support the construction process by automating typical low-level tasks like placing a dart at a desired location. in our prototype garment configurator, users can manipulate meaningful design parameters and body measurements, while the construction of pattern geometry is handled by garment programs implemented with garmentcode. our configurator enables the free exploration of rich design spaces and the creation of garments using interchangeable, parameterized components. we showcase our approach by producing a variety of garment designs and retargeting them to different body shapes using our configurator. the library and garment configurator are available at https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/garmentcode.",AB_0505
"introduction housing and the ageing population are issues that pose challenges for social, health and economic policies. therefore, there is a need for more knowledge on how to design housing and public infrastructure to improve the social engagement and well-being of older adults who age in place. this project aims to provide an overview of the existing literature on design features that support socially sustainable living environments for older adults. methods and analysis a systematic scoping methodology was used to identify and summarise the findings. four databases were searched (cinahl (cumulative index to nursing and allied health literature), scopus, medline and embase) to identify the articles. articles were included if published in english in the last 15 years (eg, from january 2008 to june 2023) without restricting the study location or country. articles were included if they were based on empirical qualitative, quantitative and mixed-method data. the results of the review will be discussed with a panel of 15 stakeholders (n=15) from canada, sweden and the netherlands (five per country). the interdisciplinary stakeholders will have expertise in housing, architecture, engineering and social and health services. the consultations will provide content expertise to the literature findings and an opportunity to build evidence-based solutions that support the design of socially sustainable living environments for older persons. ethics and dissemination ethical clearance for this project has been granted by the swedish ethical review authority for dalarna university (dnr 2023-01543-01) and the natural sciences and engineering sciences (nes) ethics committee at the university of twente in the netherlands (dnr 230407) has approved this project. stakeholders will be asked to provide signed consent to participate in the study. the results of this project will be disseminated through web seminars, community advisory groups, peer-reviewed journals and policy documents to support the development of housing and public health policy. trial registration number osf, https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/pr2nc.",AB_0505
"background: clinical and biochemical vitamin b12 (b12) deficiency is lower than anticipated in vegetarians. extraileal absorption, such as from the colon, as well as reduced daily excretion, may be adaptive mechanisms to maintain b12 homeostasis with marginal intakes.objective: to measure the absorption of b12 from the small and large intestine, and its daily rate of excretion from the body, using a [13c]-cyanoco-balamin tracer.methods: oral b12 bioavailability was measured over 12 h after administration of [13c]-cyanocobalamin tracer (2.5 mu g) in normal participants. the colonic b12 bioavailability was evaluated by direct instillation of [13c]-cyanocobalamin (5 mu g) into the ascending colon. bioavailability was calculated from 2-compartmental modeling of the tracer appearance in plasma. the excretion rate of b12 was measured from [13c]-cyanocobalamin elimination from the body over 4 wk after oral dosing (5 mu g).results: the oral b12 bioavailability (n = 11) was 63% +/- 10% measured over 12 h. a late absorption peak, accounting for 12% of the absorption, was observed after an average lag time of 8.7 h from dosing. the colonic b12 bioavailability (n = 10) was 7% +/- 5% over 4 h. the daily b12 excretion rate (n = 4) was 0.7 +/- 0.2 mu g/d. the minimum daily requirement of b12 in these participants was derived at 1 mu g /d.conclusions: b12 is absorbed in the human colon. this observation confirms the potential contribution of the colon in daily b12 nutriture, and along with a possible lower requirement, could explain the absence of clinical deficiency in populations with marginal b12 intakes.trial registration number: this study was registered in clinical trials registry of india (ctri) with the registration number ctri/2018/04/012957, available from https://ctri.nic.in/clinicaltrials/showallp.php?mid1=49319&enchid=&username=029108.",AB_0505
"the widely used milky way dust-reddening map, the schlegel-finkbeiner-davis (sfd) map, was found to contain extragalactic large-scale structure (lss) imprints. such contamination is inherent in maps based on infrared emission, which pick up not only galactic dust but also the cosmic infrared background (cib). when sfd is used for extinction correction, overcorrection occurs in a spatially correlated and redshift-dependent manner, which could impact precision cosmology using galaxy clustering, lensing, and type ia supernova distances. similarly, lss imprints in other galactic templates can affect intensity mapping and cosmic microwave background experiments. this paper presents a generic way to remove lss traces in galactic maps and applies it to sfd. first, we measure descriptive summary statistics of the cib in sfd by cross-correlating the map with spectroscopic galaxies and quasars in the sloan digital sky survey tomographically as functions of redshift and angular scale. to reconstruct the lss on the map level, however, additional information on the phases is needed. we build a large set of 180 overcomplete, full-sky basis template maps from the density fields of over 600 million galaxies in the wide-field infrared survey explorer and find a linear combination that reproduces all of the high-dimensional tomographic two-point statistics of the cib in sfd. after subtracting this reconstructed lss/cib field, the end product is a full-sky galactic dust-reddening map that supersedes sfd, carrying all galactic features therein, with maximally suppressed cib. we release this new dust map dubbed csfd-the corrected sfd-at https://idv.sinica.edu.tw/ykchiang/csfd.html and nasa's lambda archive.",AB_0505
"virulence proteins in pathogens are essential for causing disease in a host. they enable the pathogen to invade, survive and multiply within the host, thus enhancing its potential to cause disease while also causing evasion of host defense mechanisms. identifying these factors, especially potential vaccine candidates or drug targets, is critical for vaccine or drug development research. in this context, we present an improved version of virulentpred 1.0 for rapidly identifying virulent proteins. the virulentpred 2.0 is based on training machine learning models with experimentally validated virulent protein sequences. virulentpred 2.0 achieved 84.71% accuracy with the validation dataset and 85.18% on an independent test dataset. the models are trained and evaluated with the latest sequence datasets of virulent proteins, which are three times greater in number than the proteins used in the earlier version of virulentpred. moreover, a significant improvement of 11% in the prediction accuracy over the earlier version is achieved with the best position-specific scoring matrix (pssm)-based model for the latest test dataset. virulentpred 2.0 is available as a user-friendly web interface at https://bioinfo.icgeb.res.in/virulent2/ and a standalone application suitable for bulk predictions. with higher efficiency and availability as a standalone tool, virulentpred 2.0 holds immense potential for high throughput yet efficient identification of virulent proteins in bacterial pathogens.",AB_0505
"backgroundthe importance of informal caregivers for persons with severe mental illness has been demonstrated. however, this role may cause a high care burden that considerably affects caregiver health. the ensemble program is a five-session brief individual intervention designed to support informal caregivers. this trial aimed to assess the efficacy of the program versus sau (support as usual) for participants with a high care burden.methodsa single-center randomized controlled trial including 149 participants was conducted. caregivers in the intervention arm participated in the ensemble program. the effects of the intervention were assessed using mixed models for repeated measures analysis of variance on improvements in informal caregivers' psychological health status, optimism levels, burden scores, and quality of life at three time points (t0 = pretest; t1 = posttest at 2 months, and t2 = follow-up at 4 months).resultsanalysis of the global psychological index showed no significant effect at the two endpoints in favor of the ensemble group. however, the brief symptom inventory-positive symptom distress index was significantly lower at the two-month follow-up. a significant reduction in burden on the zarit burden interview was observed post-intervention, along with an increase in optimism levels on the life orientation test-revised at follow-up in the ensemble group. no significant differences were observed in quality of life. clinical improvements in both psychological health status and burden levels were also identified.conclusionthe ensemble program offers an inclusive approach based on a recovery perspective that significantly reduces symptom distress and burden and increases optimism among informal caregivers.clinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, nct04020497.conclusionthe ensemble program offers an inclusive approach based on a recovery perspective that significantly reduces symptom distress and burden and increases optimism among informal caregivers.clinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, nct04020497.",AB_0505
"cyprinus carpio is regarded as a substitute vertebrate fish model for zebrafish. a varied category of non-coding rnas is comprised of long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) and circular rnas (circrnas). these ncrnas were once considered non-functional junk dna but research now shows they play important roles in gene expression regulation, chromatin modification, and epigenetic regulation. the systemic tissue-specific research of the lncrnas and circrnas of c. carpio is yet unexplored. a total of 468 raw rna-seq dataset across 28 distinct tissues from different varieties of common carp retrieved from public domain were pre-processing, mapped and assembled for lncrna identification/ classification using various bioinformatics tools. a total of 33,990 lncrnas were identified along with revelation of 9 mirnas having 19 unique lncrnas acting as their precursors. additionally, 2,837 mirnas were found to target 4,782 distinct lncrnas in the lncrna-mirna-mrna interaction network analysis, which resulted in the involvement of 3,718 mrnas in common carp. a total of 22,854 circrnas were identified tissue-wise across all the 28 tissues. moreover, the examination of the circrna-mirna-mrna interaction network revealed that 15,731 circrnas were targeted by 5,906 distinct mirnas, which in turn targeted 4,524 mrnas in common carp. significant signaling pathways like necroptosis, nod-like receptor signaling pathway, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, small cell lung cancer, mapk signaling pathway, etc. were identified using gene ontology and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes. the web resource of common carp ncrnas, named ccncrnadb and available at http://backlin.cabgrid.res.in/ccncrnadb/ gives a comprehensive information about common carp lncrnas, circrnas, and cernas interactions, which can aid in investigating their functional roles for its management.",AB_0505
