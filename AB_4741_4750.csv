"background: emergency visits after colorectal surgery are common and require significant health care resources. however, many visits may be avoidable with alternative access to care. mobile health technologies can facilitate patient access to health care providers. objective: we hypothesized that a mobile app for postdischarge monitoring with patient-provider communication ability would reduce emergency visits after elective abdominopelvic colorectal surgery. design: this is a prospective cohort study with a regression analysis after coarsened exact matching. setting: the study was conducted at a single colorectal referral center from may 2019 to september 2020. patients: a total of 114 patients were recruited to the intervention and were matched to a retrospective cohort of 608 patients from the 24 months before the study. all patients were managed according to an enhanced recovery pathway. interventions: a mobile phone app comprised of patient education material, daily questionnaires assessing postdischarge recovery, and patient-provider chat function was used. main outcome measures: the primary outcomes included potentially preventable 30-day emergency visits defined according to a validated algorithm. secondary outcomes included length of stay, complications, total emergency department visits, readmissions, and app usability. results: coarsened-exact matching resulted in a matched sample of 94 prospective intervention patients and 256 retrospective control patients. the prospective group was associated with fewer preventable emergency department visits (incidence rate ratio 0.34; p = 0.043) and shorter length of stay (-1.62 days; p = 0.011). there were no differences in 30-day complications, total number of emergency visits, or readmissions. patient-reported usability of the mobile app was high, with 88% of patients reporting that the app improved their ability to communicate with their surgeon. limitations: we did not account for patient activation or perform a cost-analysis. conclusion: use of a mobile app was associated with fewer potentially preventable emergency visits and shorter length of stay after major elective colorectal surgery, which may be due to enhanced postdischarge monitoring and patient-provider communication. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b878.",AB_0475
"background: high-throughput sequencing technologies have led to an unprecedented explosion in the amounts of sequencing data available, which are typically stored using fasta and fastq files. we can find in the literature several tools to process and manipulate those type of files with the aim of transforming sequence data into biological knowledge. however, none of them are well fitted for processing efficiently very large files, likely in the order of terabytes in the following years, since they are based on sequential processing. only some routines of the well-known seqkit tool are partly parallelized. in any case, its scalability is limited to use few threads on a single computing node. results: our approach, bigseqkit, takes advantage of a high-performance computing-big data framework to parallelize and optimize the commands included in seqkit with the aim of speeding up the manipulation of fasta/fastq files. in this way, in most cases, it is from tens to hundreds of times faster than several state-of-the-art tools. at the same time, our toolkit is easy to use and install on any kind of hardware platform (local server or cluster), and its routines can be used as a bioinformatics library or from the command line. conclusions: bigseqkit is a very complete and ultra-fast toolkit to process and manipulate large fasta and fastq files. it is publicly available at https://github.com/citiususc/bigseqkit",AB_0475
"backgroundin the field of disability and rehabilitation, participation in society has become an important therapeutic objective due to its potential impact on rehabilitation, prognosis, and patient's mid and long-term well-being. however, only a few studies have explored this issue in relation with the subjective perspective of individuals with disabilities about their decision-making capacity and satisfaction with the activities in which they participate.objectiveour aim is to analyze the relationship between participation in society of people with disabilities and both emotional well-being and quality of life, including variables about subjective perspective of participation (satisfaction) and the ability to decide and pursue their own preferences.methodthe cross-sectional study presented here includes 424 participants with disabilities over 18-years-old from spain. this research is part of a larger ongoing longitudinal cohort study called participa (https://participa.guttmann.com/en/). participants were asked to complete several on-line surveys to explore quality of life, emotional well-being, participation in society, self-determination, and independent living.resultsthe results revealed an association between the dimensions of participation satisfaction, self-determination, and levels of independent living with both quality of life and emotional well-being. mediation models indicated that satisfaction and self-determination partially mediated the relationship between independent living and both quality of life and emotional well-being.conclusionthe level of independent living, self-determination, and satisfaction with participation are fundamental aspects for promoting a high quality of life and emotional well-being in people with disabilities. these findings carry significant implications for health and social services, as well as policies guidelines, highlighting the need to prioritize empowerment and self-determination in all interventions designed for people with disabilities.",AB_0475
"introductionpro-thrombotic events are one of the prevalent causes of intensive care unit (icu) admissions among covid-19 patients, although the signaling events in the stimulated platelets are still unclear.methodswe conducted a comparative analysis of platelet transcriptome data from healthy donors, icu, and non-icu covid-19 patients to elucidate these mechanisms. to surpass previous analyses, we constructed models of involved networks and control cascades by integrating a global human signaling network with transcriptome data. we investigated the control of platelet hyperactivation and the specific proteins involved.resultsour study revealed that control of the platelet network in icu patients is significantly higher than in non-icu patients. non-icu patients require control over fewer proteins for managing platelet hyperactivity compared to icu patients. identification of indispensable proteins highlighted key subnetworks, that are targetable for system control in covid-19-related platelet hyperactivity. we scrutinized fda-approved drugs targeting indispensable proteins and identified fostamatinib as a potent candidate for preventing thrombosis in covid-19 patients.discussionour findings shed light on how sars-cov-2 efficiently affects host platelets by targeting indispensable and critical proteins involved in the control of platelet activity. we evaluated several drugs for specific control of platelet hyperactivity in icu patients suffering from platelet hyperactivation. the focus of our approach is repurposing existing drugs for optimal control over the signaling network responsible for platelet hyperactivity in covid-19 patients. our study offers specific pharmacological recommendations, with drug prioritization tailored to the distinct network states observed in each patient condition. interactive networks and detailed results can be accessed at https://fostamatinib.bioinfo-wuerz.eu/.",AB_0475
"the use of small ruminants, mainly sheep and goats, is increasing in biomedical research. small ruminants are a desirable animal model due to their human-like anatomy and physiology. however, the large variability between studies and lack of baseline data on these animals creates a barrier to further research. this knowledge gap includes a lack of computed tomography (ct) scans for healthy subjects. full body, contrast enhanced ct scans of caprine and ovine subjects were acquired for subsequent modeling studies. scans were acquired from an ovine specimen (male, khatadin, 30-35 kg) and caprine specimen (female, nubian 30-35 kg). scans were acquired with and without contrast. contrast enhanced scans utilized 1.7 ml/kg of contrast administered at 2 ml/s and scans were acquired 20 seconds, 80 seconds, and 5 minutes post-contrast. scans were taken at 100 kv and 400 ma. each scan was reconstructed using a bone window and a soft tissue window. sixteen full body image data sets are presented (2 specimens by 4 contrast levels by 2 reconstruction windows) and are available for download through the form located at: https://redcap.link/coscandata. scans showed that the post-contrast timing and scan reconstruction method affected structural visualization. the data are intended for further biomedical research on ruminants related to computational model development, device prototyping, comparative diagnostics, intervention planning, and other forms of translational research.",AB_0475
"low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (also known as genome skimming) is becoming an increasingly affordable approach to large-scale phylogenetic analyses. while already routinely used to recover organellar genomes, genome skimming is rather rarely utilized for recovering single-copy nuclear markers. one reason might be that only few tools exist to work with this data type within a phylogenomic context, especially to deal with fragmented genome assemblies. we here present a new software tool called patchwork for mining phylogenetic markers from highly fragmented short-read assemblies as well as directly from sequence reads. patchwork is an alignment-based tool that utilizes the sequence aligner diamond and is written in the programming language julia. homologous regions are obtained via a sequence similarity search, followed by a hit stitching phase, in which adjacent or overlapping regions are merged into a single unit. the novel sliding window algorithm trims away any noncoding regions from the resulting sequence. we demonstrate the utility of patchwork by recovering near-universal single-copy orthologs within a benchmarking study, and we additionally assess the performance of patchwork in comparison with other programs. we find that patchwork allows for accurate retrieval of (putatively) single-copy genes from genome skimming data sets at different sequencing depths with high computational speed, outperforming existing software targeting similar tasks. patchwork is released under the gnu general public license version 3. installation instructions, additional documentation, and the source code itself are all available via github at https://github.com/fethalen/patchwork.",AB_0475
"background the psychiatry, neurology, psychosomatics and psychotherapy (pnp) program of the german statutory health insurance aok bw promotes coordinated and evidence-based specialist care with the aim of providing individualized, guideline-based outpatient care, strengthening the collaboration between health care providers, as well as reducing care costs. the purpose of this study was to evaluate its effectiveness regarding patient-reported outcomes compared to the less specialized general practitioner program (gp) and usual care (uc). materials and methods aok insured patients, who were on sick leave due to a mental disorder (affective disorder, anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder, somatoform disorder, alcohol abuse disorder, schizophrenia) or multiple sclerosis were included in the prospective non-randomized controlled study. all patients either participated in the pnp program (intervention group, ig-pnp), the general practitioner program (control group, cg-gp) or usual care (control group, cg-uc). entropy balancing was used to adjust for baseline imbalance between groups. primary outcome was health-related quality of life, assessed by the short-form health survey (sf-36) 12 months after diagnosis. secondary outcomes included symptom severity, functional health, and treatment satisfaction. results of the 14,483 insured patients who were contacted, 1,104 patients participated at baseline and 725 at follow-up. the adjusted mean differences of sf-36 sum score did not significantly differ between groups: -1.89 (95%-ci = -4.60; 0.81, p = 0.170) between ig-pnp and cg-gp, and -1.42 (95%-ci = -4.05; 1.22, p = 0.293) between pnp and cg-uc. the adjusted mean differences of secondary outcomes did not differ between groups, except for a slightly higher increase of functional health in cg-uc. conclusion we found no evidence that the pnp program is superior to the gp program or to usual care in terms of patient-reported outcomes or treatment satisfaction. the results are limited by the low response rate. accordingly, future studies should strive for more representative samples. to improve the program, an integration of further collaborative care elements and guideline recommendations might be useful.clinical trial registrationdrks (german clinical trials register https://drks.de/search/en); identifier (drks00013114).",AB_0475
"backgroundwithin the ageing population of western societies, an increasing number of older people have multiple chronic conditions. because multiple health problems require the involvement of several health professionals, multimorbid older people often face a fragmented health care system. to address these challenges, in a two-group parallel randomized controlled trial, a newly developed care management approach (lochro-care) was compared with usual care.methodslochro-care consists of individualized care provided by chronic care managers with 7 to 16 contacts over 12 months. patients aged 65 + with chronic conditions were recruited from inpatient and outpatient departments. healthcare utilization costs are calculated by using an adapted version of the generic, self-reporting fima (c)-questionnaire with the application of standardized unit costs. questionnaires were given at 3 time points (t0 baseline, t1 after 12 months, t2 after 18 months). the primary outcome was overall 3-month costs of healthcare utilization at t1 and t2. the data were analyzed using generalized linear models with log-link and gamma distribution and adjustment for age, sex, level of care as well as the 3-month costs of care at t0.resultsthree hundred thirty patients were analyzed. the results showed no significant difference in the costs of healthcare utilization between participants who received lochro-care and those who received usual care, regardless of whether the costs were evaluated 12 (adjusted mean difference euro 130.99, 95%ci euro-1477.73 to euro1739.71, p = 0.873) or 18 (adjusted mean difference euro192.99, 95%ci euro-1894.66 to euro2280.65, p = 0.856) months after the start of the intervention.conclusionthis study revealed no differences in costs between older people receiving lochro-care or usual care. before implementing the intervention, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to provide robust evidence on the cost effects of lochro-care.trial registrationgerman clinical trials register (drks): drks00013904, https://drks.de/search/de/trial/drks00013904; date of first registration 02/02/2018.",AB_0475
"motivation large-scale clinical proteomics datasets of infectious pathogens, combined with antimicrobial resistance outcomes, have recently opened the door for machine learning models which aim to improve clinical treatment by predicting resistance early. however, existing prediction frameworks typically train a separate model for each antimicrobial and species in order to predict a pathogen's resistance outcome, resulting in missed opportunities for chemical knowledge transfer and generalizability.results we demonstrate the effectiveness of multimodal learning over proteomic and chemical features by exploring two clinically relevant tasks for our proposed deep learning models: drug recommendation and generalized resistance prediction. by adopting this multi-view representation of the pathogenic samples and leveraging the scale of the available datasets, our models outperformed the previous single-drug and single-species predictive models by statistically significant margins. we extensively validated the multi-drug setting, highlighting the challenges in generalizing beyond the training data distribution, and quantitatively demonstrate how suitable representations of antimicrobial drugs constitute a crucial tool in the development of clinically relevant predictive models.availability and implementation the code used to produce the results presented in this article is available at https://github.com/borgwardtlab/multimodalamr.",AB_0475
"backgroundallergies against implant materials are still not fully understood. despite controversies about its relevance, some patients need treatment with hypoallergenic implants. this study compared coated and standard total knee arthroplasty (tka) regarding inflammatory response and patient-reported outcome measures (proms).methods76 patients without self-reported allergies against implant materials were included in a rct and received a coated or standard tka of the same cemented posterior-stabilized knee system. 73 patients completed the 3-year follow-up. two patients died and there was one revision surgery. serum levels of cytokines with a possible role in implant allergy were measured in patient`s serum (il-1beta, il-5, il-6, il-8, il-10, ifn gamma, tnf alpha) prior to, one and three years after surgery. furthermore, proms including knee function (oxford knee score, knee society score) and health-related quality of life (qol, euroquol questionnaire) were assessed. additionally, 8 patients with patch-test proven skin allergy against implant materials who received the coated implant were assessed similarly and compared to a matched-pair group receiving the same implant.resultsthere were no differences in function and qol between the assessed groups at any follow-up. the majority of patients demonstrated no elevation of the measured blood cytokines. cytokine patterns showed no differences between study groups at any follow-up. the allergy patients demonstrated slower functional improvement and minor differences in cytokine pattern. yet these results were not significant. there were no differences in the matched-pair analysis.conclusionwe observed no relevant increase in serum cytokine levels in any group. the inflammatory response measured seems limited, even in allergy patients. furthermore, there were no differences between coated and standard tka in non-allergy patients in the 3-year follow-up period.trial registrationthe study protocol was registered in the us national institutes of health's database (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) registry under nct03424174 on 03/17/2016.",AB_0475
