"most vision-based 3d pose estimation approaches typically rely on knowledge of object's 3d model, depth measurements, and often require time-consuming iterative refinement to improve accuracy. however, these can be seen as limiting factors for broader real-life applications. the main motivation for this paper is to address these limitations. to solve this, a novel convolutional variational auto-encoder based multi-level network for object 3d pose estimation (cvml-pose) method is proposed. unlike most other methods, the proposed cvml-pose implicitly learns an object's 3d pose from only rgb images encoded in its latent space without knowing the object's 3d model, depth information, or performing a post-refinement. cvml-pose consists of two main modules: (i) cvml-ae representing convolutional variational autoencoder, whose role is to extract features from rgb images, (ii) multi-layer perceptron and k-nearest neighbor regressors mapping the latent variables to object 3d pose including, respectively, rotation and translation. the proposed cvml-pose has been evaluated on the linemod and linemod-occlusion benchmark datasets. it has been shown to outperform other methods based on latent representations and achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art, but without use of a 3d model or depth measurements. utilizing the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding algorithm, the cvml-pose latent space is shown to successfully represent objects' category and topology. this opens up a prospect of integrated estimation of pose and other attributes (possibly also including surface finish or shape variations), which, with real-time processing due to the absence of iterative refinement, can facilitate various robotic applications. code available: https://github.com/jzhao12/cvml-pose.",AB_0451
"background: over-the-counter (otc) medications are frequently used to self-care for nonspecific ovarian cancer symptoms prior to diagnosis. monitoring such purchases may provide an opportunity for earlier diagnosis. objective: the aim of the cancer loyalty card study (clocs) was to investigate purchases of otc pain and indigestion medications prior to ovarian cancer diagnosis in women with and without ovarian cancer in the united kingdom using loyalty card data. methods: an observational case-control study was performed comparing purchases of otc pain and indigestion medications prior to diagnosis in women with (n=153) and without (n=120) ovarian cancer using loyalty card data from two uk-based high street retailers. monthly purchases of pain and indigestion medications for cases and controls were compared using the fisher exact test, conditional logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve analysis. results: pain and indigestion medication purchases were increased among cases 8 months before diagnosis, with maximum discrimination between cases and controls 8 months before diagnosis (fisher exact odds ratio [or] 2.9, 95% ci 2.1-4.1). an increase in indigestion medication purchases was detected up to 9 months before diagnosis (adjusted conditional logistic regression or 1.38, 95% ci 1.04-1.83). the roc analysis for indigestion medication purchases showed a maximum area under the curve (auc) at 13 months before diagnosis (auc=0.65, 95% ci 0.57-0.73), which further improved when stratified to late-stage conclusions: there is a difference in purchases of pain and indigestion medications among women with and without ovarian cancer up to 8 months before diagnosis. facilitating earlier presentation among those who self-care for symptoms using this novel data source could improve ovarian cancer patients' options for treatment and improve survival. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct03994653; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03994653",AB_0451
"in this paper, we address the task of semantic-guided image generation. one challenge common to most existing image-level generation methods is the difficulty in generating small objects and detailed local textures. to address this, in this work we consider generating images using local context. as such, we design a local class-specific generative network using semantic maps as guidance, which separately constructs and learns subgenerators for different classes, enabling it to capture finer details. to learn more discriminative class-specific feature representations for the local generation, we also propose a novel classification module. to combine the advantages of both global image-level and local class-specific generation, a joint generation network is designed with an attention fusion module and a dual-discriminator structure embedded. lastly, we propose a novel semantic-aware upsampling method, which has a larger receptive field and can take far-away pixels that are semantically related for feature upsampling, enabling it to better preserve semantic consistency for instances with the same semantic labels. extensive experiments on two image generation tasks show the superior performance of the proposed method. state-of-the-art results are established by large margins on both tasks and on nine challenging public benchmarks. the source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/ha0tang/lggan.",AB_0451
"humans drive in a holistic fashion which entails, in particular, understanding dynamic road events and their evolution. injecting these capabilities in autonomous vehicles can thus take situational awareness and decision making closer to human-level performance. to this purpose, we introduce the road event awareness dataset (road) for autonomous driving, to our knowledge the first of its kind. road is designed to test an autonomous vehicle's ability to detect road events, defined as triplets composed by an active agent, the action(s) it performs and the corresponding scene locations. road comprises videos originally from the oxford robotcar dataset, annotated with bounding boxes showing the location in the image plane of each road event. we benchmark various detection tasks, proposing as a baseline a new incremental algorithm for online road event awareness termed 3d-retinanet. we also report the performance on the road tasks of slowfast and yolov5 detectors, as well as that of the winners of the iccv2021 road challenge, which highlight the challenges faced by situation awareness in autonomous driving. road is designed to allow scholars to investigate exciting tasks such as complex (road) activity detection, future event anticipation and continual learning. the dataset is available at https://github.com/gurkirt/road-dataset; the baseline can be found at https://github.com/gurkirt/3d-retinanet.",AB_0451
"in human health research, metabolic signatures extracted from metabolomics data have a strong added value for stratifying patients and identifying biomarkers. nevertheless, one of the main challenges is to interpret and relate these lists of discriminant metabolites to pathological mechanisms. this task requires experts to combine their knowledge with information extracted from databases and the scientific literature. however, we show that most compounds (>99%) in the pubchem database lack annotated literature. this dearth of available information can have a direct impact on the interpretation of metabolic signatures, which is often restricted to a subset of significant metabolites. to suggest potential pathological phenotypes related to overlooked metabolites that lack annotated literature, we extend the guilt-by-association principle to literature information by using a bayesian framework. the underlying assumption is that the literature associated with the metabolic neighbors of a compound can provide valuable insights, or an a priori, into its biomedical context. the metabolic neighborhood of a compound can be defined from a metabolic network and correspond to metabolites to which it is connected through biochemical reactions. with the proposed approach, we suggest more than 35,000 associations between 1,047 overlooked metabolites and 3,288 diseases (or disease families). all these newly inferred associations are freely available on the forum ftp server (see information at https://github.com/emetabohub/forum-literaturepropagation).",AB_0451
"prediction of the response of cancer patients to different treatments and identification of biomarkers of drug response are two major goals of individualized medicine. here, we developed a deep learning framework called tindl, completely trained on preclinical cancer cell lines (ccls), to predict the response of cancer patients to different treatments. tindl utilizes a tissue-informed normalization to account for the tissue type and cancer type of the tumors and to reduce the statistical discrepancies between ccls and patient tumors. moreover, by making the deep learning black box interpretable, this model identifies a small set of genes whose expression levels are predictive of drug response in the trained model, enabling identification of biomarkers of drug response. using data from two large databases of ccls and cancer tumors, we showed that this model can distinguish between sensitive and resistant tumors for 10 (out of 14) drugs, outperforming various other machine learning models. in addition, our small interfering rna (sirna) knockdown experiments on 10 genes identified by this model for one of the drugs (tamoxifen) confirmed that tamoxifen sensitivity is substantially influenced by all of these genes in mcf7 cells, and seven of these genes in t47d cells. furthermore, genes implicated for multiple drugs pointed to shared mechanism of action among drugs and suggested several important signaling pathways. in summary, this study provides a powerful deep learning framework for prediction of drug response and identification of biomarkers of drug response in cancer. the code can be accessed at https://github.com/ddhostallero/tindl.",AB_0451
"colorectal cancer (crc) is a major global health concern, resulting in numerous cancer-related deaths. crc detection, treatment, and prevention can be improved by identifying genes and biomarkers. despite extensive research, the underlying mechanisms of crc remain elusive, and previously identified biomarkers have not yielded satisfactory insights. this shortfall may be attributed to the predominance of univariate analysis methods, which overlook potential combinations of variants and genes contributing to disease development. here, we address this knowledge gap by presenting a novel multivariate machine-learning strategy to pinpoint genes associated with crc. additionally, we applied our analysis pipeline to inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), as ibd patients face substantial crc risk. the importance of the identified genes was substantiated by rigorous validation across numerous independent datasets. several of the discovered genes have been previously linked to crc, while others represent novel findings warranting further investigation. a python implementation of our pipeline can be accessed publicly at https://github.com/ariasar/crcibd-ml.",AB_0451
"one challenge faced by scientists from the alternative rna splicing field is to decode the cooperative or antagonistic effects of splicing factors (sfs) to understand and eventually predict splicing outcomes on a genome-wide scale. in this manuscript, we introduce splicinglore, an open-access database and web resource that help to fill this gap in a straightforward manner. the database contains a collection of rna-sequencing-derived lists of alternative exons regulated by a total of 75 different sfs. all datasets were processed in a standardized manner, ensuring valid comparisons and correlation analyses. the user can easily retrieve a factor-specific set of differentially included exons from the database or provide a list of exons and search which sf(s) control(s) their inclusion. our simple workflow is fast and easy to run, and it ensures a reliable calculation of correlation scores between the tested datasets. as a proof of concept, we predicted and experimentally validated a novel functional cooperation between the rna helicases ddx17 and ddx5 and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein c (hnrnpc) protein. splicinglore is available at https://splicinglore.ens-lyon.fr/.database url: https://splicinglore.ens-lyon.fr/",AB_0451
"the local disordered region sampling (ldrs, pronounced loaders) tool is a new module developed for idpconformergenerator, a previously validated approach to model intrinsically disordered proteins (idps). the idpconformergenerator ldrs module provides a method for generating all-atom conformations of intrinsically disordered protein regions at n- and c-termini of and in loops or linkers between folded regions of an existing protein structure. these disordered elements often lead to missing coordinates in experimental structures or low confidence in predicted structures. requiring only a pre-existing pdb or mmcif formatted structural template of the protein with missing coordinates or with predicted confidence scores and its full-length primary sequence, ldrs will automatically generate physically meaningful conformational ensembles of the missing flexible regions to complete the full-length protein. the capabilities of the ldrs tool of idpconformergenerator include modeling phosphorylation sites using enhanced monte carlo-side chain entropy, transmembrane proteins within an all-atom bilayer, and multi-chain complexes. the modeling capacity of ldrs capitalizes on the modularity, the ability to be used as a library and via command-line, and the computational speed of the idpconformergenerator platform. availability and implementation: the ldrs module is part of the idpconformergenerator modeling suite, which can be downloaded from github at https://github.com/julie-forman-kay-lab/idpconformergenerator. idpconformergenerator is written in python3 and works on linux, microsoft windows, and mac os versions that support dssp. users can utilize ldrs's python api for scripting the same way they can use any part of idpconformergenerator's api, by importing functions from the idpconfgen.ldrs_helper library. otherwise, ldrs can be used as a command line interface application within idpconformergenerator. full documentation is available within the command-line interface as well as on idpconformergenerator's official documentation pages (https://idpconformergenerator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).",AB_0451
"amyloid proteins are often associated with the onset of diseases, including alzheimer's, parkinson's and many others. however, there is a wide class of functional amyloids that are involved in physiological functions, e.g., formation of microbial biofilms or storage of hormones. recent studies showed that an amyloid fibril could affect the aggregation of another protein, even from a different species. this may result in amplification or attenuation of the aggregation process. insight into amyloid cross-interactions may be crucial for better understanding of amyloid diseases and the potential influence of microbial amyloids on human proteins. however, due to the demanding nature of the needed experiments, knowledge of such interactions is still limited. here, we present pact (prediction of amyloid cross-interaction by threading) - the computational method for the prediction of amyloid cross-interactions. the method is based on modeling of a heterogeneous fibril formed by two amyloidogenic peptides. the resulting structure is assessed by the structural statistical potential that approximates its plausibility and energetic stability. pact was developed and first evaluated mostly on data collected in the amylograph database of interacting amyloids and achieved high values of area under roc (auc=0.88) and f1 (0.82). then, we applied our method to study the interactions of csga - a bacterial biofilm protein that was not used in our in-reference datasets, which is expressed in several bacterial species that inhabit the human intestines - with two human proteins. the study included alpha-synuclein, a human protein that is involved in parkinson's disease, and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hiapp), which is involved in type 2 diabetes. in both cases, pact predicted the appearance of cross-interactions. importantly, the method indicated specific regions of the proteins, which were shown to play a central role in both interactions. we experimentally confirmed the novel results of the indicated csga fragments interacting with hiapp based on the kinetic characteristics obtained with the tht assay. pact opens the possibility of high-throughput studies of amyloid interactions. importantly, it can work with fairly long protein fragments, and as a purely physicochemical approach, it relies very little on scarce training data. the tool is available as a web server at https://pact.e-science.pl/pact/. the local version can be downloaded from https://github.com/kubawojciechowski/pact.",AB_0451
