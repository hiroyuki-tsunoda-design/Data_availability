"mass spectrometry imaging (msi) is a powerful tool that can be used to simultaneously investigate the spatial distribution of different molecules in samples. however, it is difficult to comprehensively analyze complex biological systems with only a single analytical technique due to different analytical properties and application limitations. therefore, many analytical methods have been combined to extend data interpretation, evaluate data credibility, and facilitate data mining to explore important temporal and spatial relationships in biological systems. image registration is an initial and critical step for multimodal imaging data fusion. however, the image registration of multi modal images is not a simple task. the property difference between each data modality may include spatial resolution, image characteristics, or both. the image registrations between msi and different imaging techniques are often achieved indirectly through histology. many methods exist for image registration between msi data and histological images. however, most of them are manual or semiautomatic and have their prerequisites. here, we built msi registrar (msir), a web service for automatic registration between msi and histology. it can help to reduce subjectivity and processing time efficiently. msir provides an interface for manually selecting region of interests from histological images; the user selects regions of interest to extract the corresponding spectrum indices in msi data. in the performance evaluation, msir can quickly map msi data to histological images and help pinpoint molecular components at specific locations in tissues. most registrations were adequate and were without excessive shifts. msir is freely available at https://msir.cmdm.tw and https://github. com/cmdm-lab/msir.",AB_0523
"study objectives: the first reports of narcolepsy with cataplexy in russia were made by mankovsky (the pathogenesis of narcolepsy (the case of epidemic encephalitis with cataplexy) published in the sovremennaya psihonevrologia) in 1925. the largest series of patients (n = 110) was reported by a. vein (doctoral thesis: hypersomnia syndrome) in 1964. however, until today, narcolepsy remained relatively unknown in russia. the aim of this study is to report clinical and polysomnography (psg)/multiple sleep latency test (mslt) results in the russian population and compare them with the european narcolepsy network (eu-nn) data (n = 1099) reported. methods: eleven sleep centers from russia agreed to participate and completed a questionnaire including 58 questions concerning demographic, clinical, psg, and mslt data. results: there were 89 patients with a mean age of 35.6 & plusmn; 16.9 years (& plusmn; here and further indicates standard deviation), 58% males, and 42% females. narcolepsy started at a mean age of 25.6 & plusmn; 14.6 years (range 5-74 years). the mean epworth sleepiness scale score was 18.4 & plusmn; 3.5 points (range: 11-24). sleep paralysis was reported by 59.1%, and hallucinations by 82% of patients. in mslt, & ge; 2 sleep-onset rem (rapid eye movement) periods (soremps) were found in 81.6%. no center provided human leukocyte antigen (hla) or cerebral spinal fluid hypocretin data. conclusions: clinical and neurophysiological data from this first study of the russian narcolepsy network suggest a similar profile to the recently reported eu-nn data. the more severe and higher percentage of patients with cataplexy and presenting with both excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy may reflect low awareness of narcolepsy in russia. clinical trial registration: registry: clinicaltrials.gov; url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct05375890; name: clinical and neurophysiological characteristics of narcolepsy; identifier: nct05375890.",AB_0523
"nature plays a major role in the development of new drugs which helps in preventing and treating human diseases. anti-obesity compound database (aocd) contains comprehensive information on all published small molecules from natural sources with anti-obesity potential targeting pancreatic lipase (pl), appetite suppressant (as) and adipogenesis (ad). presently the database contains 349 compounds isolated from 307 plants, 26 marine and 16 microbial sources. users can query the aocd database (https://aocd.swmd.co.in/) in several ways. the database was divided into three datasets (pl, as and ad) to perform chemoinformatic analysis using platform for unified molecular analysis (puma), which were analyzed based on molecular descriptors, scaffold diversity and structural fingerprint diversity. chemoinformatics study inferred the pl dataset has the highest diversity of compounds based on the euclidean distance on molecular properties, scaffold diversity and pairwise similarity on fingerprint diversity. this study would hasten the process of anti-obesity drug discovery.",AB_0523
"this article documents enu, a freely-downloadable, open-source and stand-alone program written in c++ for the enumeration of the constitutional isomers and stereoisomers of a molecular formula. the program relies on graph theory to enumerate all the constitutional isomers of a given formula on the basis of their canonical adjacency matrix. the stereoisomers of a given constitutional isomer are enumerated as well, on the basis of the automorphism group of this matrix. the isomer list is then reported in the form of canonical smiles strings within files in xml format. the specification of the molecule family of interest is very flexible and the code is optimized for computational efficiency. the algorithms and implementations underlying enu are described, and simple illustrative applications are presented. the enu code is freely available on github at https://github.com/csms-ethz/combiff.",AB_0523
"introductionceliac disease (cd) is an autoimmune gastrointestinal disorder causes immune-mediated enteropathy against gluten. gluten immunogenic peptides have the potential to trigger immune responses which leads to damage the small intestine. hla-dq2/dq8 are major alleles that bind to epitope/antigenic region of gluten and induce celiac disease. there is a need to identify cd associated epitopes in protein-based foods and therapeutics. methodsin this study, computational tools have been developed to predict cd associated epitopes and motifs. dataset used for training, testing and evaluation contain experimentally validated cd associated and non-cd associate peptides. we perform positional analysis to identify the most significant position of an amino acid residue in the peptide and checked the frequency of hla alleles. we also compute amino acid composition to develop machine learning based models. we also developed ensemble method that combines motif-based approach and machine learning based models. results and discussionour analysis support existing hypothesis that proline (p) and glutamine (q) are highly abundant in cd associated peptides. a model based on density of p&q in peptides has been developed for predicting cd associated peptides which achieve maximum auroc 0.98 on independent data. we discovered motifs (e.g., qpf, qpq, pyp) which occurs specifically in cd associated peptides. we also developed machine learning based models using peptide composition and achieved maximum auroc 0.99. finally, we developed ensemble method that combines motif-based approach and machine learning based models. the ensemble model-predict cd associated motifs with 100% accuracy on an independent dataset, not used for training. finally, the best models and motifs has been integrated in a web server and standalone software package cdpred. we hope this server anticipate the scientific community for the prediction, designing and scanning of cd associated peptides as well as cd associated motifs in a protein/peptide sequence (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/cdpred/).",AB_0523
"glucokinase (gk), an isoform of hexokinase expressed predominantly in liver, pancreas and hypothalamus is crucial to blood glucose management. it is a critical component of the glucose-sensing mechanism of the pancreatic islet cells and glycogen regulation in hepatocytes. gk modulators such as allosteric gkas (glucokinase activators) and gk-gkrp (glucokinase regulatory protein) disruptors have found potential applications as safer antihyperglycemics. recent studies have also demonstrated the potential of gk modulators as antiparasitic agents. researchers targeting gk often undertake the time-consuming task of independently collecting and compiling modulator information due to the lack of any dedicated single-platform resource. towards this, in the present study we demonstrate the design and development of glucokinasedb (gkdb), a comprehensive, curated, online resource of gk modulators. gkdb contains experimentally derived structural and bioactivity information of 1723 modulators along with their detailed molecular descriptors. the web-interface is user-friendly with features such as in-browser visualization, advanced search queries, cross-links to other databases and original reference etc. the bioactivity and descriptor data can be downloaded in bulk (for entire database) or for individual modulators. the 3d structures are also downloadable in multiple formats. gkdb employs a php-based web design with bootstrap styling and a mysql database backend. gkdb can be utilized for clinical and molecular research via development of pharmacophore hypotheses, qsar/qspr models, predictive machine learning models etc. gkdb is freely accessible online at https://glucokinasedb.in.",AB_0523
"several challenges prevent extracting knowledge from biomedical resources, including data heterogeneity and the difficulty to obtain and collaborate on data and annotations by medical doctors. therefore, flexibility in their representation and interconnection is required; it is also essential to be able to interact easily with such data. in recent years, semantic tools have been developed: semantic wikis are collections of wiki pages that can be annotated with properties and so combine flexibility and expressiveness, two desirable aspects when modeling databases, especially in the dynamic biomedical domain. however, semantics and collaborative analysis of biomedical data is still an unsolved challenge. the aim of this work is to create a tool for easing the design and the setup of semantic databases and to give the possibility to enrich them with biostatistical applications. as a side effect, this will also make them reproducible, fostering their application by other research groups. a command-line software has been developed for creating all structures required by semantic mediawiki. besides, a way to expose statistical analyses as r shiny applications in the interface is provided, along with a facility to export prolog predicates for reasoning with external tools. the developed software allowed to create a set of biomedical databases for the neuroscience department of the university of padova in a more automated way. they can be extended with additional qualitative and statistical analyses of data, including for instance regressions, geographical distribution of diseases, and clustering. the software is released as open source-code and published under the gpl-3 license at https:// github. com/ mfalda/ tsv2s wm.",AB_0523
"the impact of climate change has been alarming for the crop growth. the extreme weather conditions can stress the crops and reduce the yield of major crops belonging to poaceae family too, that sustains 50% of the world's food calorie and 20% of protein intake. computational approaches, such as artificial intelligence-based techniques have become the forefront of prediction-based data interpretation and plant stress responses. in this study, we proposed a novel activation function, namely, gaussian error linear unit with sigmoid (sielu) which was implemented in the development of a deep learning (dl) model along with other hyper parameters for classification of unknown abiotic stress protein sequences from crops of poaceae family. to develop this models, data pertaining to four different abiotic stress (namely, cold, drought, heat and salinity) responsive proteins of the crops belonging to poaceae family were retrieved from public domain. it was observed that efficiency of the dl models with our proposed novel sielu activation function outperformed the models as compared to gelu activation function, svm and rf with 95.11%, 80.78%, 94.97%, and 81.69% accuracy for cold, drought, heat and salinity, respectively. also, a web-based tool, named deepaprot (http://login1.cabgrid.res.in:5500/) was developed using flask api, along with its mobile app. this server/app will provide researchers a convenient tool, which is rapid and economical in identification of proteins for abiotic stress management in crops poaceae family, in endeavour of higher production for food security and combating hunger, ensuring un sdg goal 2.0.",AB_0523
"nowadays, smartphones are becoming the predominant source of video content that is being widely shared through various platforms of social media. according to recent studies, 78% of iphones and 57% of android smartphones support hardware-accelerated hevc decoding. growing usage of videos on social media applications poses the challenge of distinguishing between authentic and manipulated content. in this paper, we have proposed the development of hevc based tampered video dataset (htvd) consisting of diverse scenarios of authentic and forged videos for more comprehensive testing capabilities. the dataset will provide the researchers with a benchmark with a varied range of realistic and smartly tampered videos for validation and comparison of their forensic investigation techniques. the htvd dataset is developed from videos captured under scenarios of indoor, outdoor, and surveillance shots. it includes 60 original videos, 966 tampered videos, their corresponding ground truth information, and masks. all the original videos are captured with hevc supported smartphones. various types of inter-frame forgeries such as frame insertion, frame deletion and frame duplication, and object-based intra-frame forgeries such as cloning, splicing, and inpainting are incorporated to create a diversified database of forged videos. further, the tampered videos are provided with variations based on the encoding parameters of the codec namely, gop size, crf and frame types resulting in a total of 8,694 forged videos. to perform video tampering, the forger needs to perform recompression. however, videos may also undergo recompression while transferring over the internet or exchanged through social media applications. thus, recompression doesn't always mean that forgery has been performed. the proposed htvd dataset provides a video dataset for experimenting with both circumstances. this video dataset is publicly available on https://drive.google. com/drive/folders/143neyvjchnvddzvzizm6nteuk5-ezwb5?usp=sharing.",AB_0523
"native molecular weight (mw) is one of the defining features of proteins. denaturing gel electrophoresis (sds-page) is a very popular technique for separating proteins and determining their mw. coupled with antibody-based detection, sds-page is widely applied for protein identification and quantitation. yet, electrophoresis is poorly reproducible and the mws obtained are often inaccurate. this hampers antibody validation and negatively impacts the reliability of western blot data, resulting worldwide in a considerable waste of reagents and labour. we argue that, to alleviate these problems there is a need to establish a database of reference mws measured by sds-page. using mass spectrometry as an orthogonal detec-tion method, we acquired electrophoretic migration patterns for approximately 100000 human proteins in five commonly used cell lines. we applied a robust internal calibration of migration to determine accurate and reproducible molecular weights. this in turn allows merging replicates to increase accuracy, but also enables comparing different cell lines. mining of the data obtained highlights structural factors that affect migration of distinct classes of proteins. when combined with peptide coverage, the data produced reca-pitulates known post-translational modifications and differential splicing and can be used to formulate hypotheses on new or poorly known processing events. the full information is freely accessible as a web resource through a user friendly graphical interface (https://pumba.dcsr.unil.ch/). we anticipate that this database will be useful to investigators worldwide for troubleshooting western blot experiments, but could also contribute to the characterization of human proteoforms.(c) 2022 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0523
