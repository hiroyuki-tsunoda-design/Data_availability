"mycobacterium tuberculosis, a highly perilous pathogen in humans, serves as the causative agent of tuberculosis (tb), affecting nearly 33% of the global population. with the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant tb, there is a need for novel and efficacious alternative therapies. peptide therapies have emerged as a favorable alternative due to their remarkable specificity in targeting cells without affecting healthy cells. however, the experimental identification methods of anti-tubercular peptides (atbps) are labor-intensive and costly. therefore, accurate prediction of atbps has become challenging due to the large number of peptide samples. in this paper, we propose an ensemble learning model to enhance the prediction outcomes by addressing the limitations of individual learning models. we formulate the training samples by utilizing four distinct representation methods: aaindex, composition/transition/distribution, dipeptide deviation from expected mean, and enhanced grouped amino acid composition to numerically encode peptide samples. the feature vectors extracted from these methods are fused to develop a compact vector. we evaluate the prediction rates using three different classification models, employing both individual and heterogeneous vectors. furthermore, we enhance the prediction and training capabilities of the proposed model by using the predicted labels of the individual classifiers for implementing an ensemble deep model via a genetic algorithm. through evaluation of both the training datasets and independent datasets, our proposed ensemble learner achieves impressive accuracies of 97.80%, 95.13%, 93.91%, and 94.17%, using rd training, md training, rd independent, and md independent datasets, respectively. our findings demonstrate that the proposed patbp-enc model outperforms existing predictors by reporting approximately 11% higher training accuracy. we conclude that the patbp-enc predictor will be a considerable tool in the field of pharmaceutical design and research academia. the used datasets and the source code are publicly available at https://github.com/intelligent-models/patbp-enc2023.",AB_0414
"multispectral remote-sensing images often have band-dependent image resolution due to cost and technical limitations. to address this, we developed a method that sharpens low-resolution (lr) images using high-resolution (hr) images. in this letter, we propose a novel unsupervised deep-learning (dl) approach that involves unrolling an iterative algorithm into a deep neural network and training it using a loss function based on stein's risk unbiased estimate (sure) to sharpen the lr bands (20 and 60 m) of sentinel-2 (s2) to their highest resolution (10 m). this approach views traditional optimization model-based methods through a dl framework, improving interpretability and clarifying connections between the two approaches. results from both simulated and real s2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms competitive methods and produces high-quality sharpened images for the 20- and 60-m bands. the codes are available at https://github.com/hvn2/s2-unrolling.",AB_0414
"this paper presents a hybrid algorithm for real-time instance segmentation of packages from scenes represented by 2d distance maps (range images). the paper introduces a novel approach combining deep learning-based methods and digital signal processing methods to enable accurate package recognition, using a small training dataset with high variability and distance measurement errors characteristic of time-of-flight-based scanning. two convolutional neural networks with architecture optimized for training with a limited number of samples perform an initial segmentation of package components (sides and edges). an algorithm based on digital signal processing methods performs refinement of intermediate results, and combines package components into packages. training and evaluation of the algorithm were performed on a custom dataset containing scenes of packages, shipping bags, and packaging of irregular shapes with various sizes, orientations, and degrees of occlusion, organized either in ordered stacks or arbitrary order. the convolutional neural networks provide a reliable distinction between components of packages and components of other types of packaging and surroundings. package sides containing a sufficient number of distance points are correctly combined into packages. thus, the proposed algorithm represents a solid basis for fully automated loading/unloading of packages with arbitrary sizes and materials from transport trailers and storage spaces. the dataset and annotations for box side surfaces are available at: https://dipteam.feit.ukim.edu.mk/results-package-detection.html.",AB_0414
"the efforts in compressive sensing (cs) literature can be divided into two groups: finding a measurement matrix that preserves the compressed information at its maximum level, and finding a robust reconstruction algorithm. in the traditional cs setup, the measurement matrices are selected as random matrices, and optimization-based iterative solutions are used to recover the signals. using random matrices when handling large or multi-dimensional signals is cumbersome especially when it comes to iterative optimizations. recent deep learning-based solutions increase reconstruction accuracy while speeding up recovery, but jointly learning the whole measurement matrix remains challenging. for this reason, state-of-the-art deep learning cs solutions such as convolutional compressive sensing network (csnet) use block-wise cs schemes to facilitate learning. in this work, we introduce a separable multi-linear learning of the cs matrix by representing the measurement signal as the summation of the arbitrary number of tensors. as compared to block-wise cs, tensorial learning eases blocking artifacts and improves performance, especially at low measurement rates (mrs), such as $\text {mrs} < 0.1$ . the software implementation of the proposed network is publicly shared at https://github.com/mehmetyamac/gtsnet.",AB_0414
"in recent years, multi-person pose forecasting has gained significant attention due to its potential applications in various fields such as computer vision, robotics, sports analysis, and human-robot interaction. in this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model for multi-person pose forecasting called mpfsir (multi-person pose forecasting and social interaction recognition) that achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art models, but with up to 30 times fewer parameters. in addition, the model includes a social interaction prediction component to model and predict interactions between individuals. we evaluate our model on three benchmark datasets: 3dpw, cmu-mocap, and mupots-3d, compare it with state-of-the-art methods, and provide an ablation study to analyze the impact of the different model components. experimental results show the effectiveness of mpfsir in accurately predicting future poses and capturing social interactions. furthermore, we introduce the metric mw-mpjpe to evaluate the performance of pose forecasting, which focuses on motion dynamics. overall, our results highlight the potential of mpfsir for predicting the poses of multiple people and understanding social dynamics in complex scenes and in various practical applications, especially where computational resources are limited. the code is available at https://github.com/romeosajina/mpfsir.",AB_0414
"identifying political bias in news headlines holds significant importance as it influences the dissemination and consumption of news stories. however, employing conventional methods to do so poses a formidable challenge, as the short headline text is often complex and lacks sufficient syntactic and semantic context. existing approaches fail to acknowledge the potential of commonsense reasoning in facilitating text comprehension, although it has been shown to aid numerous downstream applications. to this end, to facilitate comprehension and compensate for the lack of context, we propose leveraging inferential commonsense knowledge to simplify, interpret, and explain events that are not explicitly stated in headlines. furthermore, to fully utilise its potential and deal with the unnecessary noise it may introduce, we present a method for emphasising significant inferences. using this knowledge, we introduce a novel framework, ic-bait, short for inferential commonsense aware bias identifier, which is a flexible neural network framework designed to enhance political bias prediction in news headlines. we also present two bias-annotated datasets: mediabias and goodnews. experiments on both datasets demonstrate that ic-bait significantly enhances the performance of the baseline models used in the framework. experiments on the datasets show that ic-bait improves the baseline models in terms of accuracy (2.0-10.0%), macro-averaged f-1 (2.2-22.2%), jaccard-score (up to 15.1%), and micro-averaged f-1 (up to 18.6%). our in-depth qualitative analysis reveals the scenarios in which the selected knowledge is beneficial and when it is detrimental. datasets and scripts are available at https://github.com/swati17293/ic-bait.",AB_0414
"classifying remotely sensed hyperspectral images (hsis) became a computationally demanding task given the extensive information contained throughout the spectral dimension. furthermore, burgeoning data volumes compound inherent computational and storage challenges for data processing and classification purposes. given their distributed processing capabilities, cloud environments have emerged as feasible solutions to handle these hurdles. this encourages the development of innovative distributed classification algorithms that take full advantage of the processing capabilities of such environments. recently, computational-efficient methods have been implemented to boost network convergence by reducing the required training calculations. this letter develops a novel cloud-based distributed implementation of the extreme learning machine (cc-elm) algorithm for efficient hsi classification. the proposal implements a fault-tolerant and scalable computing design while avoiding traditional batch-based backpropagation. cc-elm has been evaluated over state-of-the-art hsi classification benchmarks, yielding promising results and proving the feasibility of cloud environments for large remote sensing and hsi data volumes processing. the code available at https://github.com/mhaut/scalable-elm-hsi.",AB_0414
"background: although most adolescents have access to smartphones, few of them use mobile health (mhealth) apps for health improvement, highlighting the apparent lack of interest in mhealth apps among adolescents. adolescent mhealth interventions have been burdened with high attrition rates. research on these interventions among adolescents has frequently lacked detailed time-related attrition data alongside analysis of attrition reasons through usage.objective: the objective was to obtain daily attrition rates among adolescents in an mhealth intervention to gain a deeper understanding of attrition patterns, including the role of motivational support, such as altruistic rewards, through analysis of app usage data.methods: a randomized controlled trial was conducted with 304 adolescent participants (152 boys and 152 girls) aged 13-15 years. based on 3 participating schools, participants were randomly assigned to control, treatment as usual (tau), and intervention groups. measures were obtained at baseline, continuously throughout the 42-day trial period (research groups), and at the trial end. the mhealth app is called sidekickhealth and is a social health game with the following 3 main categories: nutrition, mental health, and physical health. primary measures were attrition based on time from launch, and the type, frequency, and time of health behavior exercise usage. outcome differences were obtained through comparison tests, while regression models and survival analyses were used for attrition measures.results: attrition differed significantly between the intervention and tau groups (44.4% vs 94.3%; & chi;21=61.220; p<.001). the mean usage duration was 6.286 days in the tau group and 24.975 days in the intervention group. in the intervention group, male participants were active significantly longer than female participants (29.155 vs 20.433 days; & chi;21=6.574; p<.001). participants in the intervention group completed a larger number of health exercises in all trial weeks, and a significant decrease in usage was observed from the first to second week in the tau group (t105=9.208; p<.001) but not in the intervention group. there was a significant increase in health exercises in the intervention group from the fifth to sixth week (t105=3.446; p<.001). such a significant increase in usage was not evident in the tau group. the research group was significantly related to attrition time (hazard ratio 0.308, 95% ci 0.222-0.420), as well as the numbers of mental health exercises (p<.001) and nutrition exercises (p<.001).conclusions: differences in attrition rates and usage between groups of adolescents were identified. motivational support is a significant factor for lowering attrition in adolescent mhealth interventions. the results point to sensitivity periods in the completion of diverse health tasks, and emphasis on time-specific attrition, along with the type, frequency, and time of health behavior exercise usage, is likely a fruitful avenue for further research on mhealth interventions for adolescent populations, in which attrition rates remain excessive.trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct05912439; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/nct05912439",AB_0414
"kinship face synthesis is an increasingly popular topic within the computer vision community, particularly the task of predicting the child appearance using parental images. previous work has been limited in terms of model capacity and inadequate training data, which comprised of low-resolution and tightly cropped images, leading to lower synthesis quality. in this paper, we propose childnet, a method for kinship face synthesis that leverages the facial image generation capabilities of a state-of-the-art generative adversarial network (gan), and resolves the aforementioned problems. childnet is designed within the gan latent space and is able to predict a child appearance that bears high resemblance to real parents' children. to ensure fine-grained control, we propose an age and gender manipulation module that allows precise manipulation of the child synthesis result. childnet is capable of generating multiple child images per parent pair input, while providing a way to control the image generation variability. additionally, we introduce a mechanism to control the dominant parent image. finally, to facilitate the task of kinship face synthesis, we introduce a new kinship dataset, called next of kin. this dataset contains 3690 high-resolution face images with a diverse range of ethnicities and ages. we evaluate childnet in comprehensive experiments against three competing kinship face synthesis models, using two kinship datasets. the experiments demonstrate the superior performance of childnet in terms of identity similarity, while exhibiting high perceptual image quality. the source code for the model is publicly available at: https://github.com/martinpernus/childnet.",AB_0414
