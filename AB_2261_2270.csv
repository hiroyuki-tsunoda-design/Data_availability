"motivation protein-protein interactions (ppi) are crucial components of the biomolecular networks that enable cells to function. biological experiments have identified a large number of ppi, and these interactions are stored in knowledge bases. however, these interactions are often restricted to specific cellular environments and conditions. network activity can be characterized as the extent of agreement between a ppi network (ppin) and a distinct cellular environment measured by protein mass spectrometry, and it can also be quantified as a statistical significance score. without knowing the activity of these ppi in the cellular environments or specific phenotypes, it is impossible to reveal how these ppi perform and affect cellular functioning.results to calculate the activity of ppin in different cellular conditions, we proposed a ppin activity evaluation framework named activeppi to measure the consistency between network architecture and protein measurement data. activeppi estimates the probability density of protein mass spectrometry abundance and models ppin using a markov-random-field-based method. furthermore, empirical p-value is derived based on a nonparametric permutation test to quantify the likelihood significance of the match between ppin structure and protein abundance data. extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of activeppi and result in network activity evaluation, pathway activity assessment, and optimal network architecture tuning tasks. to summarize it succinctly, activeppi is a versatile tool for evaluating ppi network that can uncover the functional significance of protein interactions in crucial cellular biological processes and offer further insights into physiological phenomena.availability and implementation all source code and data are freely available at https://github.com/zpliulab/activeppi.",AB_0227
"motivation single-cell dna methylation sequencing can assay dna methylation at single-cell resolution. however, incomplete coverage compromises related downstream analyses, outlining the importance of imputation techniques. with a rising number of cell samples in recent large datasets, scalable and efficient imputation models are critical to addressing the sparsity for genome-wide analyses.results we proposed a novel graph-based deep learning approach to impute methylation matrices based on locus-aware neighboring subgraphs with locus-aware encoding orienting on one cell type. merely using the cpgs methylation matrix, the obtained graphcpg outperforms previous methods on datasets containing more than hundreds of cells and achieves competitive performance on smaller datasets, with subgraphs of predicted sites visualized by retrievable bipartite graphs. besides better imputation performance with increasing cell number, it significantly reduces computation time and demonstrates improvement in downstream analysis.availability and implementation the source code is freely available at https://github.com/yuzhong-deng/graphcpg.git.",AB_0227
"objective. automated medical image segmentation is vital for the prevention and treatment of disease. however, medical data commonly exhibit class imbalance in practical applications, which may lead to unclear boundaries of specific classes and make it difficult to effectively segment certain tail classes in the results of semi-supervised medical image segmentation. approach. we propose a novel multi-task contrastive learning framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation with multi-scale uncertainty estimation. specifically, the framework includes a student-teacher model. we introduce global image-level contrastive learning in the encoder to address the class imbalance and local pixel-level contrastive learning in the decoder to achieve intra-class aggregation and inter-class separation. furthermore, we propose a multi-scale uncertainty-aware consistency loss to reduce noise caused by pseudo-label bias. main results. experiments on three public datasets acdc, la and lits show that our method achieves higher segmentation performance compared with state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods. significance. the multi-task contrastive learning in our method facilitates the negative impact of class imbalance and achieves better classification results. the multi-scale uncertainty estimation encourages consistent predictions for the same input under different perturbations, motivating the teacher model to generate high-quality pseudo-labels. code is available at https://github.com/msctransu/mcssmu.git.",AB_0227
"backgroundcross-linking mass spectrometry (xl-ms) is a powerful technique for detecting protein-protein interactions (ppis) and modeling protein structures in a high-throughput manner. in xl-ms experiments, proteins are cross-linked by a chemical reagent (namely cross-linker), fragmented, and then fed into a tandem mass spectrum (ms/ms). cross-linkers are either cleavable or non-cleavable, and each type requires distinct data analysis tools. however, both types of cross-linkers suffer from imbalanced fragmentation efficiency, resulting in a large number of unidentifiable spectra that hinder the discovery of ppis and protein conformations. to address this challenge, researchers have sought to improve the sensitivity of xl-ms through invention of novel cross-linking reagents, optimization of sample preparation protocols, and development of data analysis algorithms. one promising approach to developing new data analysis methods is to apply a protein feedback mechanism in the analysis. it has significantly improved the sensitivity of analysis methods in the cleavable cross-linking data. the application of the protein feedback mechanism to the analysis of non-cleavable cross-linking data is expected to have an even greater impact because the majority of xl-ms experiments currently employs non-cleavable cross-linkers.resultsin this study, we applied the protein feedback mechanism to the analysis of both non-cleavable and cleavable cross-linking data and observed a substantial improvement in cross-link spectrum matches (csms) compared to conventional methods. furthermore, we developed a new software program, ecl 3.0, that integrates two algorithms and includes a user-friendly graphical interface to facilitate wider applications of this new program.conclusionsecl 3.0 source code is available at https://github.com/yuweichuan/ecl-pf.git. a quick tutorial is available at https://youtu.be/ppzgbi8v2xi.",AB_0227
"accurate and timely impervious surface mapping is essential for assessing land cover change, urban heat island, and monitoring human activity intensity and ecological change. while various global impervious surface datasets become available, these datasets exhibit significant omissions in arctic regions. hence, in this study, we present a 30-m impervious surface area (isa) dataset of arctic from 1985 to 2021 (gisa_arcitc). to this aim, we proposed to combine visually interpreted isa samples and automatically generated nonisa samples for arctic isa mapping. then, adaptive random forest (rf) classifiers were used for long time-series isa mapping and the result was post-processed to improve the spatial-temporal consistency. finally, the accuracy of gisa_arcitc was assessed using the 37,800 independent test samples. gisa_arctic possessed an overall accuracy of 93.59 % and a f-score of 0.934. it is found that the arctic isa increased from 857.83 km2 to 2115.49 km2 during the past 37 years. more than 84 % of the arctic isa increment is embraced by three countries: russia, finland, and norway. courtesy of the long time-series gisa_arctic, the sources of arctic isa expansion were further analyzed. it was found that the top three land covers transformed to isa are tundra, forest and grassland. the gisa_arctic could contribute to further understanding of human activities and arctic ecological changes, which can be accessed from http://irsi p.whu.edu.cn/resources/resources_v2.php.",AB_0227
"motivation accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity (dta) is crucial for drug discovery. the increase in the publication of large-scale dta datasets enables the development of various computational methods for dta prediction. numerous deep learning-based methods have been proposed to predict affinities, some of which only utilize original sequence information or complex structures, but the effective combination of various information and protein-binding pockets have not been fully mined. therefore, a new method that integrates available key information is urgently needed to predict dta and accelerate the drug discovery process.results in this study, we propose a novel deep learning-based predictor termed datadta to estimate the affinities of drug-target pairs. datadta utilizes descriptors of predicted pockets and sequences of proteins, as well as low-dimensional molecular features and smiles strings of compounds as inputs. specifically, the pockets were predicted from the three-dimensional structure of proteins and their descriptors were extracted as the partial input features for dta prediction. the molecular representation of compounds based on algebraic graph features was collected to supplement the input information of targets. furthermore, to ensure effective learning of multiscale interaction features, a dual-interaction aggregation neural network strategy was developed. datadta was compared with state-of-the-art methods on different datasets, and the results showed that datadta is a reliable prediction tool for affinities estimation. specifically, the concordance index (ci) of datadta is 0.806 and the pearson correlation coefficient (r) value is 0.814 on the test dataset, which is higher than other methods.availability and implementation the codes and datasets of datadta are available at https://github.com/yanzhu06/datadta.",AB_0227
"the accurate prediction of the effect of amino acid mutations for protein-protein interactions (ppi $\delta \delta g$) is a crucial task in protein engineering, as it provides insight into the relevant biological processes underpinning protein binding and provides a basis for further drug discovery. in this study, we propose mpbppi, a novel multi-task pre-training-based geometric equivariance-preserving framework to predict ppi $\delta \delta g$. pre-training on a strictly screened pre-training dataset is employed to address the scarcity of protein-protein complex structures annotated with ppi $\delta \delta g$ values. mpbppi employs a multi-task pre-training technique, forcing the framework to learn comprehensive backbone and side chain geometric regulations of protein-protein complexes at different scales. after pre-training, mpbppi can generate high-quality representations capturing the effective geometric characteristics of labeled protein-protein complexes for downstream $\delta \delta g$ predictions. mpbppi serves as a scalable framework supporting different sources of mutant-type (mt) protein-protein complexes for flexible application. experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that mpbppi is a state-of-the-art framework for ppi $\delta \delta g$ predictions. the data and source code are available at https://github.com/arantir123/mpbppi.",AB_0227
"micrornas (mirnas) silence genes by binding to messenger rnas, whereas long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) act as competitive endogenous rnas (cernas) that can relieve mirna silencing effects and upregulate target gene expression. the cerna association between lncrnas and mirnas has been a research hotspot due to its medical importance, but it is challenging to verify experimentally. in this paper, we propose a novel deep learning scheme, i.e. sequence pre-training-based graph neural network (spgnn), that combines pre-training and fine-tuning stages to predict lncrna-mirna associations from rna sequences and the existing interactions represented as a graph. first, we utilize a sequence-to-vector technique to generate pre-trained embeddings based on the sequences of all rnas during the pre-training stage. in the fine-tuning stage, we use graph neural network to learn node representations from the heterogeneous graph constructed using lncrna-mirna association information. we evaluate our proposed scheme spgnn on our newly collected animal lncrna-mirna association dataset and demonstrate that combining the $k$-mer technique and doc2vec model for pre-training with the simple graph convolution network for fine-tuning is effective in predicting lncrna-mirna associations. our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various evaluation metrics. we also conduct an ablation study and hyperparameter analysis to verify the effectiveness of each component and parameter of our scheme. the complete code and dataset are available on github: https://github.com/zixwang/spgnn.",AB_0227
"single-cell high-throughput chromatin conformation capture technologies (schi-c) has been used to map chromatin spatial organization in complex tissues. however, computational tools to detect differential chromatin contacts (dccs) from schi-c datasets in development and through disease pathogenesis are still lacking. here, we present snaphic-d, a computational pipeline to identify dccs between two schi-c datasets. compared to methods designed for bulk hi-c data, snaphic-d detects dccs with high sensitivity and accuracy. we used snaphic-d to identify cell-type-specific chromatin contacts at 10 kb resolution in mouse hippocampal and human prefrontal cortical tissues, demonstrating that dccs detected in the hippocampal and cortical cell types are generally associated with cell-type-specific gene expression patterns and epigenomic features. snaphic-d is freely available at https://github.com/huminglab/snaphic-d.",AB_0227
"silencers are noncoding dna sequence fragments located on the genome that suppress gene expression. the variation of silencers in specific cells is closely related to gene expression and cancer development. computational approaches that exclusively rely on dna sequence information for silencer identification fail to account for the cell specificity of silencers, resulting in diminished accuracy. despite the discovery of several transcription factors and epigenetic modifications associated with silencers on the genome, there is still no definitive biological signal or combination thereof to fully characterize silencers, posing challenges in selecting suitable biological signals for their identification. therefore, we propose a sophisticated deep learning framework called deepicsh, which is based on multiple biological data sources. specifically, deepicsh leverages a deep convolutional neural network to automatically capture biologically relevant signal combinations strongly associated with silencers, originating from a diverse array of biological signals. furthermore, the utilization of attention mechanisms facilitates the scoring and visualization of these signal combinations, whereas the employment of skip connections facilitates the fusion of multilevel sequence features and signal combinations, thereby empowering the accurate identification of silencers within specific cells. extensive experiments on hepg2 and k562 cell line data sets demonstrate that deepicsh outperforms state-of-the-art methods in silencer identification. notably, we introduce for the first time a deep learning framework based on multi-omics data for classifying strong and weak silencers, achieving favorable performance. in conclusion, deepicsh shows great promise for advancing the study and analysis of silencers in complex diseases. the source code is available at https://github.com/lyli1013/deepicsh.",AB_0227
