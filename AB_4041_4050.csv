"reproducibility is crucial for scientific progress, yet a clear research data analysis workflow is challenging to implement and maintain. as a result, a record of computational steps performed on the data to arrive at the key research findings is often missing. we developed scikick, a tool that eases the configuration, execution, and presentation of scientific computational analyses. scikick allows for workflow configurations with notebooks as the units of execution, defines a standard structure for the project, automatically tracks the defined interdependencies between the data analysis steps, and implements methods to compile all research results into a cohesive final report. utilities provided by scikick help turn the complicated management of transparent data analysis workflows into a standardized and feasible practice. scikick version 0.2.1 code and documentation is available as supplementary material. the scikick software is available on github (https://github.com/matthewcarlucci/scikick) and is distributed with pypi (https://pypi.org/project/scikick/) under a gpl-3 license.",AB_0405
"motivation: identifying the probable positions of the protein side-chains is one of the protein modelling steps that can improve the prediction of protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions. most of the strategies predicting the side-chain conformations use predetermined dihedral angle lists, also called rotamer libraries, that are usually generated from a subset of high-quality protein structures. although these methods are fast to apply, they tend to average out geometries instead of taking into account the surrounding atoms and molecules and ignore structures not included in the selected subset. such simplifications can result in inaccuracies when predicting possible side-chain atom positions. results: we propose an approach that takes into account both of these circumstances by scanning through sterically accessible side-chain conformations and generating dihedral angle libraries specific to the target proteins. the method avoids the drawbacks of lacking conformations due to unusual or rare protein structures and successfully suggests potential rotamers with average rmsd closer to the experimentally determined side-chain atom positions than other widely used rotamer libraries. availability and implementation: the technique is implemented in open-source software package rotag and available at github: https://www.github.com/agrybauskas/rotag, under gnu lesser general public license.",AB_0405
"we present geliosphere, a numerical model of the modulation of cosmic rays in the heliosphere. the current version of geliosphere implements the stochastic differential equation method to solve parker's equation. sets of 1d and 2d models of geliosphere solve parker's equation in a backward-in-time manner for 2d models and in a backward-in-time and forward-in-time manner for 1d models. geliosphere offers gpu-accelerated implementations of all models. geliosphere also offers multithread cpu implementations of all available models for users who do not have access to gpus. to verify the geliosphere 2d model results at different heliospheric latitudes and radii, we show that the geliosphere 2d model, with implemented heliospheric polar field modification, fits well with measurements provided by the kiel electron telescope (ket), which is part of the ulysses cosmic ray and solar particle investigation (cospin) experiment.program summary program title: geliospherecpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /9sb2ywg65w.1developer's repository link: https://github .com /msolanik /geliospherelicensing provisions: bsd-3-clauseprogramming language: c++nature of problem: calculation of the modulation of cosmic rays in the heliosphere including drift effects. implement a heliospheric magnetic field model with polar correction used for simulation to describe nonecliptic measurements. implementation of modulation models for cpu and gpu environments. solution method: stochastic differential equations are used to solve parker's equation in forward-in -time and backward-in-time manners. the forward-in-time approach is used for the one-dimensional heliosphere model and the backward-in-time approach for one and two-dimensional heliosphere models. the two-dimensional model results are verified with measurements of the ulysses spacecraft in non -ecliptic regions of the inner heliosphere.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0405
"time-resolved photoluminescence (trpl) is a powerfultool to investigatecharge carrier recombination processes in emissive materials. perovskitematerials are extremely promising for applications in solar cells;however, the interpretation of their trpl is arduous due to the complicatednature of the recombination processes occurring in these materials.we present here the perovskite carrier recombination simulator (pears)web tool for effortlessly and quickly fitting trpl of perovskite materialsusing advanced charge carrier recombination models, allowing for theextraction of recombination rate constants and trap state concentration.pears is flexible and can adapt to different situations, by ignoringrecombination processes or fixing known parameters (e.g., the dopingconcentration). the tool is publicly available at https://pears-tool.herokuapp.com.",AB_0405
"thirteen hypselostomatid microsnails have been reported so far from cambodia: 10 species from the mekong delta karsts in the south and three species from the sisophon-battambang limestone hills in the west. herein, gyliotrachela torticollis benthem jutting, 1962, the only species previously reported from the battambang, is redescribed based on near-type locality specimens. we describe a new species, gyliotrachela khmeriana sp. nov., from the cambodian sisophon-battambang limestone hills. this new species differs from all other known hypselostomatid species in having a short and straight tuba, protoconch sculptures with shallow pits and spiral striations, and apertural dentition with parietal, angular, and four other lamellae on the palatal wall. in addition, specimens of 'anauchen srakeoensis panha and burch, 2004', previously recorded only in thailand, were collected from limestone hills in sisophon, redescribed based on shell morphology and taxonomically relocated as a member of the hypselostoma.http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:1c13858d-be2e-45cf-8bea-b5c99c8a8648",AB_0405
"the spatio-temporal variation of surface water storage (sws) in the congo river basin (crb), the second-largest watershed in the world, remains widely unknown. in this study, satellite-derived observations are combined to estimate sws dynamics at the crb and sub-basin scales over 1992-2015. two methods are employed. the first one combines surface water extent (swe) from the global inundation extent from multisatellite (giems-2) dataset and the long-term satellite-derived surface water height from multi-mission radar altimetry. the second one, based on the hypsometric curve approach, combines swe from giems-2 with topographic data from four global digital elevation models (dems), namely the terra advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (aster), advanced land observing satellite (alos), multierror-removed improved terrain (merit), and forest and buildings removed copernicus dem (fabdem). the results provide sws variations at monthly time steps from 1992 to 2015 characterized by a strong seasonal and interannual variability with an annual mean amplitude of similar to 101 +/- 23 km(3). the middle congo sub-basin shows a higher mean annual amplitude ( similar to 71 +/- 15 km(3)). the comparison of sws derived from the two methods and four dems shows an overall fair agreement. the sws estimates are assessed against satellite precipitation data and in situ river discharge and, in general, a relatively fair agreement is found between the three hydrological variables at the basin and sub-basin scales (linear correlation coefficient > 0 :5). we further characterize the spatial distribution of the major drought that occurred across the basin at the end of 2005 and in early 2006. the sws estimates clearly reveal the widespread spatial distribution of this severe event ( similar to 40% deficit as compared to their long-term average), in accordance with the large negative anomaly observed in precipitation over that period. this new sws long-term dataset over the congo river basin is an unprecedented new source of information for improving our comprehension of hydrological and biogeochemical cycles in the basin. as the datasets used in our study are available globally, our study opens opportunities to further develop satellitederived sws estimates at the global scale. the dataset of the crb's sws and the related python code to run the reproducibility of the hypsometric curve approach dataset of sws are respectively available for download at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo. 7299823 and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8011607 (kitambo et al., 2022b, 2023).",AB_0405
"this study presents a new nature-inspired optimization algorithm, namely the mantis search algorithm (msa), inspired by the unique hunting behavior and sexual cannibalism of praying mantises. in brief, msa consists of three optimization stages, including the search for prey (exploration), attack prey (exploitation), and sexual cannibalism. those operators are simulated using various mathematical models to effectively tackle optimization challenges across diverse search spaces. the performance of msa is rigorously tested on fifty-two optimization problems and three real-world applications (five engineering design problems, and the parameter estimation problem of photovoltaic modules and fuel cells) to show its versatility and adaptability to different scenarios. to disclose the msa's superiority, it is compared to two categories from the rival optimizers: the first category involves well-established and highly-cited optimizers, like differential evolution; and the second category contains recently-published algorithms, like african vultures optimization algorithm. this comparison is conducted using several performance metrics, the wilcoxon rank-sum test and the friedman mean rank to disclose the msa's effectiveness and efficiency. the results of this comparison highlight the effectiveness of this new approach and its potential for future optimization applications. the source codes of the msa algorithm are publicly available at https://www.mathworks.com/matl abcentral/fileexchange/131833-mantis-search-algorithm-msa.",AB_0405
"background: mucinous rectal cancer is associated with a higher incidence of microsatellite instability and a poorer response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy compared to other subtypes of rectal adenocarcinoma. immune checkpoint inhibitors are an emerging family of anticancer therapeutics associated with highly variable outcomes in colorectal cancer. although the immune landscape of mucinous rectal cancer has not been fully explored, the presence of mucin is thought to act as a barrier preventing immune-cell infiltration. objective: the aim of this study was to determine the immune properties of mucinous rectal cancer and investigate the degree of lymphocyte infiltration in this cohort. design: this is a retrospective cohort study that involved multiplexed immunofluorescence staining of tumor microarrays. settings: samples originated from a single university teaching hospital. patients: our cohort included 15 cases of mucinous and 43 cases of nonmucinous rectal cancer. main outcome measures: immune cells were classified and quantified. immune-cell counts were compared between mucinous and nonmucinous cohorts. immune marker expression within tumor epithelial tissue was evaluated to determine the degree of lymphocyte infiltration. results: cytotoxic (p = 0.022) and regulatory t cells (p = 0.010) were found to be overrepresented in the mucinous cohort compared to the nonmucinous group. programmed cell death protein 1 expression was also found to be significantly greater in the mucinous group (p = 0.001). cd3 (p = 0.001) and cd8 (p = 0.054) expressions within the tumor epithelium were also higher in the mucinous group, suggesting adequate immune infiltration despite the presence of mucin. in our analysis, microsatellite instability status was not a predictor of immune marker expression. limitations: the relatively small size of the cohort. conclusions: mucinous rectal cancer is associated with an immune-rich tumor microenvironment, which was not associated with microsatellite instability status. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c65.",AB_0405
"clinical interpretation of copy number variants (cnvs) is a complex process that requires skilled clinical professionals. general recommendations have been recently released to guide the cnv interpretation based on predefined criteria to uniform the decision process. several semiautomatic computational methods have been proposed to recommend appropriate choices, relieving clinicians of tedious searching in vast genomic databases. we have developed and evaluated such a tool called marcnv and tested it on cnv records collected from the clinvar database. alternatively, the emerging machine learning-based tools, such as the recently published isv (interpretation of structural variants), showed promising ways of even fully automated predictions using broader characterization of affected genomic elements. such tools utilize features additional to acmg criteria, thus providing supporting evidence and the potential to improve cnv classification. since both approaches contribute to evaluation of cnvs clinical impact, we propose a combined solution in the form of a decision support tool based on automated acmg guidelines (marcnv) supplemented by a machine learning-based pathogenicity prediction (isv) for the classification of cnvs. we provide evidence that such a combined approach is able to reduce the number of uncertain classifications and reveal potentially incorrect classifications using automated guidelines. cnv interpretation using marcnv, isv, and combined approach is available for non-commercial use at https://predict.genovisio.com/.",AB_0405
