"rgb-infrared person re-identification (rgb-ir reid) aims to associate people across disjoint rgb and ir camera views. currently, state-of-the-art performance of rgb-ir reid is not as impressive as that of conventional reid. much of that is due to the notorious modality bias training issue brought by the single-modality imagenet pre-training, which might yield rgb-biased representations that severely hinder the cross-modality image retrieval. this paper makes first attempt to tackle the task from a pre-training perspective. we propose a self-supervised pre-training solution, named modality-aware multiple granularity learning (mmgl), which directly trains models from scratch only on multi-modal reid datasets, but achieving competitive results against imagenet pre-training, without using any external data or sophisticated tuning tricks. first, we develop a simple-but-effective 'permutation recovery' pretext task that globally maps shuffled rgb-ir images into a shared latent permutation space, providing modality-invariant global representations for downstream reid tasks. second, we present a part-aware cycle-contrastive (pcc) learning strategy that utilizes cross-modality cycle-consistency to maximize agreement between semantically similar rgb-ir image patches. this enables contrastive learning for the unpaired multi-modal scenarios, further improving the discriminability of local features without laborious instance augmentation. based on these designs, mmgl effectively alleviates the modality bias training problem. extensive experiments demonstrate that it learns better representations (+8.03% rank-1 accuracy) with faster training speed (converge only in few hours) and higher data efficiency (< 5% data size) than imagenet pre-training. the results also suggest it generalizes well to various existing models, losses and has promising transferability across datasets. the code will be released at https://github.com/hansonchen1996/mmgl.",AB_0287
"the characteristics of very high-resolution (vhr) remote sensing images (rsis) have higher spatial resolution inherently and are easier to obtain globally compared with hyperspectral images (hsis), making it possible to detect small-scale land cover changes in multiple applications. rsi change detection (rsi-cd) based on deep learning has been paid attention to become a frontier research field in recent years and is currently facing two challenging problems. the first is high dependence on registration between bitemporal images caused by high spatial resolution. the other is high pseudo-change information response caused by low spectral resolution. in order to address the abovementioned two problems, a novel rsi-cd framework called geospatial-awareness network (gesanet) based on the geospatial position matching mechanism (pmm) with multilevel adjustment and the geospatial content reasoning mechanism (crm) with diverse pseudo-change information filtering is proposed. first, the pmm assigns independent 2-d offset coordinates to each position in the previous temporal image. afterward, bilinear interpolation is employed to obtain the subpixel feature value after the offset, and the sparse results based on the difference are transmitted to the next level prediction to realize multilevel geospatial correction. the crm extracts the global features from the corrected sparse feature map in terms of dimensions, implementing effective discriminant feature extraction on the basis of the original feature map in a stepwise refinement manner through the cross-dimension exchange mechanism, to filter out various pseudo-change information as well as maintain real change information. comparison experiments with five recent state-of-the-art (sota) methods are carried out on two popular datasets with diverse changes, and the results show that the proposed method has good robustness and validity for multitemporal rsi-cd. in particular, it has a strong comparative advantage in detecting small entity changes and edge details. the source code of the proposed framework can be downloaded from https://github.com/zxylnnu/gesanet.",AB_0287
"with the rapid development of remote sensing sensor technology, the number of remote sensing images (rsis) has exploded. how to effectively retrieve and manage this massive data have become an urgent problem. at present, content-based image retrieval (cbir) methods have become a mainstream method due to their excellent performance. however, most of the existing retrieval methods only consider the global features of images, which lacks the ability to discriminate images with the same semantic information but different visual representations. to alleviate this issue, supervised contrastive learning based on the fusion of global and local features method is proposed in this article, named scfr. first, a fusion module is designed to combine global and local features to enhance the ability of image expression. second, supervised contrastive learning is introduced into the retrieval task to effectively improve the feature distribution, so that the positive sample pairs are close to each other, and the negative sample pairs are far away from each other in the feature space. furthermore, to make the distribution of features of the same class more compact, the center contrastive loss is added to the constraints and combines the class centers that change iteratively with the network. experimental results on three rsi datasets show that our proposed method has a more effective retrieval performance than the state-of-the-art methods. the code and models are available at https://github.com/xdplay17/scfr.",AB_0287
"real-time 3-d mapping of large-scale global navigation satellite system (gnss)-denied environments plays an important role in forest inventory management, disaster emergency response, and underground facility maintenance. compact helmet laser scanning (hls) systems keep the same direction as the user's line of sight and have the advantage of what you see is what you get, providing a promising and efficient solution for 3-d geospatial information acquisition. however, the violent motion of the helmet, the limited field of view (fov) of the laser scanner, and the repeated symmetrical geometric structures in the gnss-denied environments pose enormous challenges for the existing simultaneous localization and mapping (slam) algorithms. to promote the development of hls and explore its application in large-scale gnss-denied environments, the first large-scale hls dataset covering multiple difficult gnss-denied areas (e.g., forests, mountains, underground spaces) was built in this study. besides using an additional very high accuracy fiber-optic inertial measurement unit (imu), a novel postprocessing multisource fusion method-progressive trajectory correction (ptc)-is proposed to generate a reliable ground-truth trajectory for the benchmark, which overcomes the problems of scan matching degradation and nonrigid distortion. the accuracies of the ground truth are controlled and checked by manually surveyed feature points along the trajectory. finally, the existing state-of-the-art slam methods were evaluated on the whu-helmet dataset, summarizing the future hls slam research trends. the full dataset is available for download at: https://github.com/kafeiyin00/whu-helmetdataset.",AB_0287
"despite its fruitful applications in remote sensing, image super-resolution (sr) is troublesome to train and deploy as it handles different resolution magnifications with separate models. accordingly, we propose a highly applicable sr framework called funsr, which settles different magnifications with a unified model by exploiting context interaction within implicit function space. funsr composes a functional representor, a functional interactor, and a functional parser. specifically, the representor transforms the low-resolution image from euclidean space to multiscale pixelwise function maps; the interactor enables pixelwise function expression with global dependencies; and the parser, which is parameterized by the interactor's output, converts the discrete coordinates with additional attributes to rgb values. extensive experimental results demonstrate that funsr reports the state-of-the-art performance on both fixed- and continuous-magnification settings; meanwhile, it provides many friendly applications due to its unified nature. our code is available at https://github.com/kyanchen/funsr.",AB_0287
"the goal of pan-sharpening is to produce a high-spatial-resolution multispectral (hrms) image from a low-spatial-resolution multispectral (lrms) counterpart by super-resolving the lrms one under the guidance of a texture-rich panchromatic (pan) image. existing research has concentrated on using spatial information to generate hrms images, but has neglected to investigate the frequency domain, which severely restricts the performance improvement. in this work, we propose a novel pan-sharpening approach, named multiscale dual-domain guidance network (msddn) by fully exploring and exploiting the distinguished information in both the spatial and frequency domains. specifically, the network is inborn with multiscale u-shape manner and composed by two core parts: a spatial guidance subnetwork for fusing local spatial information and a frequency guidance subnetwork for fusing global frequency domain information and encouraging dual-domain complementary learning. in this way, the model can capture multiscale dual-domain information to help it generate high-quality pan-sharpening results. employing the proposed model on different datasets, the quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our method performs appreciatively against other state-of-the-art (sota) approaches and comprises a strong generalization ability for real-world scenes. the source code is available at https://github.com/alexhe101/msddn.",AB_0287
"hyperspectral images (hsis) contain rich spatial and spectral information about the earth, and are widely used in the remote sensing field. however, an hsi is frequently corrupted by various types of noise, such as gaussian noise, sparse noise, stripe noise, and so on, which severely limits the subsequent application of the hsi. in this article, we propose a graph laplacian regularizer (glr) to exploit the low-rank information across the bands of the hsi. compared with the traditional low-rank regularization, our graph laplacian regularization can achieve equivalent or better performance with less time consumption. besides, a sparse constraint and a lowrank constraint are employed to remove the sparse and stripe noise. in addition, the augmented lagrangian multiplier is used to solve each component to restore a clean image. finally, we have carried out experiments on the simulated and real noisy hsi data. the results show the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods, in terms of psnr and ssim, time cost, and visual effect. the matlab code is available through: https://github.com/zzhang-99/fglr.",AB_0287
"change detection is an important tool for long-term earth observation missions. it takes bi-temporal images as input and predicts where the change has occurred. different from other dense prediction tasks, a meaningful consideration for change detection is the interaction between bi-temporal features. with this motivation, in this article we propose a novel general change detection architecture, metachanger, which includes a series of alternative interaction layers in the feature extractor. to verify the effectiveness of metachanger, we propose two derived models, changerad and changerex with simple interaction strategies: aggregation-distribution (ad) and feature exchange. ad is abstracted from some complex interaction methods, and feature exchange is a completely parameter and computation-free operation by exchanging bi-temporal features. in addition, for better alignment of bi-temporal features, we propose a flow-based dual-alignment fusion (fdaf) module which allows interactive alignment and feature fusion. crucially, we observe changer series models achieve competitive performance on different scale change detection datasets. further, our proposed changerad and changerex could serve as a starting baseline for future metachanger design. code and weights are made available at https://github.com/likyoo/open-cd.",AB_0287
"super-resolution (sr) is one of the powerful techniques to improve image quality for low-resolution (lr) hyperspectral image (hsi) with insufficient detail and noise. traditional methods typically perform simple cascade or addition during the fusion of the auxiliary high-resolution (hr) rgb and lr hsi. as a result, the abundant hr rgb details are not utilized as a priori information to enhance the hsi feature representation, leaving room for further improvements. to address this issue, we propose an rgb-induced feature modulation network for hsi sr (ifmsr). considering that similar patterns are common in images, a multi-corresponding patch aggregation is designed to globally assemble this contextual information, which is beneficial for feature learning. besides, to adequately exploit plentiful hr rgb details, an rgb-induced detail enhancement (rde) module and a deep cross-modality feature modulation (cfm) module are proposed to transfer the supplementary materials from rgb to hsi. these modules can provide a more direct and instructive representation, leading to further edge recovery. experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable performance under more realistic degradation condition. our code is publicly available at https://github.com/qianngli/ifmsr.",AB_0287
"the building is a critical urban element for developing smart cities. building extraction research has experienced rapid development due to abundant remote sensing image data availability. building extraction methods have recently focused on enhancing regional accuracy without obtaining refined building boundaries and do not fit the concave-convex shape of the building and have significant sawtooth noise. this article proposes a building shape-preserving framework to solve the imperfect boundary problem. to delineate the concave and convex building boundaries from remote sensing images, we combine coarse- and fine-grained information with the instance segmentation method, mask region-based convolutional neural network (r-cnn), which can further refine the indeterminate boundary points, and perform inward fitting of the building boundary. a regular boundary network is designed to learn the features of the edges and footprints to calculate the boundary loss that can smoothen the boundary noise, considering the imperfect boundaries and sawtooth noise in the extracted building boundary. furthermore, to enhance the ability to evaluate the extracted building shape, a building footprint information evaluation algorithm, the footprint distance metric, is proposed to calculate the footprint distance between each building boundary. comparing the building extraction results indicates that the proposed method achieves excellent quantitative evaluation scores. experiments performed using spacenet and wuhan university (whu) datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method are detailed. the experimental results indicate that the algorithm utilizes the powerful edge extraction capability of the method to exhibit excellent performance in terms of extracting building edges from complex remote sensing scenes. code is available at https://github.com/annacug/boundary-shape-preserving-model.",AB_0287
